The AM (members of the parliament) of Welsh are concerned with 'mate-like images'
Some of the members of the parliament objected to the suggestion that their term should be replaced by MWP.
The reason for this is that the name of the parliament has been changed to a plan to reform Welsh.
All AMs linked to politics are concerned that it can make them laugh.
A lab AM said, "Don't add this to Twp and Pwp," and his group was worried about this.
For readers out of Wales: in Welsh, towp means stupid and towp means dirty.
One Play AM said the whole group was "not happy" and suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said that its group was "self-thinking", but he noted that the word could be redesigned by verbally minor changes.
In this context, the w-word in Welsh is made exactly the same as the y-word in the Yorkshire English-language.
With a change in the name, the legal committee that is currently preparing the legal meeting said: "What members of the parliament are called upon to say in this regard will certainly be a final decision of any descriptor for members."
According to the Wales government Act 2017, the Welsh parliament has the right to change its name.
In June, the foundation was mentioned on the results of the public advice, which had received much more support to change the name of the parliament and reform the Welsh.
In the case of the title of the AM term, the aid supported the members of Welsh, or WMP, but the most supported in the public advice was the MWP option.
Obviously, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but the regret officer is having a lot of difficulty in obtaining common agreement for Elin Jones, they hope that they will present legal compensation for change within a few weeks.
Other changes will also be included in the working methods of the Committee on Legal Development, which includes rules and the format of the committee system for AM's incompatibility.
When discussing the law creation, AM will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called upon to say.
Macedonians are going to protest to rename the country
On Sunday, they will argue that they have to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not."
A speech was made for the Mashhur Tedand to resolve the decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, whose name is Macedonia.
Athens has been emphasising quite a long time ago that his northern neighbor's name tells of his country and he has also suffered many hardships over his membership in Jehu and NATO.
The Macedonian president of the population says they're going to ignore Tidan.
Although Prime Minister Zoran Zew and his supporters have argued that the change in the name is only due to the inclusion of Jehu and NATO.
The churches in Harlem have reduced the sound of St. Martin’s bells
Mr. Adams said, "The elderly I spoke to about history are saying that there were times and churches on every occasion."
"Today, it's all coming to an end."
He understands the lack of time.
They said, “The people of the present are in different ways.”
"There are now no living rooms in the neighborhood where people go every day."
For churches, they are concerned that money will not be spent more than expected by the leaders, "and these money will soon end or later the leaders will come to the right place from which they started."
He added that the churches might have been transformed into real estate buildings, where people like different people would not be able to protect the remaining places around them.
They said, "These buildings will increase the number of people who buy houses as their real estate, and thus will come at a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is not possible that most of those who have acquired property will become members of these churches.
A decade after St. Martin’s 1870s, Black Metropolis - Metropolis of Harlem was created by both churchgoers before they became Communists.
The fundamental deaf people of the Methodist religious community passed away in the 1930s.
These buildings were seized by the ignorant men of the religious community who worshiped the surrounding places.
At St. Martin, the priest John Howard Johnson was captured by an unstable religious community that had led the removal of El Salvador's vendors on 125th Street, the place was the main place for buying in Harlem, which was opposed to keeping and promoting the people of Azerbaijan.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but it was launched here after the restoration plans were made by the followers of Father Johnson.
Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's successor priest David Johnson proudly said "Open the doors of the kind for the poor."
The watchmaker in July described it as "a cultural heritage" and "a precious historical instrument".
The University of Michigan expert Tiffany Nji also noted that this was the first hour of the world played by Asian musician Dionysio A. Lind, who played a very large hour in the Reversed Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merrieveder said that they were not replaced by anyone else in St. Martin.
Whatever happened in St. Martin in the last few months, it became a complex story of filmmakers and filmmakers, some of whom were appointed by the church’s general leaders, and others by the lands of religion.
Westry (which is the object of worship) but the authority of the Parises (the local priests) was expressed in July - worried that the province would "request to meet the guests for the West", whether or not it included the sponsors and architects appointed in Westry.
Some of the local priests complained about the lack of clarity.

Plans out Sainsbury's to go to the UK Boot Market
Sainsbury's Booty's Specialist is currently joining the Department Store Style Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams.
Although it is going to be part of the 2.8 billion-pound Juke's boutique market, these volumes will be sold in 11 stores in the country, and if this plan is successful, the next year will be increased to more than one store.
Sub-markets are being introduced into the boot, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing TV, microwave and household goods.
Sainsbury's stated that it would be the first to bring up 3,000 products to double its products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing products of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more opportunities with branded products found in Boots' shop.
Supermarket is also relaunching its botanical makeup products so that most products are vignette-friendly - it will increase its demand in small-scale retailers to some extent.
In addition, Perfume Riteller Fragrance Shop will also examine the two stores of Sainsbury's, one of which was opened in South London last week, and the other at the end of this year is open in Celly Oak, Burma.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's guests in the online shopping and local supply store, or the retail market, in order to reduce the sales volume of foodstuffs every day.
Chief Executive of Sainsbury, Mike Koop, said that people like the department store on the outlet would come faster because the supermarket is trying to get more services and non-food-frees from Aldiur Lidl.
Sainsbury's hundreds of stores are putting Argos's outpost and two years ago, since it brought both of them together, it has also opened up a number of stores, indicating that the sale of the rental goods has been promoted and the soda has been made more profitable.
Supermarket had failed last attempt to re-market butt and farm products.
Sainsbury's worked with Boots in the early 2000s, but had to end this joint business in its supermarket in the distribution of drug stores.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold Selesio, the owner of Lloyds Farms, to 281 stores in the farm business at 125 million pounds, followed by a new strategy.
It stated that Lloyds will play a major role in the plan, together with La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in addition to the best Lazary scanner brands.
The commercial director of Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hex, said: "We have changed the shape of our boot products in order to enhance the environment for our customers.
In particular, we have also joined trained fellow workers who will help us to give advice.
We have made our brand circle from the needs and attractive environments of every person, and convenient places, which means that we have reached the attractive destination of the bet products that challenge the old way of buying."
Peter Jones declared 'disagreement' on the separation of Willi Willubi from the 11 million pounds.
To focus on its new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, when the TV spokesperson Holley Biluby decided to separate himself from 11 million pounds for the lifestyle brand business of Dragons Den, Peter Jones.
Bilubi doesn't have time for his homeowner and accessory brand True.
A comparison of the two companies was made with the Brand Goop of Guinea's Paltro.
This 37-year-old Morninger announced that Instagram would be separated.
Holly Biluby finally separated himself from the company of the lifestyle brand with Dragons Den's Star Peter Jones, so that he could focus on his new best contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources have learned that when TV's Golden Girl on Tuesday, Marlo, at the headquarter of Jones's headquarters in Binghamshire, admitted that she was leaving her new soda -- worth 1.5 million pounds -- then Jones expressed indignation at it, which means that now there is not enough time for them to give home and access to the brand True.
The comparison of the company was being compared to the Brand Goop of Guinea's Paltro and was considering double the estimated 11 million pounds given by Willubi.
Thirty-seven-seven-year-old Willubi announced on Instagram that she was leaving True, then Jones left Britain to go to his holyde home.
One source said: "Truly was ever the top in the priorities of the movement.
It was believed to be his long-term future, with which the brand was about to move forward in the next few decades.
And his commandment, and they did it unto every man that was bound with this business.
What happened on Tuesday, no one could believe this, was very near to begin.
Marlo's headquarters is filled with items for sale."
Experts believe that the UK's richest star could damage the company to several million because it has become more involved in products such as clothing and household products, and the possibility of this is being overcome can also be slow to begin.
Also, it can end a long friendship.
Three of the sons of Bilubi and Dan Baldwin's husband, Jones and his wife, have been very close to the cape since the last ten years.
Willubi joined the Cap in 2016 with True and connected it as 52-year-old Jones Cherman in March.
Baldwin's TV production is 40 percent of the vacationers and Jones' share.
Bilubi is now the brand ambassador of M&S and will be placed in the position of Ant McParterlin to host I'm A Celebrity's I'm A Celebrity.
One of Jonah’s relatives said to him at night, “We do not want to talk about their business.”
Serious news 'and then we agreed'
He was laughing at them, he said news media would be commenting on them, some people would view it as a "national task" and the North Korean leader would be more positive.
Why has President Trump abandoned so much?
Trump reported his appearance in "News Anchor" Voys.
"I didn't give up anyone."
He said that after his first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim was in the second meeting, a major step was taken to free North Korea by Trump in the first meeting.
However, terrorism has been halted.
After more than three months of the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top political Rei Yongho told the world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not waiting for the "consistent response" of the U.S.
He said that the U.S. has continued to pressure to maintain restrictions instead.
Their hopeful attitude was seen in the Thrup's railway talk.
They said, “We are engaged in good relations with North Korea.”
"We were going to fight North Korea.
Which would kill millions.
Now our relationship is better.'
He said that their efforts to improve relationships with Kim have led to positive results - including the completion of the rocket tests, the release of prisoners, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
Also, in talking about relationships with Kim, they defended their unusual viewpoint.
Alerting clearly to the crowd before him, Trump said, "It's very easy to remain in the position of the president, but 10,000 people outside the country are trying to join this area, we'll have about 200 people to stop them."
An island was devastated by tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia, hundreds of people died.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they did not need it.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population is dying, no national injury has been declared, as well as a condition for international aid.
Mr. Sombu said, "In some situations, unfortunately, it was clear to them that they were not asking for international help, so it became a little more challenging."
However, Seve de Childron traveled to Palou together with a team, but it has not yet been established that foreign workers can come here to help.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Djaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials were taking the position of Palu, were watching whether or not they would be allowed to contribute to international agencies' assistance efforts.
Looking at such situations coming to Indonesia, it seemed that the country is not being prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters are designed for people suffering from tsunamis in the 1980s, they are not like those on other seas.
The warning of tsunami in Palu has been reduced in the siren, no matter how damaging the warning may be, it is likely to increase the risk of life.
Although it is not the best time to go around, it is difficult to go between many islands of Indonesia.
It is always difficult to deal with natural disasters in terms of wages and property.
Earthquake sufferers are being brought to Lombok in a hospital that is far away from Palu, and it takes at least three days to get there from the new disaster site.
President Joko Vidodo created the very bad basic roofs of Indonesia for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to make roads and railways better.
However, the loss of the administration of Mr. Joko has caused the loss of the fund because the next year is going to be a choice again.
There is also a pressure on the media in Indonesia on Mr. Joko, where the members of the Muslim Party have made religious thinking more intolerant.
Over a thousand died, and ten thousand were left homeless; for men of war, with bows, arrows, and other weapons of war, were fighting in the streets.

Cromwell's statue recently became the most famous monument in front of the statue, again described in 'history'
It will be a model justice for the destruction of many of England's adherents to their cultural and religious cultures.
However, the Cromwell Society reported on Mr. Creek's suggestion as "stupid" and "try to rewriting history".
The Cheerman John Goldsmith of the Crimean Society said: "In the current debate on the removal of the statues, there was full hope that the image of Oliver Cromwell would be made of the Palles of Westminster.
No command was given for the symbol of the English Civil War, nor did Cromwell make it.
It may be wrong that in the last century, Cromwell had abandoned his father Thomas for his work.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorrocroft, the best representation of Cromwell is the 19th century's thought and a part of the history of an image that many people still consider to be worthy of praise.
The Sande Telegraph told Mr. Goldsmith: "The honor of Cromwell is shared by many people, which may be why most people still know them as the guardian of foreign pressure in the affairs of the late 19th century.
However, they are considered to be absolutely correct, historically the subject of debate.
It is evident that since the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, our nation has been developing, and the image of Chrome has become a personal identity in which there is a glimpse of the division.
Their availability as Lord Protector is commendable and memorable."

According to Madrid, the population of October 1 is increasing tension in free-thinking areas for a year, but different-thinking people in Catalonia were losing their lives.
Votors chose a very good method of self-reliance, although there were few people who opposed the distinction.
The officials of Catalonia reported that about 1,000 people were injured last year when the police were trying to stop people from moving forward on the site's polling stations.
The freedom-supported groups stopped there on Friday to help the National Police to stop the demonstration.
The display was promoted, but he had to be forced to make a different decision.
The Electrical Narcyssus Terminus had joined his wife in protesting, he said they were not seeing any possibility of being free from Catalonia.
"Our best year was last year.
I've seen my father-in-law cheerfully, but it seems we've been caught now," he said.
Even after a small victory in the regional elections in December last year, the independence supporters of Catalonia fought to maintain influence with several of its famous leaders this year, whether it was in publicizing itself or anti-Semitism, waiting for its role to be repressed for an ongoing proclamation of organizational and independence.
The 42-year-old Mechanical Joan Puig, who recorded opposition to his phone for police assistance, said that the conflict between politicians on both sides had been halted.
He said, "This has become very stressful."
On Saturday, Orol Junquers, one of the nine leaders in the pre-Trail prison in Catalonia, announced that they would fight in European elections next year.
He said, "As a hopeful candidate, fighting European elections is the best way to return to the people's technological values and condemn the return that we have seen in the Spanish government.

Manga beats Livingstone against Rangers from 1-0.
The first round of Dolly Menga assured Livingstone's victory
Livingston, a fast-forwarding manager of the Brox Club, warned Rangers that Stephen Gerard had to take the responsibility of his second loss on March 18th.
The strike of Dolly Menga made the distance that the side movement of the non-Hiberian side of the match with Hiberian.
The side of Gerard's side was a step away from winning the mayor's championship, and next Sunday he'll face the leaders' hearts that are behind eight points.
Earlier, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, in the last month, the main Koch Holt is winning the six-games division by bringing the main Koch Miler.
Livingstone failed to show the widget its game
Long before scored, Holt's team had to move forward, as well as, as a result of their great game, Rangers had a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but he left behind the shot, and then Alan Lithgo was able to stay on his best efforts only so that he could complete the shot in the head of Craig's helmet.
Hosts had an opportunity to play against Rangers, they knew they could put the visor on set ps in trouble.
And that's why he got a big round.
Rangers found a free-circuit, and Livingston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked to set up Manga, who scored a touch and scored from the boxing center.
On that stage, Rangers had strengthened their position, but the home defense was wrong and the bullet was taken back to a considerable extent,
This pattern was also going to the port of Port, although Alfredo Morelos insisted that he be buried.
Scott Pittmann's shot at Rangers's Golliper Alan McGregor stopped his feet and Lithog took the game completely off the other Livingstone.
In the Livingstone Box, the cross was constantly coming and going round, while two panels were applied after the challenge of the halkette, one of which included a Glen Midleton and the other handball.
Review of the 'ordinary round' of Livingstone
BBC Scotland's alsadeir Lumont was included in Tony Magaroni Erina
Livingston's extraordinary performance and results.
For anyone, they were better, they have continued to increase expectations on this growing tract.
Their way of play and personality has been amazingly replaced by top-floit since they got back, but the most famous Holt way in which they have redesigned the team since their arrival.
There were many great players.
Captain Halket was a great player, and they served in a wonderful way, while Mega took Conner Goldson and who put the World behind him.
Although, there was little to learn in Rangers.
Like a great show they've done under Gerard many times, they were less than their standard.
Their final ball was low - only once they could cut their home side open - and it was like some weekend calls for rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Welcome to Erdogan's joint in Cologne

The police prevented 25,000 people from meeting in front of the church, speaking of security reasons, but many supporters flocked to the surrounding places to see their president.
Hundreds of exhibitors who opposed Erdogan, some of whom were Kurds, also objected to the decision of the German government to welcome them to Erdogan's nests and to welcome them to the country.

The storm is dangerous because of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas can be useful)
The situation has become a threat in hot-water areas, but it is likely that it will impact the remaining capacity of the storm in the coming week, Dart Southwest, which has made it more difficult to catch up.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service announced that the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, along with South-West Arizona and East Nevada, have high expectations in southern California and Utah.
The rain that came on Monday night was expected to come out in the afternoon from all the Phoenixes.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted, "Just after 1950, ten hot-air cycles of Phoenix have maintained a hot-air storm or an emergency situation!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the storm Azed border."
Recently, the National Ukrainian Center model has estimated that 2 to 4 inches may rain in the Arizona Mongol Rim, and that there is also an expectation of 6 inches.
With Central Rockies and Great Basin, there is a chance of rain from 1 to 2 inches in other parts of the Southwest, as well as the hope of 4 inches in.
The rains of Rosa can be seen outside of the stormy fields, for it is dry.
Although the rain has become a very serious issue, the drought has now become a state of drought in the south-west, making it possible to benefit more from the rain.
According to the U.S. Route Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's area is too dry, the second highest level is dry," said the weather.com report.

Trump told the young man that he was angry with the democratic party
In a train from West Virginia, Trump reported, "The young girl is a person who has refused to give up the ruthless and humiliating policies of the Democratic Party."
Trump says that the anger of the Democratic Party during the naming process is the result of the kwanwong's concern.
On Thursday, Kwanogha gave the Congress a ransom for the fact that Christine Blass Ford accused them of having persecuted the youth of Ford many decades ago, while giving the ransom, Kwangha has strongly and emotionally completely rejected this.
Ford also testified about the charges during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday: "The people of America saw the quality and courage of the youth on that day."
To a group of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "To vote against the young man is to vote against a person who is the most powerful legislator of our time, he can confirm the law and judge with the actual record of the public.
Speaking of the importance of the Republican Non-Republic in medieval elections, the president referred to the name of Kwanagha.
"Now only five weeks have passed, than the choice that is most important to our lives.
I'm not part of it, but I'm part of it," he said.

A senior partner of Joppa told CNN that the first reasoning from the Senate in Kwanwagh's name would begin on Friday.
Earthquakes in Indonesia, hundreds of people dying from tsunamis, are increasing the number of deaths
On Saturday, the authorities told us that when a huge earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Salvador, there were high tides in the sea and at least 384 people died.
On Friday, a feast was held on the beach of the city of Palu, where hundreds gathered, after midnight, when six feet (18 ft) high waves rose, destroyed the site, causing many to die and all around them to be burned.
Sunami 7.5 came after the earthquake.
In a briefing in Jakarta, Indonesia's News Agency spokesperson Sutopo Sugarho told Sugarho, "When the tsunami hit, people in the middle of the day were engaged in their activities and were not in a state of emergency and were arrested in it."
Ugroho said, "Sunami wasn't just the cause of people's death, but it dragged cars, logos, and houses into the ground, and went to the open sea at 800 km (497 miles per hour) before attacking the sea.
He said that some people would climb up on the trees to save themselves from the tsunami.
16,700 people were expelled from the 24 centers of Palu.
The pictures from the aviation agency posted by the airline showed that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the bridges have turned and collapsed, and a museum is surrounded by water.
And it came to pass on the sabbath, that there was a hindering of the city on the stones.
2.4 million people in the area have experienced the ongoing earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Association and Application of Technology (BPTT) said in a statement that the potential of energy from a large earthquake to come on Friday was nearly 200 times greater than that of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said that a long, narrow valley can increase the size of the city's landscape on the edge of the city.
Ugroho explained in detail that it was "very terrible" and that it caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
He reported that some people's corpses had been captured in the shelters of dozens of buildings, and 540 people were injured in it, while 29 people have not been found.
Ugroho reported that the area near the center of the earthquake is likely to be much more kenyan and damage than 300 kilometres (190 miles) in the mountain area.
Ugroho reported that the communication system in the mountains was "completely damaged".
In a statement, Red Cross reported that more than 300,000 people were staying here and that its workers and volunteers were traveling to affected areas.
It says, "It's a painful event before, but it can be even more terrible."
On Saturday, the Agency examined why the information was not given earlier, although the authorities indicated that the warning was to be issued but the waves had already come.
A person secretly made some videos and posted on social media, which shows that the situation on the top floor of the building was noiseing a person down the street, and a warning can be given.
Within a few minutes, there was a lot of water going out of the middle, and the buildings and cars were drawn with them.
Reuters was not able to authenticate Futez immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a problem in Palu, and the lines of communication were cut, making it difficult to combine rescue efforts for the authorities.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have begun sending Kargo flights, authorities have indicated that people still need to be removed and that other needs must be met with food.
Airport of the city is only reopened for relief efforts and will be closed in October.
President Joko Vidodo was going to do Sunday during the exit centers in Palu.
In Indonesia, the number of people who died because of my mother's death has increased by more than 800.
It's terrible.
Mr. Dossebah explained that the workers of the World Vigen in Donggal tried to make Palu safe, the workers were making a tabloid shelter in their office courtyard, and they saw the damage in their eyes.
They said, "He certainly knows that many of the houses are destroyed."
It's terrible.
The relief teams began to bring relief supplies seriously, some complained that special-purpose relief workers were being denied access to the palace.
According to Indonesia's rules, wealth, equipment and workers can only be accepted when the declaration of the disaster area is made as a national disaster area.
But it's not done yet.
Alia Aryani, a professor of Red Cross in Indonesia, said, "This damage is still on the level of the country."
"That's right, after the government says it's a national disaster, so we can include international aid workers in the rescue work, but it hasn't happened yet."
On Friday, after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami, people whose friends and family members had not met in Palu expected their favorite miracles to be found, just as natural disasters happen.
It was found on Saturday that a little boy was trapped in Cever.
The band drew a woman out of the tent on Sunday, and her child was caught in the tent.
Koch Gandon Subando, of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, trained two Asian game paragliders to identify the missing people, who were dedicated to it from the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
The M.D. was also among the people who were trapped in Roa Roa Hotel with their students.
He said, "I've been emotionally depressed as a top level in the paragliding field too."
Mr. Gandon said that shortly after the news of Roa Roa Hotel's collapse, the paragliding community began its work, sending messages to Palu competitors participating in the Festival through WhatsApp.
However, their message only shows a grey mark, not a blue sign.
They said, "I think the messengers have not come to the people."

Rapper Lake West is going to change its name and keep it.
On Saturday, he tweeted on Twitter about the change, saying: "Their name will be the Queen West."
The 41-year-old West has named it for some time and will release it in June to their eighth album for Monique.
This is being changed in their presence in the Night Live on Saturday, where they expect to start their new album series.
Shoe's creator said he removed Singer Aryana Grande from the show who refused to participate in the show for "emotional reasons".
As well as reducing its current professional name, the West had already stated that they had a religious significance for the word.
Speaking to the radio host Big Boy on the title of his album this year, the West said, "I agree that the word 'je' has been used several times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'."
"That's why I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
This word is taken from the queen, which means only one, which is the only - it represents our good, our evil, our evil, our evil, everything.
The album shows who we are.
They're one of the many famous rappers who change their name.
There are also many names of Cyncombus, such as Pf Daddy, P.D.D., or D.D., but this year they have their names and brother-in-laws when they announce their names.
An old friend of the West, JJ-Zed (JAY-Z) has also replaced his name with hyphen and large characters or without it.
AMELO, in Mexico, swore not to use the army against civilians
After 50 years of the country's death penalty against students, Mexican President Andres Manual Lopez Obredor used this sworn military force for foreign citizens.
On Saturday at Teltelko Plaza, Lopez Obredor promised that "military force will never be used to pressure Mexicans."
On October 2, 1968, the peaceful movement on the beach was shot by soldiers, which killed more than 300 people, at the time when the movement of Vamapthi students was spreading throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obredor has promised to help Mexico's young people, they will give their students monthly contributions and open up more and more free government universities.
He said that the lack of opportunities for unemployment and education include those who criminalize young people.
The U.S. flag to double the value given for the I.I.
Google, Microsoft and Apple have reduced inputs and AI's business Kai-fu Lee said, as China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, so the US should double the cost of research in this area.
After many actions by the U.S. government, the AI has commented, they also said that there is a lack of operational AI policy in the U.S.
In the meantime, last year China launched a plan: it aims to reach the AI import number 1 by 2030.
Lee said, "To double the AI's search budget is a good start, to look at all other countries, so the US is behind this issue, and we're trying to achieve the next success of the AI."
In a witness this week, Lee from CNBC said, "doubleding the fan can be a double possibility that the next major availability of the AI will be in the U.S.."
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Huton Mifflin Harcourt, Cio of Sinovavers, one of China's best AIA companies, is a member of Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mailen University had worked on an A.I. system that left U.S. top-ranking Othelo player far behind, and later they were appointed president of Microsoft Research in Executive and China Branch of Google.
Lee explained the technical capabilities of the last U.S. government, which included the challenges related to the robots of the Defense Edward Research Project Agency, and said who will be the next government that will recognize the next remote.
Lee explained that U.S. researchers often face many difficulties in getting government help.
Lee said, "It's not Chinese to remove academic leaders, it's a corporate."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed Duggages from University to work on AI.
Lee explained that immigration can help the U.S. through changes in the immigration policy.
He said, "I'm counting on Green Card to get permission to hack into the A.I."
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched its NEXT generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee said, "The National Nuclear Science Foundation of China provides financial contributions to researchers from the National Science Institute, but the quality of teaching in China is not very good.
In the beginning of this year, the U.S. Defense Department opened a joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, whose goal is to include industry and students' participants, and White House announced the creation of a Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DRAP launched a first-named AE Next, which referred to 2 billion dollars inflows.
For NSF, it is now more than 100 million dollars per year in the AIA survey.
Meanwhile, U.S. law made that the requirement to make a National Security Commission for Artifical Intelligence would be ignored for months.
Macedonians voted that the country’s name will be changed
On Sunday, Macedonian people voted to replace the country with "Republic of North Macedonia", or not, a task that will resolve the old Greek-led dispute, which has led to the banning of its membership in the European Union and the NATO.
There is also a region in Greece called Macedonia, which is said to have its northern neighbor's name on its territory, with two names for the same Diary and already included in NATO and the European Union.
Both governments divided by the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said that changing the name of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of many people living in Slavic.
President George Evanov said that they would not vote in the community and dissociate the campaign, they doubted that at least 50 per cent of the vote would be valid for this vote.
The question will be written on the polling ballot: "Do you approve of the agreement with Greece for the membership of NATO and Eu."
Prime Minister Zoran Zev told the supporters associated with the change of the name of Sath that it is necessary to become a member of bodies such as eu and NATO for Macedonia, which is one of the countries that have emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
The 79-year-old Olivera Georgizewska, who lives in Skopje, said, "Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for young people in Macedonia, so they can live in the shadow of the Jehu because it means we all have a safe life."
Although it is legally not being stressed, most members of the parliament say they will work according to voting results to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name in the constitution.
The State Elegation Commission says there was no information on irregularities until 1 a.m.
Although, when the last election was held in 2016, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent, with 66 percent registered thinkers voting.
A 62-year-old speaker in the capital, Skopje, Gojo Tanevski said, "I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe."
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zew went to Macedonia to vote in order to change the name of the country with his wife Zorika and his son Dossiko, to join the country's NATO and the European Union on 30 September, 2018 in Stromika, Macedonia.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kvardirkov, who lived in Skopje, was preparing a small-scale stage and was putting courses in front of those who were opposed to this vote.
Kwaderkov said, "We must subscribe to NATO and Jehu, but we want to be included in it, not by any agreement."
"Our country is poor, but we are also proud.
If they don't want us to sign up for Macedonia, there's nothing we can do, we can join other countries like China and Russia, and we can join Euro-Asia."
Prime Minister Zev said that getting membership in NATO would make Macedonia a very important investment, which is more than 20 per cent of unemployment.
After casting his vote, Zev said, "I think there will be a lot more positive voting because we agree to connect more than 80 percent of our citizens with Eu and NATO."
He said "yes" would result in "the confirmation of our future."
Last Monday, the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia announced that 30 to 43 percent of the votes in the poll will take place.
On Sunday, the rest of the TVs of Macedonia show that 57 percent of the people are planning to vote.
Of these, 70 percent agree to do so.
More than 50 percent of voting is necessary to succeed.
If voting fails, the policy of the Western Government, which will take place in May last year, will be seriously affected.
See: Sergio Eguro of Manchester City forced the entire Briton to defend himself.
On Saturday, Sergio Eguro and Shem Sterling, at this stadium in Manchester City, England, made enough defenses against Britain to win the Manchester City 2-0.
Eguro, funnyly, made his rounds easy in the 65th minute.
Argentina's striker was transferred to Midfield in the early days.
As they went down to the open field, they defended three British players.
Then Eguro found himself surrounded by four birds.
They pushed a player who defends before moving forward from the corner of the Breton Box.
Then, looking for Sterling, they sent one to their left.
In a box, English Forward used his first touch to give back to Eguero, Eguero used his left boot to beat Matthew Ryan in Britton's head, and the ball went right out of their nets.
City Manager Peep Gardiola told the reporter, "There have been some problems in Eguaro's feet that he's worried about."
"We talked about their game 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were about to destroy them all."
However, it was because of Sterling that led to the initial benefit of Sky Blues at the meeting of Prime Minister League.
In the 29th minute, he scored.
In that game, Aguro found a ball duplicity in the area of Britton.
They took the ball from the left of Laroy Sen.
Sen touched something before sending away the best-playing Sterling.
Just before playing the game, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
On Tuesday at 12:55 B.C.E., in the Spanish League Group Play, the winner of Hoffenheim will be in the Rhine-Neckar-Erena of Germany.
Toys against Rockys want to beat him
After the discussion with the Nationals ended, there was no major reason to insist on another start.
However, the always competing skater is expected to make a big score against Colorado Rocky on Sunday, but the only chance for Rocky is that he has won the game with Los Angeles Dogers in the Enel West.
On Friday night, winning from 5-2 on Nationals, Rocky got a wild card slot, but they are still looking for the first device title.
"Well, we're not getting a very good game, but at least we can play to know that the environment of the crowd and the other team Denver might be the highest level game I'll face this year.
Why don't I take part in that game?"
Nationals still have to tell about the starter for Sunday, but it's coming to hear that in such a situation, Caesar can be included.
Shazer, who played for his 34th start, took a shot at the Bulgarian session on Thursday and was arrested on Sunday at his normal.
Wright Hander of Washington stayed in 220 2/3 of this cyan with 2.53 ERA and 300 strokes 18-7.
Thrump rails in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the Republican Non-Republic in the Middle Term Election, the president briefed Brett Kwanwagha on the situation surrounding her Supreme Court.
"All the work we've done will be on the dice in November.
It's only been five weeks for the most important choice of our lives.
They said, “This is a great choice – I am not part of it, but I am part of it – because I fight for all the great hopes.”
Trump added, "You can look at this very terrible group of democrats, you can see all the things that are still happening.
In addition, they're trying to use other essential tools to power, which you know is useless and useless.
They do not care about who is in charge of the matter, but they want to have control over them. We will not allow them to do so."
He said democracy's campaign is to "distort and impede".
They said, “You will see what happened in the last four days, when you saw the wrath of the Democrat, and how evil they were!”
They refer to the Senate Judicial Committee as Democratic Sen. Diane named Feinstein, whose performance was highly praised by observers.
"Remember his answer?
Have you lost the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for the thing -- the body language was really bad -- the bad body language I saw for the first time."
Working is no longer a Broad Church.
It is not fitting for those who say what is in their hearts.
When my local party members voted to elect me, it was very surprising to me.
Finally, I am the newest among the workers who have lost a lot of importance - we can't say all of our thoughts.
This is also where my fellow soldier John Ryan was, because he too had voiced for insanity.
In my case, the sensor mission challenged me for inconsistency with Jeremy Corbin.
Gimmedarana had similar problems at the heart of the Economic Policy, at national security, in Europe, as well as at the level of V Yong and Mac, on which Jeremy's top leaders did not agree.
For the Notingham East Lab Meeting, it was said on Friday, "We want everything to be included in the meeting and it's profitable."
During my eight years as a local lab MP, I saw that the same was true of Friede Night GC meeting.
Unfortunately, today there is no agreement at many meetings and there is a promise that the politics of "the merciful and the poor" is actually forgotten here too.
It is clear that if the views in the lab party are different, they are not contradicted and it is decided for every thought that this party is eligible for leadership.
Shortly after Jeremy's leadership began here, for whom I had previously thought they had political views like me, they began to expect me to return to my words and work on the positions I could never agree with, whether it was national security or the single market of Jehu.
Whenever I raise my voice to the public -- and it doesn't really make any difference what I said -- I get to see bad words on social media, it's being pointed at, the politics of the center is being reproached, and I'm told that I'm not eligible for a lab party.
Besides, he's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more selective than some of my associates because my comments are linked to politics.
I know how to do business, and I'm dedicated to partners who always face sexual or tribal abuse, but don't give up shouting.
In today's political age, there are several disappointing aspects, one of which is how to make abuse levels normal.
Last week Jeremy Corbin claimed that it is important to promote the culture of intolerance for the lab party.
The fact is that we have now not remained a Broad Church and that every proposal of "faith" or the party's election role has been very low.
In the last two years, a number of people advised me and asked me to keep quiet and not talk more, and then I said, "I'll be okay."
But, I didn't come into politics for it.
32 years ago, when I was connected to a school as a student, I was encouraged to oppose the Dochar government, and I was told to leave my school's vast room completely, I asked people to provide the best public services they needed most - whether as a local parliament or as a government minister.
I never hid any of my politics, along with the politics of the previous election.
There is no one in the Notingham East who has any doubt about my position of policy and any area that is inconceivable with my current leadership.
I would like to say to all those who have promoted the proposal on Friday that when the country is moving towards the Brexit that harms our public services, I do not understand my time to demonstrate my honesty for the lab party and to waste my energy.
But, in fact, I have a message that's not for the Notingham Momentum, it's for my supporters, whether they're labs or not: I'm proud of the fact that I'm serving you and I promise that no kind of unusual effort in my work can produce any kind of shock or political interference, I'm only interested in things that you're all in.

Iron 38 - 17 Melrose: Reach the unrestrained iron top
Two recent efforts can have an impact on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that the Air Tenant's prime minister was the winner of the best entertainment match.
Now they're only on top of a ten-independent side table.
Finally, their defense was better, they found as many good opportunities as they could, which led home team to move forward and gave Koch Peter Mordecai the chance to be happy.
They said: "We have tested our game in full, and we are still in the wrong, and I am one of those who rejoice."
Robin Kristtie of Melrose said: "His credit goes to the Iron, who lost their opportunity as much as possible."
The efforts made by Grant Anderson at the 14th minute led Frazier Klimo to face the air, but the Scottish player Rory Hughes was given an elo card, which offered Melrose the opportunity to score, and Jason Baggen suffered a very difficult effort.
With the help of the Haf-time just before Penalt, Klimo increased the ice, rolled and then tried to merge the ice from 17-5 to 17-5 for the break.
But Melrose was better at the port, and Patrick Anderson's effort turned Baggot into a ball, which reduced Levi's five points.
After that, Ruridha Nott was severely injured, causing the game to be stopped, they had been dragged, and after the game began, the iron moved forward and tried by Stafford MacDonald, who replaced Klimo into the ball.
At that time, Captain Blair McFarson of the Iron Team had received his next card, and then Melrose gave him an extra man Bruce Calvin that failed to kill him.
Although the host team was behind, and when Struen Hechinson had received a card from the Palatine Line-out because of Bill Ball's climo, McFarson pushed the iron forward.
After sending Flander Henry away from David Armstrong's boxing kite and the fifth attempt on home side, Klimo changed it into a round, as they could when the game began again.
The stars of the game are still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Star Ford Kern of the game is still looking for a way to go to the Hospitality Index, a while ago they had learned that they were selected to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old Jack is connected to George's famous B.B.C. show, in which they work writing, and along with a long time ago, Comrade Partners Greg Hemfil's actuation.
Both reported that the coming nine Sires will have their final Sires in the world, and it seems that they are planning what to do with Kirnan after Craigling.
On the basis of the official record list, they are the directors of the Adriftmore Limited.
Akter refused to comment on the story, but the source of a Scottish season indicated that Karen Glasgo was trying to connect to a large restaurant trade.
'Our authority on the sea': Land-related Bolivia hopes to reopen the way for court peace
Army-Navik La Paz is swimming on large scale in the Nival Headquarter.
The Osian-Blue flag is being flagged on government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the United States, there's a gap between the Nausena Bas and the Nausena Bas: "We have authority over the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
In the 19th century, Bolivia still has a tendency to find its land in a terrible conflict with land - they want to reclaim their address in the Pacific Ocean.
Now they hope that decades ago they will be able to regain their Bolivian land, because it is waiting for October 1st to come before the International Court of Justice after five years of reflection.
Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Kalazila said, "Bolivia now has a lot of enthusiasm, there is a sense of unity and peace, and there is a positive result of the hope of the people here."
Many of the people of Bolivia will see the great decision of Izaj on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the decision of Hega court will be on the side of Bolivia -- which has been talking for decades -- Chile is forced to return to the land of Bolivia in the sea by means of conversation.
The best president of Bolivia, Ivo Morales, who is going to face a controversial challenge in the next year's election, has also been able to do this on Monday.
They said in the latter part of August: Peace be on us!
However, some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's best interests -- and if the decision is in its best interests, there will be plenty of conditions.
The United Nations Office in the Netherlands does not have the right to recognise Chilean territory, and it has determined that the likely results of the news will not be determined.
In the International Court of Justice, Chile's expert Paze Zeret explained that the decision of Izze will come six months after the last talk, which indicates that the case was not "complicated".
In addition, it seems different from the conditions of Bolivia, over the past four years, that it can return to the old situation.
Jaret said, "The point of access to the sea is blocked by the current government of Bolivia."
He suggested that Moralese's controversial speech has ended Chile's remaining well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk about some conditions, but this time it will be very difficult to talk.
Since 1962, the ambassadors of both countries have not been living in each other's country.
President Edward Rodríguez Wellze, former representative of Bolivia in Hege, has denied that the court's decision was unusually quick.
He said that Monday would be "a better opportunity for Bolivia to open the way for new relations with Chile" and that it would be "a chance to end 139 years' misunderstandings on a mutual basis".
Kalazila has accused Morales - still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America - of politics on the maritime problem.
They said, ‘Bolivia will never be able to make a return to its land until it is at sea.’
"The decision is to know what we had to do in the past."
North Korea said nuclear surveillance will not be stopped until it trusts America.
Foreign Minister Rei Yong of North Korea said that their nation would not destroy its preacher's bomb until they had trusted in Washington.
On Saturday, Rei gave a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
They said to the United States, "Let him fulfill the promises made at the summit of Singapore among the leaders of other countries."
He noted that the U.S. Secretary Mike Pompio seems to be relaunching the nuclear community more than three months after the promises made in North Korea's Kim Yong Singapore.
Rei said it's the "pipe drama" that would remove North from the bans and U.S. hits to declare the Korean war to be overrun.
The Washington Pyongyang has been warned of the agreement of the major disarmament campaign already under way without the announcement of the Washington Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, it is completely doubtful that Pyongyang nuclear bomb monitoring is serious because they don't want to put the country's security in shock.
The next month, Pompeo Pyongyang is planning to go to the other summits that will be held by Kim-Trup.
In the Paris fashion show, showcases of new design for your nearby high street
If you need to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, you don't need to wait much longer.
Valentino and Thom Brown designed a series of better headviews for their SS19 collection at Runve, which appeared in the famous Paris Fashion Week of special style.
Best useful hats are designed to save from this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creation to show.
The best hat made by Valentino was quite large, it was decorated with wings like the wide brim which had been wrapped around the head of the model.
The watermelon hat, the visceral hat, and the pinapple design hat were made in a very large side accessory, but they are not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thom Brown also showed special design boxes - and can only be used in time for Halloween.
Many colourful faces were surprised to see things like the hunky lecturer.
In one creation, every type of equipment was seen for Scoba Diving, including snowballs and showers, while in the other creation, icecream convalescent design was seen.
Besides, if you've seen a bigger fashion -- you're a counselor.
Those who look at style are expected to be able to quickly access the best collection in the best shops around you.
Very large sized hats will meet with 'La Bomba' design halls, two-foot wide bridges of the Stra Hot Rihana and all the people from Emily Ratazkovski.
The cold label behind the best effective hat looked pretty beautiful, was shown with the second creation on social media - showing the model of the swimming suit on the bag between the street.
Bernt Orange Rafia Bag Rafia Fring was treated with a white leather handle, which was the best attraction of the SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week at River Jaquems.
Fascist Celibrite Luke Armitage said to Effemel: 'I hope that the coming heat will be big hot and will soon be in the stores between the bags -- because the designers have been so impressed by this that it will be difficult to ignore the large-scale accessory.'
John Edward: Language skills are needed for foreign citizens
Scotland's private school is looking at the track record of the best education, and since 2018 it has continued to provide better testing results that strengthen personal and collective success in games, art, music and other community efforts.
Over 30,000 students in the whole of Scotland are associated with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCEs), which are trying to serve their students and stakeholders best in their leadership.
The goal of private schools is to prepare students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting foreign citizens.
As an implementation sector that can create and implement school texts, we see that modern languages in schools continue to be chosen as a choice of a famous and wanted subject.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone who understands the language, you become better for him.
If you speak with him in his tongue, his speech will please you.”
When we want to make a relationship and trust people from other countries, we think we can trust English more.
In the recent year's trial results, we can see that languages with the highest rates in private schools are the highest in the League table.
68% of them are students who have received the highest grade A in foreign languages.
The data collected by 74 CSI students can be seen in 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in the Mediterranean language, while 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in the German language, 69 percent of students received the French language, and 63 percent received the Spanish grade A.
This shows that Scotland’s private school is working in foreign languages that will provide important skills for children and young people who will need them in the future.
Languages are now included in the text of private schools as an alternative subject and in other things, such as STSM topics (scientific, industrial, engineering and mathematics).
The UK Commission for Implementation and Skills in 2014 found that the New Yorkers fought hard enough to recruit workers on empty terms, with 17 per cent of them expecting less language skills.
Therefore, young people are forced to become more language skills to prepare for their future career.
Due to the most potential opportunities for the language, these skills are needed to work anywhere in the world.
No choice for careers, if people have learned another language, such skills will benefit them in the future.
If you're able to talk to foreign people directly, you'll get ahead of yourself in the competition because you're a multilingual person.
In 2013, more than 4,000 British adults took part in all of YouGov, according to which 75 percent did not speak enough in a foreign language, and only French was the only language to be spoken by 15 percent and that was the only language to reach a double figure.
That is why today children need to be taught the language.
Knowing a number of languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will allow children to find the best opportunity to find the right newspaper.
Languages taught at every school in Scotland will be different.
Many schools will also focus on more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages whose view is towards 2020 and which are considered the most important for the Yukon, for example, Madrid or Japan.
Even if your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose the language in private schools and they will also find staff who are experts in this area.
Scotland's private school is dedicated to providing an environment of education that will prepare children for the future and provide them with the necessary skills for success that they can advance in the future.
The fact that language learning in the country is essential for the global business environment is not yet a waste of time, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be accepted as "international communication skills".
This option will continue to be provided by private schools to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done.
John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday in San Diego, Lebron began to be part of the lacquer
Now the moment of waiting for the fans of LeBron James is coming to an end because they are soon to play their first match for Los Angeles Lakes.
Luke Walton of Leakers has announced that James has been chosen as Precise Opener to play against Denver Nagets on Sunday in San Diego.
But, how many minutes will they play it still remains to be determined.
"They'll play at least one minute and more, 48 minutes."
The lecturer Mike Trudell tweeted that James could play for a limited time.
After the start of this week's study, six games from James Leckers were asked about their plans for Precisean Schedule.
He said, "I don't need to be prepared for Preciseen's game at this stage of my career."
Thrump's Ray in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
In Welling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump played a lot of ball for the campaign tonight.
The following week, Trump has set up five and a series of rails, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote specified in your election for an appointment on top of the Supreme Court's empty term, the tromp's target needs to help for the mid-term election because it is expected to leave the Congress's control over the vote in November when the vote is counted.
In West Virginia, when will the night trumpet be held today, and how will you view it online?
On Saturday, 29 September, 2018, seven days of ET was scheduled for the trip to Weling, West Virginia.
You can see the railing online of the drums in West Virginia via Live Stream on YouTube.
The Supreme Court's expected Brett Kwangah may be able to give a thrift speech at the hearing of this week, the conviction of the expected Senate vote for a week has been suspended during the investigation of the crime against the young man.
However, the main objective of this stressful environment of the rails is to help the Republic cope with the elections in November.
According to Reuters, President Trump said during the campaign, "The goal of these five rails next week is to encourage volunteers and supporters to protect and increase their forbidden interests in the Senate and in the decades to come."
According to Reuters, the speaker who was removed from the tromp campaign said, "Congratulation control has become so important for their agenda that the president will only travel to the states where our campaign will be very busy.
According to West Virginia Metro News, "Viling's Vasbanko Erina can be brought to the attention of the supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania by tonight's radio."
The second time last week will be the second time the Trump has traveled to West Virginia, they received more than 40 per cent in 2016.
Tromps are coming forward to help support Patrick Morris, who is behind all of the West Virginia Republican Senate.
According to Reuters, political scientist Simon Hender of the West Virginia University said, "If the attempt to increase Morris in the election is going to be made by the president, it is not a good sign for them."
Reader Cup 2018: Team USA showed a willingness to fight so that the hopes of living on top of the Sande Singles can be maintained
After three consecutive sessions, Saturday afternoon at the fourth session will be the result of what is going to happen in this rider cup.
The amount of time passed between players in a row is completely new, but when the player exits and the player is trusted, it cannot be assumed in such contests.
What, then, will they now say about the timing?
As the day went by, Jordan Spitt said, "They had a six-point increase that's now four, so I think we're going to have to increase our speed a little bit."
As a matter of fact, Europe benefited and took 12 points in the game and moved forward from four points.
According to Speithe, Americans think they have a few opportunities and have a lot to encourage, not only from the Speithe's form but also from the Justin Thomas form, who played together all day and both got three of their points from their game.
It's deadly to everyone, and it's the best in the game.
As their game progressed, the people excitedly played strong strings, when they and Thomas went two and a half points down, they played four al-Squares.
Because of their plugs, their team came to the 15th position with the same screen, sort that tells you that you don't believe the American team out of it.
He said, "You've got a good game, and you've got to make sure you win."
That's what all the players who are out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, there are only two players who have scored more than Speithe and Thomas, whose names are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitewood, who are making a new history in the Reader Cup.
The different styles of Europe, but the best Cup has got four points in four and the next.
Saturday afternoon was "Molywood" by the only couple who didn't shoot a bow, but they stayed away from the bow before Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at nine o'clock in the morning.
On Sunday, the way to get the run and the run was found in this strong crowd and this strong crowd like the biting players, and there was no player who could change the possible victory of the European team so that it would be the first sunset of the Golf Nation compared to Flitewood or Molinary.
Well, let's both be different in different ways.
Although, Europe's shame is being said a long time ago.
Baba Travel and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Hiro Sergio Garsia in Forball in the morning, when their partner was made with Alex Norren.
In front of nine Dougs, Spain and Sweden, they never made it here before.
Although, on Sunday, there was no one to help you get to your hall.
Forball and Forsam were very good because the interaction between the peering was much better, they advised that they did not need advice and are well-known for changing politics.
As a team, Europe has played a great deal and has grown significantly in the last day, but this forum session has also shown that the team has the ability to cope with USS, which is particularly questionable in the stateside.
Europe increased 10-6 on the last day of the Reader Cup
On Saturday, Europe will benefit from 10-6 forballs and forsom matches that increase in United States on the final day of the Reader Cup.
The best couple Tommy Fleetwood and Franco Molinari have increased the Tiger Woods fighting with two winnings so that they can move their match from four points of the Golf National.
Two years ago, Tomas Bejorn, in Heseltine, was arrested for misfired by the American side in the European South Morning Forum, which led to an increase of 3-1 in Syria.
U.S. showed more resistance in Forsam winning in two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
To maintain the triumph of traffic, the side of Jim Furick needs eight points in the 12 single match on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first ever European stopover to win four points, while Molinary and Molywood started with the "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, they are the second pair that wins its first four points in the history of the Rider Cup.
After losing Woods and Patrick Ried in Forball, they again lost the best players Woods and the US Ruki Braison Deshambu to lose the best display from 5 and 4 points.
The Woods that are going ahead with two matches on Saturday showed their best performance, but now they have faced 19 defeats in their 29th match and seventh match in Forball and Forsam.
Justin Roose back to Forble in the rest of the morning with his partner Henrik Stenson back in Forsam, and one of the world's three players, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeka, defeated 2-1.
Although Plagent in the South West of Paris, Brice had no break in Europe.
The main player, Jordan Speithe and Justin Thomas, who won three rounds on Saturday, established benchmarks for the United States.
In Forball, he won 2-1 of Spain's John Reham and Ian Polter and sent Pauls and Rory Mcleroi back to the first two halls with 4-3.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Reader Cup when a team came back from a match that reached the singles, while the necessary side of Furick drew all attention to traffic.
Although, for two days after being a second-best, the counter-attack will happen on Sunday, as if separate from their old game.
North Korea said that saying 'no way' would only remove one party that cannot be trusted
The North Korean Foreign Minister explained that the United Nations continued on Saturday to continue the restrictions that were dependent on its belief in the United States and did not show any way in which the country would only allow itself to monitor nuclear bombs in such circumstances.
Ree Yong Ho said in the Annual General Assembly of the World Body that last year North Korea had many ways of doing something related to "significant positive" such as stopping nuclear bomb and missile testing, destroying the nuclear bomb testing site, and promising not to advance nuclear weapons and nuclear industry.
They said: Nay, but we have not found an answer for it.
"Without trust in the U.S. in any way, there will be no faith in our national security and there will be no way in such situations that we will start the elimination of each other."
While Rei reiterated that the claims made by North Korea are about the "walking" view of Washington, which will gradually benefit North Korea, it is quite clear from their statements that it cannot be abandoned by one party because Pyongyang has already done so.
For the first time in June 12 serving in Singapore, the U.S. President and North Korea’s leader, Rei, at the summit of Kim Jong and Donald Tromp, agreed to work in the direction of “the elimination of Korean customs”, while Tromp promised North Korea’s security guarantee.
North Korea is calling for the Korean war to end officially in 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang should leave his nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed the call to end severe international restrictions on North Korea.
Rei said, "The U.S. has focused first on elimination and has increased the pressure on restrictions so that he can achieve his goal firmly, and also, he has also been affected by the "declaration of the end of war."
"The curtain can bend us, such an idea is a pipe dream of people who are ignoring us.
But the truth is that our trust is constantly diminishing by ban."
Rei did not discuss the plan of the second summit between Kim and Trump, they said the U.S. leader had opened the sights of the United Nations last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings held in the last five months between Kim and South Korea's leader Mun Jain, saying, "If South Korea is a party to this problem of elimination and the US is not, the elimination of Korean customs will not be part of such an violence."
Still, Rei's speech was very different from last year's speech when he said about the United Nations National Assembly that the "Raket Man" mission, which was called the "M. Evil President" tramp, was unconcerned with the North Korean rocket.
In this year's United Necessary, North Korea's threat of "full destruction" was praised for its courage to be removed, but said that there is still much work to be done and that the ban will continue until North Korea is eradicated.
On Wednesday, Trump told them that he had no time limit for it, "If it takes two years, three years, or five years, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be awarded a reward for the steps taken by the UN Security Council.
Although the Secretary of State of the U.S. Secretary Mike Pompey told the U.N. Security Council: "The prohibition of the Security Council should continue until we realize that without any failure we are completely, ultimately and properly depleting."
Security Council has extended its restrictions on North Korea to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme in 2006.
Pompeii met with Rei at the UN General Assembly, and then told them that they would be reorganized for another summit next month.
Pompeii has already made three trips to North Korea this year, but their last trip has not improved.
They returned from Pyongyang in July and said that they had moved forward, only within a few hours North Korea denounced them for "Gangster-like demands".
In this month's summit, North Korea intends to destroy the missile site, and if United States adopts a "sweet solution", it will also destroy the nuclear environment.
He told them Kim had promised them a "good deal", they were asking for security to take a hit in Singapore and they moved forward to make a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard's students are training enough for a relaxing job
The Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all of its entrants who want to find more and more relaxation when they are faced with increasing research in the macho culture through the caffeine-innovator 'al-nitters'.
The number of students in a university often has no choice when such normal things come to give themselves a rest.
At Harvard Medical School, Professor of Sleep Medicine and Brigham and Dr. Charles Keissler of Vimas Hospital have developed a course that they believe is the first of their kind in the U.S.
After talking about the low impact of sleep during education, they decided to start this course.
He told The Telegraph, 'I got a girl at the end of the year, and he said, 'Why do I say this every time I go to the next class next year?'
He said, "No one has told him about the meaning of my sleep. I was worried about it."
For the first time this year, students will learn how important the good practice of gold is in reading-writing and athletics, in addition to improving their general health.
Executive Director Paul Barrera of Health Services at Harvard Medical School, Professor of Mentality and University of Health, explained that students do not sleep enough every week for which the University decided to start this course.
An interactive task series has been included in the course of running for hours.
In one section, there will be an image of a Dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books to tell what will impact on caffeine and light, and to tell what effect it has on the athletic performance from sleep loss, as well as about the importance of gold in the daytime.
In the second section, the participants will be told that a lack of sleep can increase the risk of stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the interactive icon campus will be shown, and participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
Professor Zesler said, "We know that this will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they should have information about this -- just as smoking has information about the health effects of smoking.'
He said that there is still a culture of pride on "all night reading," which means growing pressure on modern technology and students that they need less gold, which has become a growing problem.
Whether you sleep well enough or not, making sure it's like the students' 'secret weapons', they can cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, they said -- it also saves the weight from falling because their brains from sleep loss are always thinking about hunger that keeps them hungry.
The 19-year-old Ramand of California, who studied chemical and physical biology, built Professor Jessler's Help Course, completed his last year's class in Harvard.
He said they woke up because of the course and were inspired by the campus-wide course.
In the future, they hope that all postgraduate students will be required to complete this course before they join the competition organization.
Proo Jesler suggested that students should consider setting alarms before gold, as well as determining when to wake them, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of the 'Blue Light' that can put on them more Sardinian than sleep problems.
Livingston's Rangers 1 - 0: Menga turned against Gerard
Because of Dolly Manga's strike, Rangers had to face another challenge in the match, the 1-0 winner of Levinston's victory was put on the wrong side of Steven Gerard.
In February, after winning 4-1 in St. Johnston, Hebro Side was looking for their first win, but Gary Holt's team encouraged Gerard as a manager for the second round, so that the Leader Hearts of the Landbrox Primeship could be expelled with eight points.
Before Haf-time, Mega took a strike for seven minutes and then never found a chance to match the line-up shirt of Rangers.
Although Rangers have now fallen into rankings and have reached six places, Livingston has reached third place and is behind only Hebrew due to theball difference.
In addition, when the object is clearly thrown on the other side of the object, the game may be more disturbing than the loss of the head of the Linsman Calum Spence.
The eight changes to the Garard side gave the last ice to go to the semifinals of the Betfried Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was included in the same book 11 that took one point of the last week's heart, and the bird team was worried about each turn by the way they drifted.
Rangers could win the match, but Livingstone played better than them.
When Manga first sent Scott Pittman to Eln McGregor's ball, they should only have given him a two-minute time, but Midfielder missed this great opportunity.
In the DDP, Kegan Jacobs, when Free-Kick, went to Captain Craig's hatchet, but at Back Post, their defensive partner Alan Lithgo could only use a stable wide range.
Rangers got control, but they trusted them more than they trusted in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly experienced that they had to place a panel on Quartet-over Mark because they and Steven Loles were stuck together, but reportedly Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on the target in the First-Haf, but took the previous Ibra's ballchip to confront the Lsana Colebi head and the TV Oves strike in Asia.
Although, in the 34th minute, life's open run of the game could go against, but no one can deny that they are the only ones responsible for this graph.
The best player in the ranger DP could not reach Jacob.
When Dickon Gallagher passed Scott Robinson to the ball, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson had kept him calm to cook for Simple Finnish.
When Gerard swooped at Callibel for Ryan Kent and swooped through the window in Morelos, they had broken, but did block their line running well.
However, Livingstone showed the game as much as they could really enjoy the game as they did, they swooped the Long Ball with Lithago and the halkette.
In the final stage, the side of the hold could increase their growth, but before the angle was extended by Lithgov, McGregor stopped James from studying up well.
Rangers called Glen Middleton as an option, they pressed another lat for the panel because they were upset with Jacobs, but Thompson did not let them succeed again.
Almanac: Excavator of the Gezer counter
Now a page of our Sunday Morning calendar: 136 years ago today, 30 September, 1882 and the time after that... the day that the future scientist Johannes Wilhem was born in Germany.
Gezer invented a device that was later known as Gezer counter in order to detect and measure radio integrity.
Gezer counter science is one of the main foundations, it has become the main foundation of pop culture, as well as, in 1950, a film on it became "Bells of Coronado", in which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were acting for the first time:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geezer counter used to detect radioreligious mines such as Uranus.
After starting these calls, you can definitely hear the effects of hidden terrorists on the radio industry."
Evans: "Come on, it's definitely popping up now!"
"Wes" Gezer's death in 1945, at the time they were 63 years old.
However, because of their invention, their name is still alive.

The cancer's new tag can 'see' the bad cells of the defense system and end them
Guides the defense system to identify harmful cells during treatment
Using this method, a patient’s defense cells can be removed and replaced in the laboratory
Then, they can 'see' the common protein for several cancers and then pull it out again.
There are encouraging results in different types of cancer patients in a trailer for the treatment.
A woman was criticized, who was able to see her bad cells in the defense system, and then found that her dembugrancy cancer has been eliminated for more than 18 months.
This method allows the protection of the cells of a patient in the laboratory to be removed and replaced so that they can "see" the common protein found in several cancers called HER2, and then re-emerge the cells.
In Bethesda, Maryland, U.S. National Cancer Institute Professor J. Brzofski said: "Our results show that this is very encouraging."
Proo Brzofski said that the HER2 causes "many types of cancer to develop", including breast, dembugrancy, pheasants, and colorectal cancer.
It is useful to extract the protective cells of the patients and to identify the cancer cells "instruct them" in a treatment of some kind of leukemia.
Following its presence, Connie West rejected the old controversial talk of Trump on MAG Hat.
It's not okay.
After Cane West's best performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would become their government in 2020 too, he denounced the studio during the night of Saturday's live.
After his third song evening performance, in which he had put on Mac America's Great Cap, he protested against the Democrat and insisted on supporting the tromp.
They said, "That's why I've been talking to a bunch of dumb people and they say, 'Why do you want to like the trumpet? They're the next of kin.
But if I were concerned about Islam, I would have abandoned America for a long time."
SNEL, from the start of the show's Matt Daemon, in which Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Young's hair, is already aware that the Senate Judicial Committee is already examining the complaints of young men's abuses against them by Christian Blaise Forum.
Although none of this has been shown, the Fütez Comedian Chris Rock of the West has uploaded to social media.
It wasn't revealed that Rock was trying to blow the West's laugh with mailing because of the post.
In addition, the West complained to the audience that he was threatened with taking his head beer and going to backstage.
"They threatened me with backstage.
They said, “Do not go to them.”
They threatened me!
They also said that I was trapped in the wrong place," according to Washington agent.
The West said, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" And they also said, "They'll make dances for my Superman Kep, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Love."
In their comments, they mentioned at least twice the viewers and felt shamed by the artists of the SNA, a person in a different report told the public: "The whole studio is completely silent."
Gaika Aryana Grande was called to the West, a few days ago the old Boifrid Rapper Mac Miler of the Aryana Grande died.
The West introduced the song I Love on it to surprise many viewers, wearing a pair of glasses.
The West again met with the head of the Conservative Group Typus Turner, who tweeted: "Thanks to one of the most courageous people: to vote for the people."
But, Tok's host, Karen Hunter tweeted that the West was just there "what he said and what's absolutely amazing."
"But I didn't choose anyone who would take advantage (by buying music or clothing or by supporting my "art") who, in my view, was promoting the wrong idea for my community or saying the wrong thing to my community.
He's free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, Raper tweeted on Twitter that they had changed their name, as well as saying that they were now going to "oppressively west."
They are not the first artists to change their names, but they had previously done the Deeds and Puffy, whose old names were the Pof Deeds and P Deeds.
With them Rapper, the old name of Snoop Doug was Snoop Lion, and the Drogant Prince of Music also changed his name into an icon and then the artist was already known as the Prince.

The Star Kit Herrington of the Game of Thrones raised the question of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for their role as a sword-breathing player in the WBO's Wild Middle Fancie Series Game of Thrones.
However, 31-year-old Actor has questioned the role of Macho Hiro, who said that watching such roles on the screen is often driven by many young boys and they feel that such a difficult task is necessary to gain honor.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit told them that they were aware of "something wrong" and asked how to end the toxic massculinity problem in #MeToo.
Recently, Kit married his 31-year-old fellow artist at Game of Thrones, and they believe they feel 'a lot of strength' to talk about the problem.
They said, "I think I'm pretty strong now -- are we doing something wrong with the Masculinity?"
Are we teaching men to be afflicted with the problems that appear on the screen when they are grown up?
The kit thinks that it may be partly responsible for the toxic masculinity, he thanked its many men's chief character.
He added: 'What is happening and what is taught?
Do young people believe that whatever they are taught on TV and on the street, they have to do something to be a man?
In my view, this has indeed become one of the great questions of our time — how can we change it?
For it is evident that there has been a mistake in the minds of young men.'
In an interview, they also agreed that when the game of Thrones comes back at the end of the next heat, they will not participate in any of its prequalities or sequences, and they also said that they have programmed a number of 'warfields and horse riding' programs.
As of November, Kit Sam Sheppard will be working in the new series of True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is a baker.
Recently, Exter told them that the best thing that happened to them from Game of Thrones was to meet their wife every day.
He said, “This is what my wife has given me, so I think that she has given me my future, and my life has gone beyond this.”
Rose has played the role of Ygrit, who is a lover of kite in the Amy Award Winning Fantci series.
In June 2018, this couple married a family member in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, 14% of new cases in China have increased
China has announced that 14% of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country have increased.
Health authorities have reported that more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from this disease.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In view of recent changes, most new cases are reported on sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
In a conference in Greece, Chinese health authorities reported that the number of people affected by HIV had become almost zero.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 each year.
The sex of HIV infection caused by the Chinese LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is reported that LGBT is quite different from the people of the community.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the country's rebelliousness.
Because of a number of disease infections, there is insufficient protection for sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, for which everyone has been promised access to HIV.
Maxine Wars rejected the fact that their employees have leaked data from the GPS, they told the word 'dangerous lie' and 'a way to heal'.
U.S. representative Maxine Wars reported a bad report on the charges filed on Saturday, saying one of their employees posted three U.S. Senators' personal information on the Wikipedia pages of Lomecar.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being tested by an ultra-right wing and website.
Vance tweeted on Twitter, "False, lie, and so much hatred."
As stated, the information included the addresses and phone numbers of Senator Linds Graham and two senators Mike Lee and Orin Heech of Utah.
This information was seen on-line by Thursday, who a Capitol Hill had posted, when a person called to the Supreme Court was hearing the Senate panel on charges of Young Crime against Brett Kwanga.
The three senators were asking questions about the young man's information.
Hill says that Gateway Puntit and RedState are known to the Web site of the IP address that identifies the source of the posting person, it was reported that it was connected to the office of Vardis, and a staff member of Varis continued the information.
He said, “This is a slander, an evil lie, and a lie.”
"No one of my employees -- whose identity, personal information and security are being put into custody because of these false charges -- was not responsible for any kind of breach of this information.
This is an exemplary slander and a false lie.
Wears was soon posted online for the cleaning of the cleaning process, which included the press secretary of the former White House.
Flecher wrote, "The reason for this rejection is anger."
"It is known that their personality is not like being a member of Congress.
When a man is accused of such things, they shall not be angry.
They shouldn't be rebels.
They should not question the man who accused them.
They should be quiet and patient."
It seemed that compared to the response of the Flecher Wars, the judge was insulting the Democrats, who accused the young man of being very angry when he heard the rumors.
The Republican Umar Novaro also tweeted his thoughts on Twitter to lose the exchange in the Middle Term Election.
And they used to tweet, "That is a great thing, if it be the truth."
In his statement, Wars reported that their office had warned the proper authorities and law enforcement units for these fraud claims.
They said: "We shall certainly be told whether the guilty will be declared righteous or not, and whether they will be held accountable for what they have done in the least, or whether they will be of those who are in a worse position for what they do."
Johnny English Strikes Again’s review of the Josué’s invention by Rowan Atkinson was not considered to be more demanding
From the British point of view any new film shows the importance of the Brexit in a traditional way and it seems to have been applied to this version of Johnny English's action-comed Spouse Frenchie, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Are we going to blame ourselves on the matter of how we definitely think we can talk about the new export opportunity of the nation?
At any rate, the Pope and the Lord Face-in-Office have his license to re-create the impenetrable things - which are more famous than anything else than his name, he is a huge comical creation for areas where non-English people live.
They're definitely the Daphth Secret Agent who managed to show Mr. Bein's Dash Closso a little bit in Smuthy Glamer, despite his strange hanong, and there's a doll for the crew who contributed a single note to the career of Fire Theme Tune in London's 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
They are basically travelers and are the International Man Atkins of Secret, whose role was forgotten in the Berkecard TV advertisements.
This new JE output only gets to see one or two good signals.
I liked Johnny English enough to go to a Helicopter wearing a Caucasian Medieval suit and show rotor Blade on his helmet.
Physical comedy on screen is a sort of trap for Atkinson, but the laugh came very low and seemed strange-like, especially 007 and Mission No.
Smile comes as if it's not for comedy ages, but for children, and Johnny English's strange misunderstandings aren't exactly patient with me, and I've preferred beins more in Atkinson's silent film.
The most important thing is now that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
The most secret network of British judges has been hacked by a cyber-hicker, identified by all the British agents on this network that could affect the agent's work - it's a painful event for Kevin Elden.
This is the final support for the excellent and very troubled prime minister, they are already struggling with many political and ill-loved problems: this Quasi-Teresa character can be well-founded by Emma Thompson, but the script is not too hard to work on this script.
His secret counsellors told him that he had arranged for all the work to be done, and that he should bring to him a man who had been appointed.
This meant that Johnny English would have to fight himself, who now has a school master in a passport institute, but what an intruder operator should be doing on this, apart from record: it has some good stories, as well as reading English at the Rock-Type Academy School by Jasus.
English has been sent back to the Emergency Whitehall for briefing, and Ben Miler again has been associated with their very old-fashioned side boff.
Boff's married, he's been trying to be a Pandubbi commander, his role is in Jolly-Hocky-Stix, in which Vicki Paperdine has not been found.
Therefore, Batman and Robin find some serious mistakes in the secret service of his Majesty when they face Ophelia Boletto in a beautiful film by Olga Kruelenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of his kerismetic technical arbiter, who claims he has a solution to the computer problems of Britain: sinner Jason Walta took over the role of Jack Lace.
English and Bug Farsial High-Jinx start their Odyssus: they set fire to a French restaurant working as a windmill; they march through Volta's majestic ship; and English activates the entire arrogance when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to use Volta's interior.
For that last sequence, every film is definitely pulled, but yet it's just and entertaining, the whole movie has plenty of fun for kids.
Right-Aid middle level.
Also, as I saw in the other Johnny English films, in this film I didn't understand that Rowan Atkins in the British film industry should be given a role that is really due to their talents?
Leber has denied that he is planning to work only four days a week for British people, but the money will meet for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Leber Party is considering becoming a popularist plan, which will allow British citizens to work only four days a week - but will be paid for five days.
According to the party, the company's owner wants to give the workers part of the survivor's survival through Artifical Intelligence (AI) to get them an extra day off.
This will give the worker a three-day leave in a week - but they can still get the same amount.
The authors say that this idea will remain 'big' with the economic agenda of the party and it is a plan to benefit workers.
Trades is being promoted four days a week by the Union Congress in order to benefit from the changed economy.
From The Sunday Times, a senior employee of the Leber Party said: 'The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
'This won't happen all night, but it's a four-day job worth a week, which is a fair bill of the economic rebalancing party's view in favour of the entire industrial policy of the party's employees.
During the 2017 general election campaign, the four-day Green Party promising the week will not be the first party to support this idea.
However, this desire is currently not fully supported by the Leber Party.
A spokesperson for the Leber Party said: 'The four-day work is not a weekly party policy and the party is not thinking about it.'
Shado Chancellor John McDonald used a working assembly last week to present his views on the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined that the use of 'face-free managers' and 'unsubstances' should be restored to power in the farms.
Shado Chancellor's plans also mean that current water companies can't get their entire share back because the lab government can't 'cut' on the basis of what's said wrong.
They also confirmed the plan to establish a ten-percent ownership plan for private sector companies to join company boards and to provide private sector firms for employees, which can receive an annual profit of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy's 60-minutes, tells us if the FBI's testing of Kevin could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavena has delayed their names in the Supreme Court in the last sentence for at least one week, and the question arises whether Burrow's conclusions have helped a Republican senator to recover his support.
In a witness broadcast on Sunday, the "60 minutes" communicator Scott Pelle asked the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether there was a possibility that the FBI could find something that would move them to change their mind.
Canada saw more clearly than its co-worker in South Carolina.
"I think so, yes," said Kennedy.
"I said I spoke to the judge in the hearing.
After this happened, when the charge came before them, I called them, and asked, 'Did you do this?'
Indeed, they were certain [in faith].
Although, Graham's vote, it seemed, was a line of stone.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavena and it would require an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Brett strongly refused," Graham added, referring to Christine Blassy ford.
And he could not justify what they had named.
It's 36 years old.
I can see no change."
What is the Global Sitting Festival, and has it diminished in poverty?
This Saturday will be hosted by the Global Sitting Festival, which is an annual music program with a number of powerful stars, and as powerful as this mission; ending the world's poverty.
In its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lone at the Global Sitting Festival in the Central Park, not only to the joy of Janet Jackson, Cardie B, and Sean Mandes, but also to raise awareness of the real goals of the programme of eradicating poverty by 2030.
In 2012, the Global Sitting Festival, an international support group, is an extension of the Global Power Project, which is expected to increase the number of people actively fighting it and end poverty.
For the program to get no paycheck tickets (i.e. if you are not ready to pay for VIP tickets), those going to the concert will need to be volunteers to help create awareness of their target, to email a world leader, to call a number of tasks, or to perform "activities" in other ways.
But how successful is the Global Sitting in the next 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it the right way to encourage people to act through the free music program, or is there just another "clicktivism" thing -- people think they're creating a difference by signing online or sending tweets?
Since 2011, Global Sitizen has said that he has "activities" more than 19 million of his supporters by advancing efforts for various goals.
It says that these activities have helped the world leaders to influence the lives of more than $2.25 billion people, which is set at $37 billion, to announce more resistance and fate.
At the beginning of 2018, the group raised 390 objections and announcements from its activities, of which at least $10 billion are already distributive or rich.
The group is expected to have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main resistances include the power of neutrition, a U.K.'s participation of state inputs and activists, who, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the global population, prevents Runda from providing $35 million to help children to develop their full potential.
In London, during a live concert in April 2018, the ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Neutrision said to the crowd, "We can make a record of history with the help of British governments, donors, national governments, and, with the help of people like you, with the help of global citizens."
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities calling for improvements in nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a project called Power of Neutrision, which will reach 5 million women and children with food intervention.
A question often asked on your website is, "Why do you think we can eliminate so much poverty?"
The Global Sitizen replied: "This will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and colourful opposition movements, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.

Russian energy can use nuclear power to create barriers to exports to the United States of America "unbound" - internal energy
According to Washington Examiner, internal secretive Ryan Zinke revealed that with the Middle East, Washington "if necessary" could support US nuclear power to stop Russian energy in American markets.
Zinke accused Russia of working in Syria -- particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government -- of finding new energy markets.
He said, "I think it's because of their presence in the Middle East that they want to justify energy, as they did in southern Europe, Eastern Europe.
And, according to the authority, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure that the seaways remain open, and, if necessary, unblock, so that it can make sure their energy doesn't go to the market," they said.
Jinke was referring to people in the program organized by Consumers Energy Alliance, who call themselves "the voice of energy user" in the United States.
They compared Washington's view to deal with Russia and Iran saying that they are effectively equal.
Referring to Russia as a "a moving fuel industry", he said, "economic options in the case of Iran and Russia are taking advantage of Cambodia, fuel consumption and substitution."
It is reported that the Trump Administration, taking place in Russia, is on the mission to promote its oiled natural gas exports in Europe as the most stable option for European users.
To that extent, the authorities of the US President Donald Trump himself tried to get Germany out of the "unfair" North Stream 2 pipeline project, according to the tromp that made Berlin "the prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has stressed that $11 billion of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the current pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely financial project.
Kremlin's argument is that Washington's extensive opposition to the project is driven only by financial reasons and is an example of undue competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Ric Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe that we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
Germany's opposition to the U.S. Army, which has reaffirmed its opposition to the project.
Germany's Industrial Research Organization, the Federation of German India (BDI) has said to avoid bilateral disagreements between the European Union's energy policy and the EU's energy policy between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between the federation of German India (BDI), Dieter Kmf, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said, "I have a great deal of trouble when a great government intervenes in our energy supply.
The senator of Massachusetts said that Elizabeth Warren 2020 would be "thinking seriously" on the issue of joining the presidential election in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told Saturday that she would "think seriously" on the run of the President's position after the mid-term election.
While in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider taking part in the race.
According to The Hill, they said, "The time has come for the women to go to Washington and join our corrupt government, and it includes a woman on top of it."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the election for presidential appointment."
Warren said during the Town Hall, assuming President Donald Trump, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I'm completely worried about what Donald Trump is finally doing for our system," he said.
Warren, Trump, and their Supreme Court are looking forward to examining Brett Cavena.
Friday on a tweet, Warren said, "Perhaps we need to check the FBI before we can talk."
However, a follow-up survey showed that most Warrens do not think they should fight the 2020 election.
According to Sffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Pole, "possible" thinkers said that the senator should not fight the choice.
Battys supported the fight against this kind of choice.
In particular, previous Governor Daniel Patrick showed more support in the fight against election, where 38 percent supported possible involvement in the election process and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to probably fight election by 2020 include the former president, Bedin and Vermont Senator Burny Sanders.
Biden said they would officially decide until January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Pollin, Donald Trump's train refers to the PTSD of the Pollin
The 26-year-old track Polin spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, they were arrested for domestic violence
In a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he said to the audience, "My son feels that after coming back, I feel sympathy for other families who feel the effects of PTSD and know the damage our soldiers are returning with."
Palin said to his arrester "in the chamber" and said about his son and other serving soldiers, "They come back with a little change, they come back hard, they think it's a privilege for him who has sacrificed his fellow soldiers and aircraft, and all the other members of the army for the country."
According to Dan Bennet, a spokesperson at the Vila Police Department, he was arrested on Monday at Alaska's residence, and was charged with violence against a woman and violence against her family and the use of alcohol.
18 Kingdoms Support the Challenge of New Refugee Policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District are supporting a new U.S. policy of legal challenge that refuses to protect refugees or victims of domestic violence.
NBC News reported that 18 states and the representatives of Zillie have issued a court-martial letter in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenges the policy.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union did not reveal the full name of the air in the Dairy Greece Embassy session in August.
He said his partner "and the sons of his violent group" abused them, but the US authorities refused their request to protect July 20th.
He was taken into exile in Texas.
Greek-supported government lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, as the nations that face widespread violence in the group and domestic violence problems, which create candidates for US refugees in large numbers.
The new U.S. Security Policy reversed a 2014 resolution issued by the non-performing Appeal Board, which allowed refugees who fled from domestic violence to apply for security.
The Attorney General Carl Racine of the District of Colombia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the rule of decades, the federal and international law."
"The federal law expects that justice should be determined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances for all security claims, and that such a restriction violates that principle," the judge said.
Atorni went on to argue in the summary that a policy of denying access to refugees would harm the American economy that it is more likely to become their native and "require labour".
Atorni General Jeff Sessions ordered Abrujan judges not to provide shelter for victims of domestic violence and domestic violence in June.
In his statement on June 11th, Sessions said, "Refugees are available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group."
The shelter was never to reduce all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people are facing every day around the world.
The number of dead in the search for survivors is doubled in the pool’s rescue effort
For the survivors, the situation was too serious.
"It seems extremely stressful," said 35-year-old Rosa Kusuma, comforting the baby who was suffering from breast cancer in the city of Tahas-Nash Palou.
"Every minute brings an embulence to the corpses.
The water is pure and pure.
It was found that they returned to their own dwelling places, and that they brought their merchandise of fire, and that they sought to save all that was found.
7.5 Hundreds were wounded in the earthquake, and hundreds were drowned in the hospital.
Some wounded people, including Dwhi Harris, who were facing a broken back and shoulder, were taken out of the Palu Army hospital, where the patients were being treated openly because of severe earthquakes.
His eyes filled with tears as he felt the shocks of a violent earthquake in his fifth bed room, shared with his wife and daughter.
"We had no time to save ourselves.
I think I was stuck in the wall hole," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as saying that their family was in the city for marriage.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe.’
The US ambassador accused China of "prohibition" by "advertising"
According to the Chinese government newspaper in one U.S. daily, a week after the launch of a four-page commercial, the U.S. ambassador of China accused the U.S. press of broadcasting on Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday, after attempting to press charges against Congress elections by China on 6 November, referred to China's most-selling newspaper - Ten Moines Register, China's Peed Supplement, which rejects the charge.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with US elections, US authorities told Reuters that it was a new step in the effort to pressure China through Washington.
While advertising to promote trade for foreign governments is common, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen them applying marginally to each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that China's trade-related border-shalk Ayova was designed to attack exporters in countries that supported the Republic of Trump's party.
Teri Branstead, governor of the United States and former governor of Iowa, China, said that Binging has hurt US workers, consumers and businesses.
Brandt wrote in the 10 Moines Register on Sunday, saying that China, "Now he's running a preaching campaign in his own free press and doubles that bad guy."
"In its propaganda world, giving the advertisements paid in the Ten Moines Register, China's state-of-the-art speech on freedom and freedom of press is taking advantage of the American culture," Bransted wrote.
"In view of the fact that the Chinese Communist party is in a strong grip, contrary to this, on the newsstand on the side of the street in Beijing, you will have limited unrestricted voices and will not show any proper reflections of the unresolved opinions that Chinese people can have on China's worrying economic cycle," they wrote.
He said, "One of China's main newspapers has failed to make a proposal to publish their article," although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Analysts warned that women are separating thinkers before choosing the Republican Middle Ages with Cavena's defeat,
Since the Supreme Republic is supporting and protecting the hopeful Brett Caven of the Supreme Court facing several charges, the analyst has warned that they will see a response during future medieval elections, especially from women.
Its surrounding feelings are very great, and most republics are already showing on record that they want to move forward with an opinion.
These things cannot be returned," a professor of political science at Maxwell University University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rehr said they suspect that the last minute the pressure will be enough to calm the angry thinkers to test the FBI by Senator Jeff Flock (R-Arizona).
According to a Washington D.C. newspaper, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the MovementOn on Friday said, "Women can't forget what happened tomorrow -- not tomorrow and not November."
On Friday morning, when the Republicans controlling the judicial committee wanted to move forward with the name of the witness of Dr. Christine Blesse Ford, the exhibitors who showed in the Senate's showroom said, "The number is coming!", Mike reported.
A non-governmental analyst, Stu Rothenburg, told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are getting out of the chart."
"People say it's already great; it's true.
But this could be more, especially women from sub-city thinkers and 18-to-29-year-old thinkers, who often do not vote when the president does not like."
Analysts have already said that if the Republican authorities move forward with confirmation, there is a possibility of opposition, as detailed in the charges of Young Oppression against a person named Supreme Court.
According to NBC News, former president Michael Steele of the Republican National Committee said, "The GOP has become a complicated mess."
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or a cabinet vote, it's also related to how the Republic has handled it and how they have dealt with it," the director of the organization's Prioritis USA, Guy Cecil, who is helping democracy in the election, pointed out the news channel.
Although the U.S. is somewhat divided in this case, they seem to believe in whom the Ford and the witness of Cavana, in which most of them were seen taking sides with the Cavana.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in the testimony of the forum either or possibly, while 35 percent said they believed in the cave.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kevin may or may have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by at least another Flemish, Debora Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford took an oath last week and testified to the Senate Judicial Committee that he was beaten by Kevin at the age of 17.

World Wide Web Inquisitive Time Burns-ley has launched a startup that wants to support Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the industrial legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Open Source Platform Solid by Burnsley.
Solid allows users to select where their data are stored and what people will be allowed to access.
In a special witness with the first company, Burns-ley said in a joke that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world workshops".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
App uses Solid to allow people to create their own "interactive online data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-dos, calendars, music libraries and other personal and practical tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available on all one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data storage is that it depends entirely on the user who can access information.
The company calls it "personal enhancement through data".
According to the CEO John Bruces, Inrupt's idea is to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills through the company so that Solid can make everyone available.
Currently, Burns-Li, Bruce, IBM purchased a security platform, some on-staff developers, and Wallier Coders community are involved in the project.
Since this week, industry developers around the world can use tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own revolving app.
Burnsley said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to start all changes, where all their business models will end at night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
On Saturday, in a post published on the Medium, Burns-ley wrote that Inrupt's "mission Solid" must help to protect the integrity and quality of the new web.
In 1994, Burnsley changed the Internet when they established the World Wide Web Consciousism in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burns-Le Net stability has been playing an important role in the debate.
Even when Inrupt launches, Burns-ley World Wide Web Consciousism, Web Foundations and Open Data Institutes will continue to be the organizer and director.
"I am incredibly hopeful for the next century of the web," Burns-ley said.
Bernard Won: The garden of the WW1 Victoria Cross Clarique
During World War I, the only priest of the Victoria Cross, the only church of England, was celebrated in their home city for 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Won won this prize in the attack in Bengaliz and Lehocourt on September 29, 1918.
Although, four days later, they were killed by a sniper and they never knew that they had won the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, the memorial stone was unfurnished by their two gates in Rassden, Northamptonshire.
One of their sons, Michael Vaughn, said that it was "a wonderful sight" that this is being unmistakable 100 years after their grandfather's award.
According to London Gegett, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Von led his battalion in Channel De Saint-Quentin, "between a very heavy core, under heavy bullets and machine guns" in the field of war.
Later, they moved to the firing line and, with the "great strength", led the army-line and captured three pieces before taking the only field-gun.
Only a month before the war ended on October 4, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Won was killed by a German sniper.
72-year-old Michael Vaughn said in his grandfather's office, "Something I know can never be equal to, but we've got a lot to do."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also sacrificed after Praed, led by Brandwood Imperial Uth Band.
Michael Van said that they are "very privileged to play the role in the parade" and he said, "The strength of a real leader is being demonstrated by the support given by many people."
MMA's famous belter 206 was awake all night, but instead they got a pepa pig
Imagine, you've been living all night to watch a 206 baller full of bullets, but you've been out of sight of the main program.
There were 13 matches in the Sán Jos's bill, which included six cards on the main card and was showing live all night on channel 5.
Six o'clock in the morning, just as the Gagard was preparing to face each other and Rory MacDonald, they stopped turning the viewer's pepa into a pepag in the U.K.
They were particularly disappointed when they woke up early in the morning to meet him.
On Twitter, one of the sponsors described changing children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, the top vice president of Belarus, Dave Schwartz, said, "This material was not suitable for 6 hours in the morning, so they had to switch to the children's programming."
""Peppa the Pig," yeah."
President Scott Koker of the Beltar Company said they are going to work on their schedule to include viewers of the U.K.
"I think when I think about replication, I think we might find a solution," Kokar said.
"But there will be six o'clock in the morning and we will not be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this was changed, there was a great multitude of texts coming in, and they were not all right.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you it won't be like that next time.
We're going to limit it to five times -- as we usually do -- and when we tried to deliver a little bit more for the praisers, it was a little bit more.
This is a miserable situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Delhi felt 'no' in the case of work
Ollipic Gothachor Tom Delly says that he was overcome with a sense of humor for all because of his work -- but he was moved to succeed.
24-year-old Delly said she didn't realize until she got to high school saying, "Everyone's not like me."
Speaking on the radio 4 Dart Island disk, presented by Lauren Palerne, he said he talks about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a father, he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
For a long time, the regular presentation of the show, Cursty Young, has taken months off due to illness.
When she showed up as a socialist in the first campaign of Pallarn, Delhi said she was feeling "low" in comparison to everyone because "the love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, “Today’s feelings are like those of others, and they are different. They have given me strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was also "special," he said, so that he wouldn't let anyone down when he finally found out about his work.
Hei-profile LGBT has become the winner of the Olympic Academy twice and has used its presence in national games in Australia to reduce homosexuality from more countries.
He said he spoke openly because he felt lucky when he was able to live without any trouble and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time World Champion said that a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - when he loved him - "I was surprised."
Dale married Oscar the winner, who is 20 years old, but he said the age range was never a point.
"When you're so young," he went to the Olympics at the age of 14 and died of cancer three years after his father's death -- he said that it was difficult to find someone who had been through such a low-age experience.
In June, Father Robert Ree-Dell became the father of a son named Black-Dell, and Delly said that his "full view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all of this would have been 'I need to win my son-in-law'," he said.
"You'll know, there are more things than the Olympic soundtracks.
I'm an Olympic drummer, Robbie."
His son's name is as his father Robert, who died after his death in his early 40 ’ s from brain cancer.
Dale said that their father didn't accept that they were going to die, and what they wanted to know the last time was whether the 2012 London tickets had come to them -- because they wanted to sit in front.
He said, ‘I did not say to them that you will not sit on thrones, Dad.’
He said: I held back their hand until their breath was ended, and they died. Then I went back and I believed that they were not strangers.
The following year, Deli took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the Connie Prize.
"I only knew that this is what I've been dreaming of all my life -- putting the crowd in the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired their first favorite song-stream wife, Heather Smol, who was playing with them during the Olympics and who are still listening to their cries.
Desert Island will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
out-of-format Michaelson from the radar copy of Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set up a record on Sunday when they play their 47th Reader Cup match, but they need to change their form to save it from becoming a faulty metal.
For the 12th time playing in a two-year program for record, Captain Jim Furick threw Michaelson out of the game for the Saturdays and Forsams.
Instead of becoming an attractive center, as they are often being built for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day between the winners and working to improve his playing skills.
The 48-year-old player's title Le Golf has not been a model fit for his career, where those who have not been active for a long time are regularly punished with wrong shots.
And where the course is not as easy, there will be a British Open Campion Franco Molinari in Sunday's new match, who played together with Ruki Tommy Flitewood to win all four matches this week.
If the American players who start four games in the 12 singles can start with a strong start, Michaelson's game can be quite important.
Furick trusted his husband, not that they could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, shook my back and surrounded me in their left hands and said they'll be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He's very confident of himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot in the past to these teams and this week.
I probably didn't plan on playing her two matches.
I had more ideas, but it worked the way we did it and the way we thought we should move forward.
He wants to go forth like everyone else's.
Michaelson will pass the record of Nick Faldo for the most played rider cup matches on Sunday.
This reader can mark the end of a career that has never touched the heights of their personal record.
Michaelson has won 18th, 20th and sevenths, although Furick said his presence brings some interference in the team.
"He's funny, he's violent, he's present, he likes people's jokes, and his presence in the team room is special," they explained.
"I think young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to see.
Who gives nothing but play and amusement.
Europe’s Captain Thomas Byron knows that a great increase can soon be lost
Thomas Byron, the European captain, knows from his experience that the rider’s cup can easily be turned into a much larger one in the last day.
Dan made his first show in Vladerama in March 1997, where a party in the captain of Sev Ballestiros had gained five points on the Americans, but with the victory of 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2, with the lowest margin, only reaching the finish line.
"We keep reminding ourselves that we had a great lead in Volderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we were lost, and in Volderrama, we just won," Beorn said to the 2018 class on Friday 5-3 and tomorrow after seeing 10-6 increases in the National.
So history will show me and all the people on the team that it's not over.
You'll be all right tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It won't end until you get the score on the board.
We have a target, and he's trying to win this traffic and that's where to keep focus.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are well aware that the biggest players in the world are standing on the other side."
Byron added that their players showed how difficult golf courses were: "I will never get ahead of myself in this.
It's a different tough time tomorrow.
Tomorrow's personal demonstration will go forward, and it's a different thing.
It's good to go there with the partner when things are going all right, but when you go out there personally, your ability is fully tested as a golfer.
This is a message which you need to pass on to the players to show their greatest tomorrow.
Now you leave your companion behind, and he will have to know, and he will have to show you his best way."
By contrast, the opposite Jim Furick would be looking for a better personal display for his players, which he had made as a partner, the exception was Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who had received three out of four.
Because of Europe's "miracles in Medina" before losing, because of being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, the Furic itself is on both sides of those great last days' response."
"I remember every joke," they answered in answer to the question of how Captain Ben Cranshaw had handled his players the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you've seen in Brooklyn, as you've seen in Medina.
When this speed is reciprocal, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
And We have made the line to be straight with Us, and We have joined the people with them, and you know that We are going to perform a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the response attack with Rory Maclero in the summit, where Paul Cassie, Justin Roose, John Reem, Tommy Flitewood and Ian Polter are the top half of the other European order.
"I had created their group in this order because I think it covers everyone," Byron said about his only choice.
Germany’s New Warfare Retired
In 2014, the new German Nausana wargates were to be commissioned to change the era-affected peace-keeping wargates, but local media reported that due to criminal systems and rapid growth, at least until next year, the local media reported.
According to a military speaker, the "Reinland-Pfles" commission, which is the main port of the New Warden-Wurtemburg-category, has now been stopped until the first half of 2019.
Port was supposed to be part of Nasena in 2014, but the post-distributive issues affected the success of the major project.
The four Baden-Wurtemburg ships were ordered back in 2007 to be replaced by the once-affected Bremen-Category Warports.
It is understood that they will provide powerful tops, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles with a combination of some steel techniques such as low radar, aperture and sound.
Other important features include long-term storage time - from the Soviet ports to the last two years.
Although, the constant delay means that the state-of-the-art wargate - which will allow Germany to have the opportunity for a foreign power project - will be delayed until the time of entry into service, Di Zin commented.
In the meantime, F125 wargates were good butts last year, when German Nosena officially refused to commission the pot and returned to Bloom and Vose Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that Nasena returned a ship to the ship's creator after the delivery.
Many people knew the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted several important "software and hardware crimes", which would nullify the warship when the war mission was launched.
Software deficits were particularly important because the Budden-Wurtmburg-category ships will be operated by a group of 120 sailors -- which is only half the population of the old Bremen-category.
In addition, the fact that the ship is more dramaticly weightier that reduces its display and limits the ability to add future upgrades.
The "Rinland-Pfles" of 7,000 tons is thought to be twice the same category of ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to guilty hardware, the value of the whole project tag - including driver team training - is becoming a point.
This is said to have reached €2.2 billion from the beginning to €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problem of new wargates that have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings is tying the moral strength of Germany.
In the beginning of this year, the chief of the German Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the ships in Nasena are actually "stirring-capable".
The authorities said that in time this issue became serious, because old ships were removed from service, but no replacement ships were available.
He said that none of the wargates in Baden-Württemberg were able to join the Navy.
He's listening to the secret life of national trust bulbs.
The aim of the new research carried out in an aesthetic of the Scottish Islands is to explain how fireflies use natural sight in their victims for food.
It is hoped that the outcome will bring new light to the behaviour of the foreign tourists and help guide future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists from the National Trust in Scotland will follow the Dobington Fireworks in the Invere Garden of Western Ross with the Soprano Pypistrals.
Special recorders will be placed at the main locations around the end to track the activities of light bulbs in the entire weather.
NHS workers and volunteers will also use the mobile detectors managed by NHS.
The operator of all recording audio analyzes the version of the Batt call and shows what nations are doing.
The map and reports of natural habitats will be prepared for an extensive visualization of their behaviour.
Rob Dover, the nature conservation consultant of NTS, hopes that the results will determine which area of natural life is most important for light bulbs and how they are used by every nation.
This information will help to determine the benefits of management tasks such as the construction of grass fields and how to keep Woodlands well for lighthouses and other associated nations.
In Scotland and throughout the U.S., there has been a lot of collapse in the last century in the lighthouse population.
They are at risk of development and development, which affect birds' arrests and harms natural habitats.
The water turbine and the light system can also create shocks, because some chemical treatments of the fluteper and the building material, as well as the attack by native billiards, can be dangerous.
The bulbs are not really blind.
Though their sacrifice is a custom, their ear is more profitable than their eyes, when it comes to catch the prey.
They use an improved eco-location technique to infuse faults and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of 76,000 hectares of land across the country for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important mornings, and 76,000 hectares of land, takes the skin very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly monitor and sometimes rescue bird traps.
The organisation has established the first and only dedicated Bat Reservoir of Scotland in Dumfrez and the third state of Galove, Scotland, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag states.
Estet Manager David Thompson says Estet is a better place for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for the lightning," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural habitats.
But there's a lot of things about light bulbs that are still unknown, so what we're doing here and in other areas will help us to understand what things they need to waste."
They stress the importance of the examination of the firefight before putting in the process, because it is possible that the loss of the maternally healthy disease could destroy 400 women and children, possibly destroying the entire local population.
It is not lawful to kill, to scourge, or to trouble, or to destroy, the coals of fire.
The Scottish official Elizabeth Fürrell of the Bat Convention has encouraged the people to move forward to help.
They said, “We have a great deal of knowledge for our sake, and we do not know how many of our people are doing.”
Ronaldo dismissed the charges of rape, while the lawyers tried the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called their rape statements "false news" by saying that people use their name to "declar the message".
Their lawyer, German newspaper, will judge Der Spigel, who published the charges.
At Portugal and Juants Forward in 2009, Catherine Mayorga was charged with rape by the American woman at the Las Vegas Hotel.
Der Spigel reported in a report on Friday that he reportedly paid the woman $375.000 to remain silent about the event.
After reporting on the statements, Ronaldo told the reports "false news" to the people who followed him in the Instagram Live Video.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is the Farji news," the five-time bull D'or Victory said in the camera.
"They want to preach themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be popular with me, but this is part of their work.
I'm a happy person and everything's okay," the player said funny.
Ronaldo's lawyer, Der Spigel, is preparing a trial for those charges, according to Reuters, who said "probably illegal reporting in the field of confidentiality".
Lawyer Christian Shertz said that the player "will be looking for moral damage according to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the said event took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palm Hotel of Las Vegas and Casino.
According to papers from Nevada's Clarke County Jila Court, after meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they reportedly raped him.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told them that they were "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" was disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that this couple had had sex, but had mutual consent to it.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her wounds in a hospital, but later agreed to be out of court because she felt "feared by terror" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
According to 34 years old, she is now trying to end this conflict because she has been subjected to torture just after the incident.
At the time of Ronaldo's attack, Manchester United was at the risk of joining Real Madrid, and in the heat, Italian Duggage was awarded €100 million.
Broken: U.K. will be sorry for the loss of the manufacturer
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said that U.K. "will be sorry for Hamesa" if he loses his position as world leader in the creation of a car after a brief.
He said Toyota U.K. told B.B. that if Britain left the European Union, he would temporarily stop production at Derby's office in Burnston.
"We need a drink," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that in the situation of No-Dal Brexit, the effect of the delay may be on the workers.
The Burnston Plant produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90 percent of which were exported to other parts of the European Union.
In Burnston, the director of Toyota, Marvin Cook, said, "I believe that if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory."
Other U.K. car manufacturers will work across the border with Honda, BMW and the Land Rower, with no EU agreement.
For example, BMW says she'll close her miniplant for a month after breakfast in Oxford.
The main concerns according to the car manufacturers are related to the supply sequence in the position of No-Dil Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the basis of "just-in-time", in which the U.K. and the European Union, both of the providers of the mode-to-order cars every 37 minutes.
If March 29th leaves the European Union without a single vessel, there may be a ban on the limit, according to which the industry may reduce delays and resources.
The company said that it would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day's inventory in its D.C. plant, so the production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chess Plan in Theresa for future relations with the European Union "has been calibrated to avoid these tests on a purely limited basis."
"We need a solution. We want a better solution that I think not only can enjoy success at present, but also what is needed to achieve this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
"Not only toota but other manufacturers have found evidence that we should be able to continue it completely, which is setting too successful supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run, warned that the device's competitiveness would be reduced and jobs would eventually run.
Peter Sauvellis, who has been working in Burnston for 24 years and is the organizer of the Unit Association, said that their members are too concerned: "They never return to Bad once in my experience when these jobs are gone.
One government spokesman said, "We have advanced a true and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union."
According to the White House, the tromp meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's debt to the Attorney General, General Rod Rosenstein, is able to hold a high-level meeting "one and a week after", because the Supreme Court's expected Bret Cave continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Agent Robert Muller, who is investigating the potential legal impediments between the Russian elections, the Tromp Assistant and the Russian President.
The tromp debt will extract or will not extract the General, and which threatens the freedom of the mule, the news has warmed the market of Washington's aquifers for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of having a conversation with Trump and removing the president from the 25th investigation.
Rosenstein broke the report.
But on the last Monday they went to the White House among these reports that they were going to prove themselves.
Instead, Thursday was announced a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that they would "not like to remove Rosenstein" but then the Senate Judge's hearing was delayed in the meeting, both of which witnessed a woman who was accused of violence by Kevin and him, Dr. Christine Blassi Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the allegations against Cavana, which resulted in a delay in the execution of the Senate.
I looked at the trunk's press release, Sarah Sanders, on the Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date is not set for this, it may be this week, I can see that all other cases with the Supreme Court may be pushed forward another week.
But we'll see, and I'll always like to update the press."
Some reporters have claimed: Sanders hasn't reported the White House press since 10 September.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing was not a cause of concern for the "realities" of the TV interviewers, although they said, "I don't understand the fact that they're huge."
He then suggested that direct contact be made between Trump and the press.
He said: "The nobles are asking questions like those of other presidents." But without giving any evidence, he said: "We have seen the number."
Briefing will still be, Sanders said, but "If the press has the opportunity to ask directly from the president of the United States, it is better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot, and you've seen us do that in the last few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United Kingdom, he's going to take the news."
When leaving the White House or participating in open sessions, or with a number of people, the drums regularly answer questions at the press conference.
The only press conference is unfortunate.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, with the presence of the journalists, he was uneasy and many times unique.
Healthcare professionals in the European Union in Scotland write about the expectations of a brief
Health Sachiv has written to the workers of the European Union working in the NHS in Scotland with the desire to express their gratitude for the country and to remain after the Brexit.
Gene Freeman MSP sent a letter to the European Union after the U.S.A. for less than six months.
The Scottish government is already reluctant to meet the demands for citizens of the European Union who are working in its ongoing public services.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the Germans, the U.K. and the European Union continue to talk, moving towards the expected decisions in this respect.
But the U.K. government is also advancing its preparations for the possible No-Dal landscape.
I know it's going to be a very uncertain time for you all.
That's why I wanted to repeat how important their contributions are without any regard for the nationality of each staff member.
The European Union, and its colleagues, brings valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health service, as well as benefit the sick and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Early surgery of Christian Abercrombby after a head injury
tennis Mike Organ reported that the tennis state tigers, who suffered loss from Vanderbilt Comodor on Saturday 31-27, lined up with Christian Abercrombie after the head injury.
The chief of the state of Tennessee, Koch Rod Read, told the interlocutors that it had taken a while before the hit Hofftime.
"He came to the edge and just fell there," read said.
Teachers and medical workers placed it on the tractor and brought it back for further evaluations to Avcromby on the sideline.
An official of the state of Tennessee told WSMV Chris Harris in Nashville in Tennessee that Eberdromby Vanderbilt Medical Center had come out of surgery.
Harris said "There is no description of the type/limit of the injury yet" and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercromby, who is Redshort Sophomore, is in his first seat with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game, they scored a total of five on Saturdays, and their sine became a total of 18.
Higher stamp tweets will be taken when purchasing wealth in the UK from foreign buyers
Foreign buyers will be given a high stamp duty when they purchase assets in the UK, which will be used to help homeless people under new tower plans.
This step will undermine the success of the Corbin effort to attract young minds
Extended stamp tweets will be applied to people who are not paying for their work in the UK
The tracker expects it to help the homeless - in a year it will add £ 120 million
Foreign buyers are preparing for a high stamp duty rate at the U.K. on purchase of property - which will be used to help homeless people in Theresa today.
The move is being seen as an effort to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to provide more affordable housing and to identify high-income people who are attracted to the word.
Stamp duty increases in U.K. will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay for what they do, which will be encouraged by the government's efforts to deal with the gold problem.
The publisher - who is in addition to the current stamp duty, in which the purchases of two houses and rentals started two years ago may be up to three percent.
Tracery expects to grow up to £120 million in a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built property is purchased by non-US residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult to walk on the path of home for first-time buyers.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "the city" because there are more foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy, Boris Johnson, has been faced just a few weeks after the call for bribery was made to help more young people build their first home.
They accused large construction firms of wasting land but not using them in the cost of wealth, and asked Britain to leave the cost-effective houses in order to correct the "fate-free" from Messe.
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposed home improvements, including the end of the rental controls and "no-falt" disputes.
They want to give the press more power to build new houses.
Miss Mee said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime minister to restore the British dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means to fix our virtual home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay here, work and create life.
Although it is not true that it is as easy for foreign-based companies with non-British residents as it is to buy homes for working British residents.
The dream of the home is far gone to many people, and the anger of gold is very real in the worst of circumstances."
Jack Ross: 'My last important task is to manage Scotland'
The boss Jack Ross of Sweden says they have to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
42-year-old Scott, the North-East Club, is repeating the challenge of reinvigorating the club, which is now in the third place in the League Forest, and which is three points away from the top.
They had gone to the stadium of light in the heat of last year after leading St. Miren to Scottish Prime Minister.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and that's what it was," Ross told the BBC Sports Sound in Scotland.
"But from childhood I grew up seeing Scotland with my father in Hempeden, and it's always something that brings me back.
This will only happen when I succeed in the management of the club."
As the manager of the borderland, Dick Advocket, David Moys, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kein, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canio are among the former Russians.
East Eloa Athletic Boss says they have no fear of following the names established in such a big club, which had previously rejected the first of the Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I can expect success because I can get this club back to Prime Minister League?"
Because of the design and facilities of this club, it certainly comes into the Prime Minister League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I may see myself here as a success if I can get there."
After spending 15 months in the Cooking Staff of Hearts as a assistant boss in Dubert, Ross's management career has been only three years.
And they helped Eloah out of the third row, and changed St. Mirren into the next session by force of the champions of the champions.
And Ross says they feel more easily compared to the work done during their careers in Clyde, Hartalpool, Falkirk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academy.
In charge of Aloa's position, they said, "This may have been four."
"I really believed that the management was better fit for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did the right thing, did the right thing, and enjoyed the right things.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to get a lot of things on the weekly basis.
I still deal with them in the matter of stress and pressure, but everything seems to be fine in the matter of management.
I always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my old life."

The right time for a pint is Saturday night 5.30, found in the survey
The heat storm has fueled Britain's rivals, but it has put more pressure on the restorative lines.
Pab and once group saw a 2.7-percent increase in sales in July - but the decline in restaurants was 4.8-percent lower than in July.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which wraps up the data, said: "In comparison to the expected participation in the World Cup of Lagatar Smoke and England, July means that the same pattern was followed in June last month, when the peaks were 2.8 percent, except that the rest had to face more difficulties.
In the restaurant trade, 1.8 percent of the turnover fell in June and worsened in July.
Drinkers and bar sold drinks with the strongest display compared to restaurants.
Food-maintained beans also suffered damage to the smoke, although the restaurant is not as dramatic as the operators.
It seems that people wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent for the whole month, while three percent fell in the food business.'
Paul Noumin, Space and Hostile Analyst RSM said: "These results have continued to be seen by us since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or game events on the market outside the house becomes the biggest factor in the sale.
It is no wonder that the restorative groups continued to fight, although the decline of 4.8 per cent per year in sales will be particularly painful, due to ongoing pressure.
The weather of the people of the city was not long for them, and the hour was not long for them; and He will say to them, “Will the heat of the day, which We used to experience, be of great comfort?”
There was a 2.7-percent increase in total sales in pubs and restaurants, with new openings in July, showing a slow pace in the brand roll-out.
The Kaffer Pitch Tracker collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups, with a combined trade of £9 billion, which is displayed with the company's joint venture in the area of pubs, bars and restaurants, and it's an established industry benchmark.
One of the five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one of the five children -- some of whom are under 11 -- has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, an increase in the "Fargie Insta" pages was observed.
The news has increased the doubt that young content is being posted
Twenty percent of girls say they have a "main" to show their parents.
One of the five children - some of whom are under the age of 11 - are making social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, the "Fargie Insta" accounts have been rapidly increased -- a reference to the photo-sharing site installation.
The news has increased the suspicion that young content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a "main" account to show their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenager was in it calling for "to rape me".
Digital Ages U.K. and The Headmasters and Headmasters were found in search of free schools (HMC) that were two-percent profiles of 11 to 18-year-olds, of which half were admitted to keep private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It is a very disturbing thing for many young people to be able to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elliptical Doyle Scottish Athletics Board shall have "Voice for Athletics"
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-functional director at the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
The most beautiful tracks and fields of Scotland are Athletes, and Cheerman Ian Beatty told the players of the game to benefit from their extensive international experience in the past decade.
Betty said, "Scottish, U.K., and the world's Athletics community have a lot of respect and we're sure that the Athletics in Scotland will be useful enough to bring them to board."
He said, "I want to work as an elite voice, and I hope that I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
In addition to its four Olympic sound players, the American, 200 metres in 1996 in Atlanta, and 400 meters in the race, and now the regular BBC, have been unable to run after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I was attacked today.
I'm not going.
Doctors said that it would be time to tell me whether I'd be okay or not and to what extent I could be.
It was a horrendous task, but to be completely healed, to walk again, and to learn to practice speedily today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Compared with the dogs of mothers by the breast - pumping advertisement, online people find disagreements
A breast pump company distributed an online opinion by an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "Brist Bomb" called "the world's first dumb-dressed product," user Tek company Elvie released a new music music video-incentive advertisement, which allows new pump mothers to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance on a song, including some words like, "Yes, I'm breast-feeding myself, but you don't see any smell" and "If you haven't noticed, these are not hairs, these are my breast."
The course continues: "Pop It Out, Pump It Out, I M Feding Dam Bebes, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I M M Mlending May Ladies."
In any case, the advertisement, published on the Facebook page of the company, is the reason for the online dispute.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many said that it presents the "fear" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
They need to be pregnant and breast-feeding just like us, except that their babies are stolen from them within a few days after they were born," one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump is fed with sus-bush inside the Elvie/Middle
Another comment: “For both mother and child there is pain.
But why wouldn't they be used to advertise breast pump for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their children?"
And another one of them said: "What is the matter with you?
Others defended the ad, one of which said they thought the ad was "hasiper."
"I think it's a very good idea.
If I had, I would have buried it.
The pumping makes me feel like I'm a cow.
It's a little weird, but I've seen it the way it is.
One wrote it's a good product."
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement for mothers who pump (mostly in their workplace or in their classroom) and experience as "songs".
It is not an advertisement to promote the dairy industry or a decisive advertisement."
At the end of the video, a group of women said that they were playing with caution in their bra.
The pursuit of this campaign is based on the knowledge that several women who are pumping dust say they feel like they are a cow.
Although the Elvi pump is well hidden, there is no wire or tube in it, and the direct warning goes into a nurse's bra, allows women to go without pumping, grab their children, and even go out.
In Anna Ballerin, participants and Mother, the ECD commented: "Elvi pump is a transformer product that is responsible for a dangerous and magnificent launch.
By drawing a parallel between women and goats, we want to bring salt pumping and its challenges to the spot, showing the sense of freedom in a fun and related way, which will bring new pumps.
It's not the first time Elvy's pumping in the air.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product was shown to be catavowing for designer Martha Jacobschi.
Hundreds of traveling children secretly traveled to a tent camp on Texas border
Even when there was no change in the monthly limit crossings, some of the difficulties were caused by the severe traffic jams and bribes presented by the trunk administration.
Traditionally, most organizers had appointed the residents themselves without the document and were afraid to put their own ability to live in the country ahead of them, claiming to be a child.
The danger increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential organizers and other members of the house would print their fingerprints and share the data again with non-resident authorities.
Last week, a senior official of Matthew Albence, Aperage and Border School, presented evidence to Congress that the Agency had arrested people who had been asked to organize non-natives together.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested were not registered as offenders before.
"Approximately 80 percent of those who are projectors or members of the manager's home are illegal in the country and most of them are criminals.
That's why we keep searching for those people," said Mr. Albens.
Requesting the children to be prepared quickly, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children were required to be brought to court within a month of being arrested instead of 60 days, which was the last standard for the refugees.
Many people appear through videoconference calls instead of presenting their case for legal status before a non-resident judge.
Those who are considered unfit to be released are immediately expelled.
As long as children remain in detention for a long time, it is possible to remain in a state of baccine or despair, which can be seen in a violent desire or run-away attempt, according to the system's report in recent months.
Lawyers or prosecutors said that those cases are taken to high facilities such as Tornillo, where they are ignored by the evidence that the child is fighting.
And they also said that giving the children enough time to be emotionally prepared, or not telling friends to take them to the city of tent, will increase the effort they are already struggling with.
Syria asked the US, French and Turkish military forces to return immediately.
Speaking to the assembly of the United Nations, foreign minister Valid al-Malem also said to return to the refugees of Syria, even to the eighth year of war in the land.
Familiar, who also serve as a deputy prime minister, said: "The foreign forces are illegally dwelling on the land of Syria and will be treated in accordance with it."
"They must return from the war ground immediately and without any condition," they told Simmonli.
Molem stressed that the war is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people have been snatched out of their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this war until we clear all the Syrian territories of all terrorist groups and "a foreign presence".
The United Kingdom has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in the presence of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the land that has been destroyed because of the war.
In the case of refugees, Valm said that conditions were right to return to them, and they were responsible for "the spread of fear of terror" in some Western countries, which moved refugees to stay away.
They said, "We have called the international community and human organizations to facilitate this return."
"They were politicalizing a whole range of human affairs."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is no political conflict between Inad and the alien to end the war.
U.S. politicians say that Idelib makes an opportunity to put a buffer zone in the back of the last major rebellion between Russia and Turkey to put pressure on a recent political conversation.
The Russian-Turkey Dil or Consistency prevented a large-scale Russian-supported Syrian attack, where three million people lived.
Although, he said that there is a clear time limit in the conflict, and he also hoped that the military action force would highlight the battles associated with Al-Qaeda, which will be "removed."
The representative of the United States soon expects the first meeting of a new committee with government and foreign members to prepare the post-war constitution to correct the path to Syria and the election.
Talm laid down certain conditions in the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, which said that the panel's work should be prohibited to "examine the articles of the current Constitution" and to warn against action.

The Elegance House ran like a wave of foreign money in a strong medium.
It was not surprising that in Pennsylvania, 17th century, there had been a wave of money or bribes, which was due to the re-establishment of the Congression, which led to two officials standing in front of the same seat.
Who recently opened the Morca for the Democratic Rap Conner Long in Pittsburgh County, the subcity of the city -- who won their seat in the second district in the past year.
The lamps were also part of another race, the Republican Cath Rothfes, which currently represents the 12th district of the old Pennsylvania, which surrounds each other with the new 17th.
In the case of illegal networking by the former prisons in the Republic of Pennsylvania, maps or maps were redesigned in January after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.
In the new 17th race, the struggle between the main money weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) had reached the economy of the campaign.
The first 18th Congressional elections in Pennsylvania in March resulted in a large-scale victory of the Lamb in Pennsylvania.
That's why the seat was held by the Republican for nearly a decade, and President Donald Trunk won it by 20 points.

To support China in the United States, punish El Salvador, then move back
Politicians pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already approved sowing because of their resistance to Washington.
Mr. Trup met with President Juan Carlos Virela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Tromp Organization's management team expelled the participants.
At the beginning of this month, the head of the department, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama, said in a statement that "Taiwan has not yet accepted the decision" decided to call back the U.S. leaders of the U.S. mission from the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was sentenced to $140 million in 2017, with Narcotics Control, Development and Economic Assistance.
The proposed penalty, which included marking cutbacks and visa restrictions in financial aid, would be painful for Central America and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When internal meetings or meetings were held, the North American and Central American authorities set up a high-level conference, which was seen as a step forward in order to follow up on the grouping or community last year, focusing on security and economic prosperity, which was seen as an effort to prevent people from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, the top administrations made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively ended by considering any punishment or prosecution for El Salvador.
Politicians said that sub-President Mike Pence is now ready to refer to the conference, which has now been scheduled in mid-October.
And three of the Americans came back to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without any hard news or punishment.
For Mr. Bolton, the White House spokesperson for two politicians, including three U.S. officials, refused to comment on the details of the dabbat or debate, which agree to discuss the internal thinking on the condition of not clarifying the name.

The following case may be reported by Robert Mueller on the possible resistance to the trial of Mr. Trunk, of which there is sufficient evidence in the public record.
Also, according to Mr. Mueller's report, they change the direction of their investigation that if Mr. Trup's campaign to attack our elections, Russians will be fighting.
When the Congress comes together, Mr. Traps find themselves responsible in that department, when they prepare themselves to go before the speakers again and perhaps face a jury of their colleagues.
Of course, many if and if I don't mean to suggest or suggest that Mr. Tromp's and not their opponents in Europe are not inseparable.

If Mr. Tramp Dept General General Rod Rosentin, who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's test, what would we do?
Rosentin has been in this situation since last year's paper reported on it, he suggested that he keep the president's record secret and think about their incompatibility to the office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the time's account is not correct.
"If the recently requested Brett contingent's F.B.I. investigation is not complete or impartial - or if he remains firm in the Supreme Court in spite of the accusations of young persecution and false testimony?
And above all, will we contribute to the midterm for the Congress, for which Mr. Troms will be responsible?

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
The authorities reported that on Friday, at least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
After the communication was closed, the rescue officers were unable to obtain any information from Regents, the northern area of Palu, which is near the subcentre of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were expelled in disaster.

There is a population of 299 from the administrative region below the regents, which was 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of the Central Soviet region was to catch and farm fish, especially in the coastal areas of the mountain.
Nickel mining in the region is also very important, but it is focused on the opposite sides of the largest solution in Morovlia.
According to Indonesia's Alpation Agency, Sunami has issued several times in the last 100 years in Palu and the mountains.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed because of tsunamis in the mountains and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, Sunami also signed in the western mountain, where nine people were killed.

Sarah Pelin’s eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Pelin, former Alaska governor and vice president hopeful to attack Sarah Pelin's biggest son.
Vsila, Alaska's 29-year-old Pelin, was arrested on Saturday, according to a report released by Alaska State, in the doubt of domestic violence, to strike and combat domestic violence.
According to the police report, when a woman known to be trying to call the police to report a reported crime, she took the phone from her.
According to KTUU's report, Pelin was sent back to the Mott-so-Protereal Facility and also sentenced to $500 unsecured bonds.

U.S. Attorneys are calling for the death penalty for the cause of the NYC attack
In New York, U.S.A., U.S.A., is calling for the death penalty for Sifulo Zipov, a virtual penalty to be handed over to the government for United States crimes since 1953.
Cyprus, 30 of October, uses a home depot truck to attack a bike on the Western highway in lower Manhattan by cutting off pedestrians and bicycles in October.
According to the intention to request the death penalty in South New York City, in order to properly justify the death penalty, the defendants must prove that Zipov has "consciously" killed eight victims and "consciously" physically injured them."
These two countries are probably sentenced to death according to the court document.
After one week of the attack, a U.S. Grand Jury beat Cyprus out of prison for 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for aiding rockets, which are used by members of the United States in cases of organised crime and in cases of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The activists said that the attack needs to "discover enough planning and previous thoughts", explaining the way in which Zipov resulted in "disgusting, cruel and evil".
"Safluo Habiblivic Zipov injured and damaged the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves Enlor Dekate, Daren Dreck, Aryal Eleg, Aaron Faruki, Aaron Diego Mendoza and Elozandro Pagunko," said the report.
Five of the patients were from Argentina.
The last death sentence on the case in South York City is going on for a decade.
Ulzim Khalid Bran was found guilty of the murder of two drug providers, but ended in September 2009 because of the execution of the Nursing Karavs.
In 1953, the death penalty for Julius and Itel Rosenburg was last heard in the New York Union case, a married couple who were convicted of trying to rape the Soviet Union during the two years before the Cold War.
John Rosenburg was sentenced to death by the electric course on June 19, 1953.
A local resident of Uzbekistan, Cyprus, had no glamour or regret for days or months after the attack, according to the court documents.
The police said he told the investigators that everything he did pleased him.
Zipov told the authorities that he had been moved to attack the ISIS video after seeing the crime on his phone.
Police said he also asked to show ISIS flags in his hospital room.
He asked not to be guilty of a 22-counter crime.
David Patton, a representative of Cyprus, is one of the public defenders, who say they are "clearly disappointed" in the decision of the employee.
"We think that, without any possibility of being free, it will only stop the mental attack of these events, instead of accepting a life sentence," Patton said.
The security team in Cyprus told the first employees not to ask for the death penalty.
Tori MP says that Suzel Faraz should be made an agent for a brief conversation
Nigel Faraz swore to "assemble an army of people" during the clash in Tori Conference.
The former bishop leader told politicians to "understand the environment" from Euroskeptics -- because one of the MPs in the May itself suggested that they should talk to the European Union.
The Rufusist Backbanker Peter Bone told March in Burma that if Mr. Faraz had been sober, Britain would have been out by now.
But the challenges faced in solving their extremely divided rankings by Mrs. Rémi are highlighted by the Pro-Réman Tower to add a different opposition to the city's Brexit.
Prime Minister Brexitier, Reminers and the European Union are fighting to keep his guard's plan on track during the attacks.
The co-workers urged that she would try to disagree with Brussels rather than backlash - and pressure Euroskeptics and employees to choose between their packages and vice versa.
Mr. Bone said leaving means leaving Riley in Saul, where he wants 'to throw the cheques'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should become a partner and be given the responsibility of talking to Brussels.
'If he were a preacher, we'd be out by now,' he said.
The MP or Sand from Wellingboro said: 'I'll stand for the brexit, but we need to get the cheques out.'
Setting up his army in the European Union, they said, "There is no need for us to be subjected to any of the world's wars."
We wish to make our own laws in our land.'
Mr. Bon deposed all the suggestions that changed the public opinion after 2016: 'The idea that British people have changed their minds and want to live is completely a lie.'
Tori Brigitier Andria Jenkin also said in March: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister G, listen to people.
'It's not popular between the public, the foreigner will not argue about it because it's not so popular between our party and our actors that actually surround the streets and exclude us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.'
In a message for the rich, they said: "The chief ministers keep their servants, when they break their pledge."
Mr. Faraz said that Riley's leaders should be 'informed about the environment' if they cheated on the 2016 referendum decision.
He said, "This is now the case between our people and our political classes."
'They're trying to deceive the brexit, and today we're here telling them, 'We won't let you run away.'
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, they said, 'I want you to create our political class, who is able to deceive the environment by understanding the environment.
'We are organizing the army of the people of this country who has won us in the Brexit and who will not rest until we become a free, independent and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the Reminrs marches from Burma in the middle of the city for two hours before rolling.
A group of actors pointed to Toriz against the Brexit Banner after the launch of this week's group.
Leber Pierre shows us to talk about the security issues that will arise from the party app at the opening of the Lord Adonis Conference.
'These are the people who tell us that they have the right IT system for Canada, the unrestricted limit and the limit for free trade in Ireland and all technology.'
'It's a complete joke.
There's nothing like a good brief, he said.
The President-in-Office plans to adopt a 'stupid' approach
American Sen. Elizabeth Warren says after the election in November, she will "be very keen on the conduct of the nation".

They were being taken to see how they could take the trunk in 2020.
Following the operation of the office by the Event Tramp on Saturday afternoon in Hollyok, he held his 36th meeting with the outsiders.
One of the participants asked if she was going to join the President's race.
Warren said: "It is time for us to go and make a fair deal of our women, and to be the first to join them."
LSU's death was encapsulated
Baton Disease, L.A., police announced on Saturday that on Friday, LSU basketball player Vede Sim was arrested for murder.
The Baton Disease Police Department announced the arrest of the 20-year-old Data Symposium at 11 a.m. ET news conference or assembly.

Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton finished the world title after winning the team at Sebastian Bethel
It became clear from that point of view that the Voltaire Bots should play a major role in the Order Race team, Louis Hamilton Mercds on Saturday.
From Paul, Bots started a good start and expelled Hamilton because he first built his place in two shifts and invited Bethel to join their team's drivers.
The hotel first went to Pitts and left Hamilton behind the package in traffic, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was behind a lap and came out of the back of the hotel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw that the driver of the Fari was reluctant to save on the third corner after a double-mouse without any delay.
Max Verstephen started from the last line of the grid and was on the scene at the end of his 21st birthday at the end of the Lap.
And he turned his face toward a large part of the race, when he set his face toward it to change his tire, and went out quickly from Kimi Raconen in the fourth place.
In the end, he entered the pits on the 44th lap, but the remaining eight laps were unable to increase his speed when Reconen reached the fourth position.
It was a difficult day when Valteri did a very good job all week and is a really good person.
Team won one-two and performed a great show, Hamilton said.
It was really a bad idea.
President Donald Tramp lied to Senator Dean Finnstein on Saturday at his request, he did not reject the letter of Christine Blassy Ford, in which he charged him with the alleged murder of the Supreme Court, Brett Kwangua.
While speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the President of the Senate Justice Committee did not directly refer to the statement given by the Forum, instead of commenting on the current situation of the Senate, he said that people are "means and evil and unfair."
"In the last few days in the Sentinel, a very good thing or something, when you see anger, when you see angry people, mean and bad and dishonest people, they say,
"When you see release and Lick and then they say, "Hey, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dean Finnstein, did you do it?
His answer is... did you get the document -- "Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no.
I didn't do it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we slip... No, we didn't, he said to the sinister.
Finnstein was sent a letter about the charges brought against Kuwaiti return in July and it was filed in early September - but Finnstein refused that it had been removed from the office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Doctor Ford, I didn't close his story," Finnstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He told me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as he said."
But the president did not accept his rejection, who commented on Saturday night's radio: "I told you this was really a bad attitude.
He may not have done it, but I may have seen it before."
The president continued to defend the three women, who were accused of crimes by the Supreme Court, saying that the Democrats were using charges on their own.
"They are determined to take back power from any necessary means.
You see their meaning, corruption, and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running to get power or power or control," the media reported the president's words.

Dandi Starks won a 5-3 return match in Dandi on Saturday to pay for the loss of the elite league against Belfast Giant on Friday.
Patrick Doier and Frances Beauvilleer gave Giant two goals at the start of the attacks.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowni took the home side level before they were re-installed before Giant's leader.
Francos Bosch made it equal to Dandi before winning two rounds by Lucas Lundwalt Nelson.

Giants, who have lost their last five matches, are now playing their home in Milton Ken on Friday in their next match.
Air Traffic Controller was killed to ensure hundreds of people could escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller is greeted as a hero or sailor, since he was killed to ensure that hundreds of people were taken safely to land.
More than 800 people were killed and killed after the main earthquake activated on the island of Solavesi on Friday.
And the following plagues were done in the field: and there were many that were carried away captive in Pallu under the hand of Malbe.
But when his associates were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Aggang refused to leave his post under the busy control of Matira Sis Al Jafi Airport Palu Airport.
He was standing there to make sure that the daughter Air Flight 6321, who was then on the run, could safely descend.
Then he went off the traffic control tower, when he saw that it was going to fall.
Later they died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Johannes Cirtret, said that hundreds of people could survive this decision, ABC News from Australia reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from public transportation to Kalimenton to take them from another city to a large hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them before we got to the helicopter.
"They broke our heart by going," he said.
Meanwhile, officials are afraid that the number of people who die with the destruction of the country can reach thousands, the alpine agency says that access is limited to mountains, scis and botonsh.
"The rate of death can still increase because many dogs can still be forced to remain or be forced into mud, or in many places where they can't be reached," said the Agency's spokesman Soltopo Nugarho.
The high hills destroyed Palu, and on the same day was this day buried.
The military and commercial aircraft are receiving assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Skye News: "Every minute the Ambules came with the corpses.
It's hard to find clean water.
Every town was seized by a small group.
Jan Galfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesia Red Cross is running to help live, but we don't know what they're going to get there.
It is surely a disaster, but it will be [even] worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, arrived on Sunday and told the country's army: "I'm asking you to work day-to-night to get out or empty all the work you're doing.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
In Indonesia, about 550 people were killed at the beginning of this year in Lobunk.
Micronesia Air crash: Air Nugian now reports that a man is hiding after the plane crash
Airline, who is operating an accident plane in the Pacific Ocean in Macedonia, now says that a man is missing when it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew or crew were taken safely from the plane.
Air Niugini said on Saturday afternoon in a release that it didn't find a man to travel.
Airlines said he was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline does not respond immediately to requests for information about airline travel, such as its age or nationality.
While trying to land on the wrong island at Airport, when the plane crashed into the water, local ships helped to save other passengers and drivers.
The authorities told him on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
Airlines said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them are still standing.
The cause of the crash and the incident is unclear.
Airline and American Nevi say the two planes don't land properly on Runve.
Some of the witnesses or witnesses thought that the plane wasn't coming down.
U.S. Traveler Bill Jen said the plane was very low.
Jane said, "This is a very good thing."
Jan said he and others were taken out of the deep water immediately on a plane that was sinking.
And they said, The airmen were affrighted, and cried, and he was struck with a stroke on his head.
The United States Nausena said that mariners working around to improve the damage also helped to protect people by using an airship at about 30 metres (100 ft) before sinking the plane.
The Evolution security network data indicates that 111 people were killed in the PNG-registered Airlines crash in the last two decades, but none were included in the Air News.
The analyst explained the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
In 2014, the Congressman restored his head on Saturday to condemn a man in charge of burning a woman alive.
The department of the U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Rolet presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation.
He told Jury how he used cellphone records to bring together the activities of the 19-year-old victim, Quonton Tellis, 29-year-old, who died on the night of his death.
Rolett said that he got the location data from several cell phones, which shows that the death row was with Tellis Chambers, the Clarian-Lager reported, breaking his previous claims.
When the data showed that when he said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, his cell phone was near Chambers, the police told Sanford.
And Sanford went forward on the sabbath, and told his words, and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When asked the officers if Talis was telling the truth, when he said that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying because his truck was in trouble."
The second condition was that Talis said that he knew Mr. Chambers about two weeks before he died.
Cellphone records show that they knew each other only for a week.
Rolett said that shortly after the death of the Chamber, Talis removed all text or message, call or contact information from his cell phone.
He said: He has destroyed her from her life.
The defense party is ready to start its completion argument on Sunday.
And the judge said unto them, It was expected that they would go into the judgment hall that day.
High Bridge: What is the alert or alert hip hop?
The hip hop flag wants to fill positive messages in its music to change the negative view of style.
High Bristold from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has drifted away from her child to deal with political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and make the popular hip-hop watch again.
Fuses and Common have seen a recent resurrection in Britain through artists such as Alaka and the people.
What other man?
The NY Nanny will judge the Eagle Dampet after the "Nazi" text has been fired.
When a New York girl complains by a mother that she is "the other black person", she judges for the biased flagship after texting.
They deny that they're resistances, that they're judgmental for "encouraging".
Lincy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, discovers that Gisal Morris, who is the caretaker of the new children, was a black woman on her first day of work in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Sister Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his forgetfulness, a "absorbed" plasma-flexman expelled Sussir Morris, stating that their ex-wife, who was African-American, had done bad things and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Sister Morris was sent home to Ober to pay for one day's work.
Now, Morris is asking for $350 per day to get out of work and for six months, although he was assigned to work in Liv-in Giga without any permission.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do anything like this," they said, "I know it's prejudice," he said on Friday in a post.
The young lady said on the charges that she was a nationalist, saying that after she was humiliated, they couldn't trust her, it was proper to finish Maurice's daily life.
"My wife sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not atheists, "the husband that Plasco told the post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you have ever insulted, even if it has been a mistake?
A Child in Your Youth?
Leave it."
Like in the case of "enforcement", Plasco said that his wife's children have only been in two months and he's in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you following any of these?
It's not right to do that," the entrance banker said.
While the legal trial is still under way, they have quickly responded to the charges against the social media by concealing their behaviour and arguments.
Paddyton’s publishers are confident that the reader will not add it to his own thoughts and opinions, and the new letter reveals it.
Karen Jenkel, the daughter of Bond, who was born after the book was accepted, said in a letter: "It's hard to think of putting someone in place for the first time before it was published.
It's amazing to know about Pandington's success."
Referring to his father, who had been inspired by a small gun and worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a child's book, he was hopeful to deny his work, he said that in the 60th anniversary of the publication of their book after his death, both were "happy and lost".
Regarding Paddington, which she describes as "the important member of her family", she says that her father was proud of his possible success.
"They were a quiet man and they weren't really proud," he said.
"But because Pandington was very real to them, it was almost like you have a child who gets something; you're proud of them, though you're not actually doing it.
I think he's seen the success of Paddington that way.
Even though their designs were such that they would always give thanks to him.
My daughter was dying and I had to call her on the phone
Upon landing, his daughter was taken to a hospital in Luis Pastor, Nice, where the work done by doctors was lost.
"Nade was regularly saying that it was really bad, it wasn't such a hope," Mrs. Edenen-Lapurus said.
"Then Nad called me and told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to call her adorable.
And I did.
I said, "Bye, I love you very much, son.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctor’s medication was slowly ending up leaving her system to attack her heart.
She would have died a while ago, and all of it would have been closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, even knowing it's gonna end.
I could not do any thing by crying, or by crying, because I was surrounded with my family.
I had to take care of them all."
Finally, Mrs. Edenen-Lapurus, who suffered the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other travelers, who were unaware of what they were going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down and I was crying all the time.
It was hard to express, but I got to see the feeling of so much sympathy for the nad on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of women suffering from suicide on the bridge
The two women, who have lost their loved ones to death, seek to make others stop them from their own lives.
Sharan Davis and Kali Hoffre post cards and phone numbers on Welsh Bridge with encouraging messages that people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 years old when he was suffering from depression and he committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mr. Davis, living in Lidney, said his son was a Honhar Chef who was spreading his smile everywhere.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They used to say, "Its (smoke) is of no avail!"
Although he left his work before he died, and was in a very dark state.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then looking for his lost brother or sister in his 11 years of age, committed suicide.
She said, “I was worried that there was going to be a dark event.”
"To tell people that there are people out there you can talk to, even if he's no friend.
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Sysri Hoffris, who has been friends with Sysri Davis for years, lost his 15-year-old friend Mark shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or sad or sad or anything else," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we would have changed his behavior.
It was a day of anguish when the children opened their presents, but they were unable to see.
He said that his death was a big step for him, but they had to get out of it: "He kept the family from scratching.
It hurt us.
But all of us had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Kwangua was in vain when the FBI began its investigation
"I thought, if I could really find something that he's looking for -- a limited time and a limited range of tests -- maybe we'll get some unity," Mr. Flock said on Saturday and they're afraid that the committee between the accused private gridlock is breaking up."
Why did Mr. Kwangua and their Republican supporters want to test the FBI?
It was because of their bad times.
The average election was only five weeks away, and on November 6th -- as expected, Republicans display very bad, they would be seriously weakened in their efforts in the high court they wanted to live on the ground.
George Dblu takes the phone to call the Bush Senator, preaches them to support Mr. Kwangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through them meets his wife Ashley, who was private secretary or secretary of the Mr. Bush.
What happened after reporting by the FBI?
There will be riots in Sinnet, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not clear that Mr. Kwangua can get at least 50 votes on the Synet Flore, which Mike Pens, the vice president, had to finish it and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean mines have been hit by a 'roof'
North Korea in South Korea fell seven years ago when John-on came into power, a South Korean regulator said.
Referring to the southern union ministry, Park Beyong-Syak said that 1,127 people fled their jobs last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the high rates imposed by strong borders between North Korea and China were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
A large number of gangs from the north are finally proposed for South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean war since 1953.
The largest Chinese escape, which is the longest with North Korea, and it is easy to cross the protected protected areas between two Koreas.
The Chinese consider the fugitives to be unjust, and often send them back into their own land.
The relationship between the north and the south -- which is still technically in the war -- has been improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries are meeting in Pyongyang for talks, focusing on non-sensitivity talks.
It was active after the historic meeting between the President of the United States of America in June in Donald Trup and Singapore, when they widely agree on working conditions for the free Korean custom.
But on Saturday, Foreign Minister Rei Yang-ho of North Korea blamed US restrictions on the decline in progress.
"Without any faith in America, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, we will have no way of first bringing each other to harm," Mr. Ray said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelory called Brett Kwangua a "major," he said he wasn't entitled to the Supreme Court.
The Haus Alptop leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court's hopeful Brett Kwangua "major" and said that he is not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on a witness at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't believe that a month can even show like this, they call it "major," Pelosi said to Thursday in response to the witnesses from the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kwangua emotionally banned the charges that she had ever prosecuted Dr. Christine Blassy Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial speech, Kwangua was very emotional, talking about his family and his school years sometimes crying and snoring.
They clearly condemned them by the giftists on the committee proving mythical to the charges of "miracle and integrated character secretion", which were angry at the loss of the 2016 presidential election of Hillary Clinton.
Palosi said he believes that the Witnesses in Kuwait have proved that they cannot work in the Supreme Court, because it shows that they are committed against the Democrat.
"I think they made themselves wrong with those things and also how he went to Clinton and Democrat," he said.
Pelosi questioned whether, upon being asked, the Congolese would be able to stand, and whether it would be guilty if the Democrats were to take a majority position at the meeting.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not right for the Supreme Court, but because of being invited, he can work right now," said Palocy.
Kwangua is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Palosi said that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the possible rules of the Kuwaiti regime against the security of Act or Ro V.V.V. because they are known to be lawmakers.
In his statement of approval, Kwangua abstained from questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"In his conviction, he ignored the questions raised by Kwangua if he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
And women need to move it.
It's a religious perspective, the anger of months and years comes out, and she can't stop herself from crying.
Mrs. Stemin said 45 years later to me, "When we cry, we get angry."
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She said, "A woman helped me with a great deal of work for an officer who said that even when she got angry, she cried, but she developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought that it was a very good thing."
The tears are allowed to go out as part of anger because they are basically misunderstood.
An initial job, a man of my chief office, is one of the most memorable memories I've ever had when I found myself crying in a sort of anger, and I found that an old woman had grabbed my neck from the back -- a stalk manager with whom I've always been a little scared -- who had me stuck in the stairs.
He said, "Never cry in front of anyone."
"They don't know how high you are.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy with them."
Patricia Schroeder, a lady president of a Democratic Congress from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested in a boat or in the name of Manki Business, together with the marriage and his name was taken back from the race, Mr. Schroeder, who was extremely disappointed, decided to take part in the presidential race himself.
"It wasn't a thoughtless decision," he said to me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other hopeers in the race, and the last thing they needed was another hope.
Someone called him "Sno White and Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been delayed, he had no time to collect money and therefore swore that he would not take part in the race until she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who had given men $1,000 would only give him $250.
"Do they think I have any freedom?" she was surprised.
When he made his speech as he announced that he would not launch any professional effort, he could not overcome his feelings -- thank you for the people who accompanied him, for the system that made it difficult for him to collect wealth and for the attention of the representatives, and for the frustration and the frustration of the sexism.
"You must have thought I'd have a nervous break down," Miss Schroeder recalled how the press would have reacted to them.
"You'll think that Clonex is my corporate promoter.
Do I remember what they would do to my decision?
"He cried?"
How America-China's trade can be good for war twinning
The trade war between America and China was about to slow down, and while the war is far from over, experts said the country could benefit in the long term from sowing.
U.S. President Donald Trump said that the Chinese chief, including solar panels, steel and aluminium, had been exported and warned first in the beginning of this year.
The most important increase in this week, with an item of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), is being placed effectively on the supplies from all half of the United States from China to the United States.
Bjing has always resisted in his own way, the last time 60 billion dollars of American equipment is from the top 10 percent of the United States's sleeping fare.
China has promised to join the US Shot-Se-Shot, and the world's second largest economy is likely to be fast.
To get Washington back means to fold the demands, but it would be very embarrassing for the President of China to head back to the United States in public.
Still, experts say that Beijing can move its way, trade in the Americas can positively support China over a long period of time by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that start economic telespin in the country, which is actually more dangerous than previously seen by viewers," said Abigail Grace, a research association focusing on Asia for security, a think tank.
Syrian refugees are ready to return, foreign minister said
Syria said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al-Molom said that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on earth is more stable and secure because of the progress made against terrorism today," he said.
