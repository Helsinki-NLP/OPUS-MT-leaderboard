Welsh members are worried when they look like a muppet doll.
There are concerns among some AMs about a suggestion that their name should be changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/ Member of Parliament Welsh).
This was caused by a plan to change the name of Majelis to be the Parliament of Welsh.
The AMs all over the political spectrum are worried if it can lead to disappointment.
A working party said that his group was interested, "That's a good name with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirty.
A member of the council (AM) said that his group as one union, felt "unhappy" and had suggested some alternatives.
A conservative Welsh said that his group "open-minded" about the name change, but it estimated that this was an introduction from the short MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the English word w in Welsh is rendered as the English word y in Yorkshire.
The current Supreme Commission has laws to introduce the change of name, says: "The final decision on any explanation of the name for the AMs is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The Wales government’s 2017 decision gave Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a public consultation on a well-known proposal to receive broad support for the title of the Majesty as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the issue of AM, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Members of Parliament Welsh), but the MWP option gets the most support in public consultation.
The AMs seem to provide alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can dissociate the leader, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the bill in a couple of weeks.
These reforms laws will cover other changes-- changes in how wholesale work works, including disqualification rules for AMs and committee system planning.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss laws.
The Macedonian people went to give a speech on the referendum on the change of country name
Voice owners will decide whether their country name will be changed to "North Macedonian Republic."
That powerful appeal was carried out in an effort to settle a dispute for a decade with Greece’s neighbor, who also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country on its north side shows an acknowledgement of its territory and has repeatedly rejected the offer of membership of the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, a voice-retirement opponent for name change, has said that he will ignore that voice-retirement.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Lonceng-lonceng when the church in Harlem was in trouble.
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adam
"Today, no one."
He said that disappearing all those bars could be overcome.
"People are socializing in another way" now, he said.
"It's no longer the public's guest room around where people regularly visit it."
Likewise with the church, he worried that the proceeds of the asset sale would not last long as the leaders expected, "and quickly or late they will return from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by an apartment building with a condominium filled with people who would not help keep the holy places around him.
"The majority of people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white people," he said, "and that's why they'll speed up the day where these churches shut up at the same time because it's not possible that those who move to those condominium will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the white community before Harlem became the metropolis of the Black People’s Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The Metódis region of the original white skin moved in the 1930s.
The black - and - black areas around the area have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of Prince John Howard, who led a chain boycott on the 125th road, the main way to shopping in Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
In 1939 a fire destroyed the building, but when the parishioners, Prince Johnson, planned to rebuild it, they built a tower tower tower.
Prince David Johnson, Prince Johnson's son and his replacement at St. Martin, proud to call the tower bells "Lonceng poor people"
One expert who sounded the tower bell in July gave him another name: "A cultural treasure" and "a historic instrument that is unparalleled."
One expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by black leather musicians, Dionysius A. Lind who turned on the larger tower bell in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in Santo Martin in the last few months was a complex architectural and contractor story, some brought by public church leaders, and others brought by the Episcopal general.
Westerners -- the board of directors, formed of public leaders -- wrote to the generals in July with concern that the group "will strive to weigh costs" on the western side, even though the Westerners are not involved in the group's architects and contractors sent by the generals.
Some parish peoples avoid less transparency on the part of the general.
Hiu injured a teenager 13 years of age in the California lobby experience
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he slammed to catch a lobster in California at the opening of the season lobster, teaching an officer.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had drowned with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then grouped himself together to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only a joy after he caught the lobster, but then he "attempted" that the boy yelled, "I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
All the bones are broken," Hammel said he realized when he got the kid.
"I cried out to all the people, saying, 'There is a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the San Diego Children’s Hospital, where he was treated in critical circumstances.
The shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Larry Giles Beach Rescue said in a media conference that a shark had seen in that area a week earlier, but it was classified as a non-hazardous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had a severe injury to his body.
Officers shut down access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security.
Giles realized that there were more than 135 shark species in this region, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sainsbury's article split the English beauty market
Sciencebury takes over Boots, SuperDrugs and Debenhams with the beauty-like kiosks of the tortoise that was run by the specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial drive to the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household appliances down, the larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed as more shops next year if it proves to be successful.
Investment in beauty is a hunt for the supermarkets to use the drugs used as a front-end TV, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sciencebury said that it would represent a great deal of beauty offers up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The brand range that exists now starts from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the rotting area as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its package array so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - something more interesting by the young shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume cleaners will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first one opened in Croydon. South London last week, while the second one will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Online shopping and changing the daily needs of food in small numbers in local shops means that the supermarket has to do something more to lure people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of Sciencebury, has said that the speed will get more and more visible as Mall when the supermarket chain is trying to fight back the climbers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more free services.
Sciencebury has put Argos' gears in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat gears since they bought them two years ago, which he said has supported the sale of food daily and made a more favourable statement.
The previous supermarket upgrade to the beauty and pharmaceutical department ended with failure.
Science was testing the crackdown with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after there was a dispute about how to divide the profits from the chemical market into that supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Farms' novelty, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was announced that Lloyds would play a role in that article, adding a number of excellent skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencebury, said: "We've changed the look and appearance of beauty kiosks to improve the mood for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be willing to offer advice.
Our brand number is designed to suit all needs, a tight environment and a comfortable location.
Peter Jones 'warm' after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million contract
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones went "with rage" after the TV director Holly Willoughby drew himself from a life-style deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to handle the trademarks of their houseware and their accessories, True.
This couple's business is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The director of this morning's show, 37 years old, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star" Den, Pete Jones angry with an interest in the last few hours, from their lucrative lifestyle business - to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones was so "hot" when the gold girl admitted during the meeting on Tuesday at his business center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new deal was worth up to £1.5 million, which means he no longer had enough time to serve on the trademarks of their domestic appliances and accessories, True.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to increase Willoughby's wealth by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left True, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says, "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be a long-term future, which would keep it going for a few decades.
Its decision to give up put everyone involved in it to the greatest extent possible.
No one can believe what happened on that Tuesday, very close to the launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell."
The experts believe that this Morning, which is one of the most expensive English stars, can damage the company to millions of dollars because of a large investment in product form, starting from blankets and candles to clothing and household equipment, and there is a potential for further launch.
And this can mean it ends with a long relationship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby set up True with Capp in 2016, and 52 - year - old Jones joined in the leadership in March.
The couple were on vacation together, and Jones had 40 percent of the stock on the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV director of I'm A Celebrity.
A number close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously 'and then we fell in love'
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the news because of making comments that were viewed by some as "non-presidential" and had been very positive to the North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump surrender so much?
Trump said with the "new-reader"'s voice.
"I don't give up anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting twice after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for the nuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to the world leaders. The United Nations General Council on Saturday said that North Korea did not see any "responsibility" from the United States regarding the early movement of North Korea's weapons.
On the other hand, he noted that the United States continued to impose sanctions designed to keep the pressure under control.
Trump looks more optimistic in the range of his speech.
"We're doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship,"
He said that his success in improving his relationship with Kim had resulted in a positive end to the rockets, helping to free up the hostages, and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he's defending his insensible approach to talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into the arena this morning, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the right side of the crowd.
Indonesia Tsunami and Camp destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations have been told that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, there was no national declaration of disaster, as a requirement for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have explained that they do not ask for international help, so this is somewhat challenging," Mrs. Sumbung said.
While Save The Children are planning a team to go to Palu, it's still uncertain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the jury spoke on the national disaster management board, said that the Indonesian office was investigating the situation in Palu to see if the foreign community was allowed to contribute to the relief.
In view of the ongoing developments in Indonesia, this country is still not ready to face natural wrath.
While the tsunami shelter was built in Aceh, it was not a public view on the other shoreline.
There is no tsunami warning sirene in Palu, although the warning has been reported, it is likely that there has been a significant contribution to the survival of the victims.
At the best of times, the journey between many islands of Indonesia is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
It will take at least three days to reach the new location.
President Joko Widodo has created broken Indonesia's infrastructure as the essence of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of the highway and the railways.
However, the lack of funds disturbed Father Joko’s rulership while he faced his election again the following year.
Mr. Joko also faced pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have embraced the form of a more conservative belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when Muslim and Christian groups fought in the streets, using guns, bows, and arrows, and other cruel weapons.
Witness: Player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge inserts balance goals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea at the Premier League with a score of one minute at 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received the bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea gate when the team left 1-0.
He puts the ball on his left before he kicks him to the far side of the ladder.
It's a high-voltage ball on top of the cage when the ball moves to the right-hand corner of the chain.
The ball finally fell through the risk of jumping and falling into a chain.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much of it, and just make a strain."
Chelsea led with score 1-0 in the first half after the original Belgian player Eden Hazard printed a blank on the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker turned the bait back to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before turning close to the middle line and running fast into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave the bait and ran in the middle line.
He then made a perfect effort to lead Hazard into the wilderness.
Hazard made it through the back of the fight and kicked the ball into the corner of the gate with his left leg, through Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool v. Naples in the league of the League of Champions at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.

The victims of Indonesia's tsunami increased to 832
Earthquakes and tsunamis have increased by 832 people, reports the World Health Organization on Sunday mornings.
Many people are reported to be trapped in the destruction of buildings that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 Richter scale that swept through on Friday and triggered a 20-foot flood, Sutopo Purwo, a jurist in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with fallen buildings.
The police arrested a man, 32 years old, for murder suspected after a woman was beaten to death.
A murder investigation has taken place after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside in the morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7.55 a.m. with some wounds in her hands, while a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked people around to see or hear something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "Research is still at an early stage, but I'm asking everyone around John's street at Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious to contact us.
I'm also appealing to everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the draft camera to contact us because they may have important information to investigate us.
The jury has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is local Birkenhead and he was found in a building.
Tonight, friends who feel confident that they know the woman had come to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Research is still taking place as police have said, they are in the process of telling their relatives about the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just returned to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to come in or out of the building.
The man couldn't say anything when he knew what was going on.
The citizens are currently being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer is hearing someone say that all areas are now being treated as the scene of things.
A woman appeared in a place where she was crying.
He's always saying, "This is terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two van cars were on the line and the others were out.
A number of officers are standing in line to watch the apartment blocks.
Anyone who has information requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on number 0800 555 111 with log 247 on September 30th.
The House of Parliament Cromwell was the last monument to be marked by a 'historic rewriting'
The destruction will be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban against many of the cultural and religious artifacts of England made by the fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "This cannot be avoided in the current debate on the destruction of images, that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster's palace will become a target.
The Anglo - American World War I was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendants of Cromwell were to be sacrificed for the actions of their ancestors, Thomas in the previous century.
The amazing representation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft was a 19th - century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many people still believe is worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, as a parliamentary advocate against outside pressure, of course, in the case of the kingdom.
Whether it's a completely accurate representation, it's still a subject of a heated historical debate.
Which is certain that conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the next nation's development, and Cromwell is a society that can be identified as an individual representing one side of that difference.
He is worthy of all praise, and worthy of all praise.
The Killer’s Babies Love Chinese Farmers Until They Leave
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, who was identified only by his brand name "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery, blood flow near a pig camp in the market in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to launch a vaccine to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in the Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door of the pig’s tent near him opened.
He said that in the pig’s den there was a great pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the burden of 550 pounds on the heart of the pig has persecuted the farmer until his death, according to the report.
"My cousin's blood and destruction," said the cousin known as "you," as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are reported to be speculating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts and caused a serious injury to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighed 650 pounds to the tractor of a Welsh farmer until the fearsome wife drove the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pig was usually not aggressive but the smell of blood could act as a "pemici."
"They're just playing.
They're shaking, they're curious... they're not going to come out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa storm brings their rain to the west of the United States.
As you can imagine, the Rosa storm weakened when it moved over the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Even so, Rosa will cause rains throughout the region of Mexico north and west of the United States a few days to come.
Rosa has a wind speed of 85 mph, Category 1 storm, starting at 5: 00 a.m. on the Sunday of the Eastern Region, and is 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa was likely moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pale began to form above the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approached the end of California on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push the tropics toward the north to the west of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches in most of the Mexican territory on Monday.
Then, a tropical tide that interacts with the closeest of rivers will create a massive rainstorm in the West of the Diaspora for a few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause a dangerous flooding, pudding, and the possibility of long-term land in the desert.
The low tropical tide will cause the rainfall levels of between 2 and 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain are estimated to descend in some parts of the West of the Day, especially in most Arizona.
The flood is likely to take place with conditions that deteriorate rapidly because of the widespread tropical rain.
It's not very recommended to go through the desert by walking on foot because of the tropical rain.
Heavy rains can lead to violent floods, and storms can result in local storms and droughts.
Nearly half the coast of South California would cause heavy rains in the area.
The total rainfall that exceeds half of the inch is quite possible, which can cause small points to flow and the road to the locator.
This will be the first rain in that region in their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin near Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before the rain is extended to Monday and Monday.
The great rains will spread to four horsemen on Tuesday and will continue until the Lord’s day.
In October there will be some great temperature changes throughout the United States when the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropical region remains quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic temperature changes in the short term.
There is an exact example of the dramatic differences in temperature throughout the U.S. Central Day.
There is a difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For a few days ahead, the remaining summer temperatures will be formed and will be returned to the field.
Most of the U.S. Central and Eastern regions are expected to start hot in October with a speed of 80s from the South Sea to the eastern sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high chance for temperatures above average for the eastern United States by mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's judgment.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the High Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused of sexual violence that was expected to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, with publishers concluding a regular event to announce an unexpected event in the last minute of Friday: An agreement by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that the woman was 100 percent confident if Kavanaugh was to crush her body in a drunken state and try to get rid of her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Perhaps there were more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, watching it.
The company accounted for the average mirror at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculation for other networks that provide this is not available fast, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble calculating the number of people who saw him in the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of spectators who are almost the same as the playoff football game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who thinks that its leader is very supportive of Kavanaugh's performance, is the largest of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the congregation all day, says Nielsen.
ABC holds second position with 3.26 million mirrors.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million mirrors and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the trial.
Flake was the key to the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican Party issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, being shouted by the sensational proponents when he tried to lift up to the justice committee.
He was standing down for a few minutes when he was tracked down, broadcast directly at the CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power when there are many women who are helpless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there were many other things he had to say in the committee.
The cable TV and the broadcasting network were all involved a few hours later, when the Judicial Committee would choose to continue the Kavanaugh search to the whole Senate for a voice recovery.
But Flake said he was just going to do it with understanding that the FBI was going to investigate charges against the calon for a week ahead, as the minority Democrats have asked.
Flake has been assured by some of the conversation with his friend, Senator Democratic Chris Coons.
Pasca talked to Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republic party won't have a voice to approve Kavanaugh without research.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accused the critic of playing "politically" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critic of playing "politically" with Britain's future and disrupting national interests, on his plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that appeared on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called a Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal for England and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "full of no sense."
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of the LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect at a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and in prison for murder at two levels, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The police told Sims that he had lost his eyes during the fight.
Police found those glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson DNA on that thing, the WAFB CBS affiliate reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he admitted he had committed a fatal shooting against Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
Coroner's office of the Eastern Baton Rouge Paroki reports a recovery report on Friday, says the cause of death is a head shot to the throat.
The department thanked the Gugus for the fledgling mission of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the Southern University police and the surrounding population in research aid that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement officer for the "strengthening and seeking justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
With a height of 6,6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
The average point is 5.6 and it's up to 2.6 in the game last summer.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade coach said his team felt "damaged" and "surprising" with Wade's death.
"This is what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Fireflies blue in Mexico City
Abus that came out of the fiery mountain Popocatepetl has reached the southern region around the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre alerts Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the fire mountain after activity has increased in the crowd and registered there are 183 emissions of gas and gray within a period of more than 24 hours.
The station watched a couple of violent and violent times.
The pictures in the media social media show a tiny gray layer that is stuck on the front window of the car in the vicinity of Mexico City.
Geophysics have recorded an increase of 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the city’s capital since the 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
This Mountain of Fire is known as Don Goyo, which has been active since 1994.
The Catalan separatist rebel police are pushing ahead the independence election.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protest protests with anti-circumvention police, and when thousands of people joined the demonstration of competition to mark the first polling ceremony in Catalonia about separation.
A group of pro-separatists who were held by the anti-aircraft police threw them with their eggs and threw them into the pits, so they created a dark cloud of dust on the roads that would normally be filled by tourists.
The fight also took place after that day with police officers using their staff to control the fight.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups shouted "Don't forget, there's no forgiveness" in front of the crowd of workers who cried out, "Hidup Spanish."
Fourteen people received treatment for the minor injuries they received in the prosthetics, reports the local press.
A year after the October 1st referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatist, the region was still in a high - ranking state.
The electorate prefers to be freer, even if the number of electors is low with some who oppose separation and most of the electorate.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the noise loss in the GST throughout the region in a severe storm.
Pro-independence groups camped last night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in national police support ranks.
Demonstration continues but is forced to take different routes.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended separatist prosthetics with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospects for independence.
"Last year we spent one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry indiscriminately because they could choose, but now we're trapped," he said.
Even though it was a little successful in the December regional election, Catalan pro-independence parties have fought to defend this year's moment, although many of their well-known leaders, who are in detention or in detention, are awaiting trial, for their role in organizing referendums and further declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with his cell phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been picked up by politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting harder," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would step forward in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for Europe's election is the best way to challenge the values of democracy and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly broke down a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the damage occurred at the door and the building itself.
A passerby may have been shot in the direction of the car at some points.
The goal that is printed by Menga has won for Livingstone over Rangers with score 1-0
First goal Dolly Wants for Livingstone to make sure the win
Livingstone's victory caused the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard from his position as Ibrox club manager, for both defeats in 18 matches.
The Dolly Menga attack has proved to be a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is similar to that of Hibernate in the second order.
Gerrard's side remains unbeatable in the Premiership this summer and faces the Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Previously, Rangers was visiting Rapid Vienna on the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, lengthens the unbeatable record of them in the division to six matches, while Holt coach's head still has been down since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston lost the chance to fight a brave guest team.
The Holt team should have been proud long before they scored goals, with their accuracy giving Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his effort went through the gaul, then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after the entry and the face of Craig Halkett from across the gaul.
The housekeepers are satisfied to let Rangers play proud early, knowing that they can trouble the arrival team on the occasion of the death ball.
And that's a way to create a very important goal.
Rangers of free tension and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got rounds and prints blanks from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers had dominated power but realized that the housekeepers could not be beaten and Liam Kelly was completely uninhibited,
It passed to the second chapter, although Alfredo Morelos managed to fish for the rescue of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was beaten by the guards of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow far away because of the tactics of other Livingstone games.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's cage and kept avoiding, while two counterclaims -- after Halkett's challenge to the replacement player Glenn Middleton, and one for handball -- refused.
Livingston's Phenomenal - Analysis
BBC Scotland Alaska Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
The performance and the outstanding results for Livingstone.
For a man, they're amazing, they're still beyond hope on the journey that continues.
The playing style and their staff have barely changed since they got back to the top, but the big credit must be given to Holt by how he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He's got so many jackets.
Captain Halkett was very big, leading a well-organized defense, while Toga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall stay alert during the game.
Even so, Rangers lack inspiration.
Whatever they did at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their final ball is less good - only once they can break the formation of the house side and it's a reminder to Rangers, who realizes their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan's got a mixed reception in Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skyscrapers on Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany - aimed at improving the relationship between NATO allies.
They argue about problems including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open up a new major mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-erdogan Protestants -- many of them Kurds -- also voiced, threatened both, the policy of Erdogan and the German government decided to welcome him to that country.
The protests depicting the existence of an instigator who was welcomed as a hero by some Turkish citizens and was called a dictator by others.
Shots on the Deptford highway: Bike riders killed in a car crash
A motorcycle driver was killed in a car crash that involved a car in London.
The strike took place near the Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a large street in Deptford, on the southeast side of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred months after another bike driver died in a run-in at Childers Street, about 1 mile away from the strike that Saturday.
Metro police said the officers were trying to identify the man and preach to his family.
The roads were closed and the bus routes were operated and the drivers were driven to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded officers in the trenches
Six people were injured in an accident in a man’s prison with severe care, the office said.
Problems occurred in the HMP Long Lartin prison at Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and still on.
Specialist Officer "Tornado" has been entrusted with the handling of the suspicion, involving eight prisoners and taking place on one side of the building.
Officers are being treated at the scene because of minor injuries in the face.
A jury spoke: "The specially trained sheet officer has been entrusted to handle the incident that is happening in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injury.
We do not engage in violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsible person will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison supports more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous naparadists.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a paramedic.
And in October last year, an anti-circumstance officer was called to prison to deal with serious frauds where a police officer was attacked with a billiard.
The pink storm threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a flood (Maybe it destroyed)
The tropical depression that hit Arizona rarely occurs, but that's what's likely to happen early next week because of the remaining traces of the storm that passed through the western power desert, triggering the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a warning that there is a flood on Monday and Monday for the West Arizona region to south Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa's supposed to be heading straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting Monday night along the rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said on Twitter that there are only ten tropical storms capable of causing tropical storms or depression in the area of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border area."
The latest Marines have been able to predict 2 to 4 rain-red inches with a isolation rate of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Another western desert area including the central Rockies and Great Basin is likely to be 1 to 2 inches, with probably the number of isolations reaching 4 inches.
For those in the mountainous region, the Rosa rain may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although the flood is a serious problem, some of this rainstorm is likely to benefit because it is now the western part of the power being drained.
According to the U.S. U.S. Coast Guard, only about 40 percent of Arizona's territory has suffered a little extreme, second-highest category," weather.com reports.
First, the route through the Red Sea leads to the Pacific Ocean on the west coast of Mexico.
Rosa, still on the stormy force on Sunday morning with the speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north with the speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit a colder area in the Pacific, and for that reason its strength was weakened.
That's why it's supposed to land in Mexico with the tropical storm power on Monday afternoon or night.
Rain may be high in some parts of Mexico, causing high flood risk
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected to penetrate California's Basin to the west of Sonora's power, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will cross the north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona on Tuesday today as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and south north on Wednesday night.
"The main risk that may be caused by the Red Storm or the rest of it is the very high rainfall in Baja California, the western zone of Sonora, and the U.S. western region of the U.S. desert." The National Storm Centre (NHC) said.
The rain is expected to cause the flood and storms of buildings that flow into the wilderness, and it happens to be long - term land in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects' murder attempt
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The young man was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in stable condition.
A 17 - year - old man, two 18 - year - olds, and a 20 - year - old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, policemen said.
The officer's been staring at anyone who might have had that video of the events on his cell phone to come reporting.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'accepted hatred and anger' from the Democratic Party
"A voice for the Kavanaugh Judge is a voice to reject the harsh and shameful Democratic Party's position," Trump said in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "accepted hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the search process
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, with forced and emotionally denying a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed sexual violence to her a few decades ago when they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified in the verdict on his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "The Americans saw the wisdom and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"One voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is the voice to strengthen someone who has the most perfect idea of law in our day, a jury with a record of true public servants," he said to a group of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's quest when discussing the importance of the Republic's participation in the middle of the election.
"Five weeks before it happens one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really getting drunk," he said.
"That's why I went there to come, fighting for a great chalon.
Trump argues that the Democrats are on the mission to "oppress and block."
The first-sounding procedure at Senate level in Kavanaugh's search was expected to be carried out at least late on Friday, a senior leader of the GOP told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed because of Indonesia's tsunami.
At least 384 people were killed, many were killed when the giant storm hit the beach, when the earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival at the beach in Palu on Friday, when the six - foot - high [18 m] flood destroyed the beach in the evening, causing a lot of death and destruction of everything it passed.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and not running away so that they could become victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a jury spoke for the BNPB at the right time in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged the car, wood, house, land all that was in the countryside," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea off at 800 kph (497 mph) before landfilling the beach line.
Some people climb trees to save themselves from tsunamis and rescues, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 service centers in Palu.
The air photo produced by BNPB shows a number of ruined buildings and shops, dams and farms, and a mass of water around them.
It's a slow-flowing storm that hits the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in 2.4 million people.
The Research and Technology Management (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released at the mass earthquake that Friday was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb force dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city’s geographic location, which is at the end of the long narrow edge, can be said to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage that occurred as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of a ruined building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured victims and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be larger along the 300 km (190 miles) coast of the north of Palu, a region called the Dongala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication "very slow with no information from Dongala, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading to a region affected by the disaster.
"This is a tragedy, but this could get worse," he said.
The agency concerned that Saturday received a lot of criticism because it did not inform that there was a tsunami that hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had hit on the time of the warning.
An amateur recording shared in media society shows a man on the floor on a building that sounds like a warning with a panic will be close to the tsunami, to the direction of the people on the street below.
In the minutes of the water cycle, the shoreline shuts down the building and the car.
Reuters can't immediately prove the validity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunamis are the biggest causes of the electricity shortage that spreads communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The military has already begun to send cargo ships with help from Jakarta and its cities, the authorities say, but refugees are still desperately in need of food and other necessities of the tree.
The airport has been reopened only to provide relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami victim increased by 800.
That's very exciting.
When World Vision officials from Dongala managed to survive in the city of Palu, where the officers were sheltered in the tent of tent cloths built on their site, on their journeys they had crossed a wide range of ruins, said Father Dosebah.
"They told me that they had seen many ruined houses," he said.
That's terrible.
Even when the relief team began to move slowly to start disaster relief activities, some of the group prevented the riots against foreign volunteers who had skills, who were going to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, immigration, relief of goods and energy from outside countries can only be initiated if disaster areas have been officially identified as a national disaster area.
It's not happening yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a jury speaking for the Red Flag of Indonesia.
"When the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can get international help, but there's no status yet."
On the second of the night, when the Trumpet is blown and the Trumpet is blown, friends and families of those who have lost their souls hope that those whom they loved will be part of a miracle to improve the course of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was expelled from the prison.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman who had been lying on the floor for two days with her mother’s corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, an Indonesian national team coach, has been a coach for two missing athletes, able to follow the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in Hotel Roa-Roa, with Father Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in the field of nursing, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Father Gendon recounted how after the news of the destroyed Roa-Roa Hotel departed around the paramilitary community, with despair he sent a message to whatsApp to the Palu competitions, which was also included at the beach.
Even so, all of his messages, only got one sign of gray pen, not two blue pens.
"I think it means no message sent," he said.

Kanye West: The Rapper turned its name into Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Advertised the name on Saturday's Twitter, he wrote: "It was formerly formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has already had the name Ye for some time and used it as its eighth album number, written in June.
The change was made before it appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to retriev his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to show on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons," said the performer.
As a short for his professional name right now, before West said that to him it had religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with the publishers of Radio Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
The name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye--as a mirror of our good, our misfortune, our confusion, all.
That album is more of our true self-defense."
He's one of a number of rappers who change their names.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator West, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of connection and large letters.
Mexico President AMLO swore not to use military in the face of civil society
The elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military force against civil society until the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against the students.
Lopez Obrador promises Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to push Mexicans."
The army fired fire on demonstration activities that took place peacefully at the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the movement of left wing students planted its roots throughout the Latin American region.
Lopez Obrador has already secured support for young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those in school and opening up more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education motivated young people to form criminal gangs.
The A.S. is supposed to represent the A.I.
Because China is more active in manufacturing intelligence, the U.S. should draw up the amount of money that will be used for research in the field, the investor and practice of A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who is already working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. was completely lacking formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its last year’s plan: to become number 1 in the 2030 AI innovation.
"Recognising the AI research funding is a good start, remembering all other countries tend to stay away from the US, and we're looking for the next drugs in the AI," Lee said.
Assuming the funds can give you a chance that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beats the best Othello American player, and then he serves as an executive at Microsoft Research and the Chinese Google President.
Lee admits to the U.S. government technology competition earlier like the Robotics Challenge for the Mutakhir Defense Research Project and asks when the next activity will be carried out, to help identify the next visioner.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win the government's prize, Lee said.
"It's not China that took the lead in the academy; it's a company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring people from universities for AI research for the last few years.
Lee says that immigration policy changes can also help the U.S. to support AI's efforts.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for HDD class holders in the AI field," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its next Generationist Wisdom Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Science Yaysan provides funds for people in academic institutions as well as other government organizations that share money to U.S. researchers, but the lower quality of academic work in China, Lee says.
Early this year at the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Building Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White Buildings announced the formation of the Committee on Construction Intelligence Selection.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For the NSF, DARPA recently invested more than $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for it to be set up by the National Security Commission for Built-in Intelligence does not see any further action for months.
Macedonians made a resurgence of the country's name
The Macedonians made a public call on Sunday to decide on the change in the name of the country as "the North Macedonian Republic," an action that will resolve the conflict for a decade with Greece that has begun its membership bid to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, defends the view that the name of the neighboring country on its north side represents ownership of its territory and has banned its association with NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reach an agreement in June on the basis of a new name, but nationalist opposition argues that changes will damage the identity of most ethnic Slavia Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in that general election and a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to whether the outcome of the election could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the vote required for the valid election results.
The question on the ballot is, "Do you agree to NATO and the EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a proper price to be paid to gain access to bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that are born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generations of Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament say that they will obey the results of the vote.
The name change needs to be changed to two or three times in parliament.
The National Elections Commission said there is no report of violations until 1 day.
However, it turns out that only 16 percent of the votes cast in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 were compared to 34 percent when 66 percent of the voters listed their vote.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an elector in the capital of the city, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice to the general election in Macedonia in a series of changes to the country's name that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, has prepared a small stage and pulled the seats in front of the tents made by those who will rewind the sound.
"We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join in honor, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a reputation.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has an employment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most people will agree to it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his voice.
He said "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday yesterday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of the electorate would take part in the delivery of the voice - less of the required number.
Another opinion, maintained by Telma Macedonia's TV station, found 57 percent of the responses planned to accompany them on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
To achieve that goal, 50 percent more than one voice is needed.
A failure in the soundout will represent a first policy rejection of the pro-Barat government since it took place in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City went through the entire Brighton defense to print a blank.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were handed over as Brighton's defense at Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made that victory look very easy on his score in the minutes to 65.
Argentina’s attackers received an opera in the field at the start of the game.
He ran among the three defenders of Brighton, before he entered the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four greens.
He turned over one defender before running ahead of a few other opponents at the end of Brighton's gang.
Then he hit on his left side, to Sterling.
That English front trigger took advantage of his first obstacle from the gang to operate the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to defeat the Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a thrust to the right of the gang.
"Aguero fights with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola City manager to the reporter.
"We've been talking about himself playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We'd be honest with him to print a bullet at that time."
But Sterling's the one who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League fight.
It's going to happen in a minute until the 29th.
Aguero took the ball, far into Brighton's area at the game.
He's on the ball with a deep-seated snout of his left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little ball stick before heading Sterling to the remote post.
The front slide of Sky Blue is turning the ball straight before the ball launches out of the border.
City against Hoffenheim in the Champions League game at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to claim a predator versus Rockies
By eliminating the Nationals from the playoff game, there's no more reason to force another game.
But Scherzer is too competitive to be able to beat Colorado Rockies in a game on Sunday, but only if there's still a playoff for Rockies, who is proud of a game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies at least didn't get a place after winning a wild-card game against the Nationals with a score 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first grade.
"Although we're playing without winning, at least we can't know the weather in Denver with a audience and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point that I may be facing this year.
How come I don't want to compete in a game like that?"
Nationals haven't announced an opening game for Sunday, but it's reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer compete.
Scherzer, who will start reading for the 34th time, holds a training session on Thursday and starts a Sunday game that is usually used for rest.
The Pitcher right-hand Washington is wearing 18-7 scores with the average running (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inches in this session.
Tromp campaigned in West Virginia.
The president was particularly concerned about the situation in which the Supreme Court ruled his election, Brett Kavanaugh, when discussing the importance of the Republic's public voice in the middle of the election.
"All the efforts we've made have been made in November.
Five weeks before he made the most important choice in our life.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump goes on, "You see there's a radical group of Democrats that's very exciting, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decide to take back power in any way, you see their wickedness, their wickedness.
They will have no power or control over them.
Democrats, he said, are in the mission to "stop and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, "democratics are angry and mean and untrustworthy."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein as a member of the Senate Tradition Committee, calling his name, who was warmly welcomed by his listeners.
"Remember the answer?
Are you sure you want to delete this document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it--it's a very bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a public service place.
Now he's being intolerant to anyone who shows up his mind
When Momentum activists at my local party gave a voice to threaten me, it was not surprising.
After all, I was in the last order of Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we expressed opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because he strongly defended anti-Semitism.
In my case, the riot movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, which is ironic about the issue that Jeremy Corbyn faced with previous leaders.
An announcement to the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I became a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday night was exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the quality of many meetings and promises about "better, more friendly" politics has not been forgotten for a long time, if it has, indeed, started.
The differences in opinion in the working party are becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is valued by the authority of the party.
It started as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a former colleague I thought would be able to share the same political view, began to expect me to turn around and accept the position I would never have before - either in national security or in the single European market.
Whenever I spoke openly and didn’t care what I was saying, then there would be pressure on the media society that asked for a stopover, the politics of the center, to tell me I shouldn’t be working at the labor party.
And it's not just me who experienced it.
Of course, I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues because of the comments I've been given political tendencies.
I admired my colleague’s professionalism and limitations, who faced sexual harassment or racism every day but never avoided it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the political era is the extent to which abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should help develop tolerance culture.
The fact is that we are no longer in a larger church and with each mission "untrustworthy" or change the party's selection of rules to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that moved me to keep my head down, not too much to say, and then I'm going to say, "All right."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Workers' Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, challenged by the maintenance of thatcher's government that literally reduced my class of compulsive schools, I have tried to fight for a better public service for those who really need it - both as a local council and a minister in the government.
I never hid my political actions, including in the last elections.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and things that I do not agree with in the leadership right now.
For those who encourage missions on Friday, which I can say is when the country moves quickly towards the Brexit division, it will endanger our country's business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the labor party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constitution, as a member of the labor party or not.

Pages 38 - 17 Melrose: Unfavorable Fathers Go to the Top
The last two trials may have been a little derailed in the end, but it's no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the Tengent's Premiership which is very comforting today.
Now they're in the lower order, the only unconquered side of ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and the ability to get the best chances, which made Peter Murchie's home team and coaching team a right to feel comfortable.
"So far we've tried our game, and we're still not defeated so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "The respect for Ayr, they're better off taking the chance than we're doing."
Grant Anderson's trial at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given to the game by Warriors, gave Melrose the chance to print numbers and Jason Baggot had a failed attempt.
Climo extended Air leadership with an officer, before, right in the middle of the time, he printed the goal then made a unique attempt to make Air score 17-5 at a time of rest.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s experiment, which was modified by Baggot, reduced the chance to five points.
Then there's a long trail because Ruarid Knott has had a serious injury, was stabbed out, and since he was back in the game, Ayr went ahead faster than Stafford McDowall, modified by Climo.
Captain Air Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a bidder pay with Bruce Colvine's unchanged attempt at the end of the pressure.
The houser has returned to play, but when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because of climo without balls, from the line of officers, MacPherson arrived behind the wounded Ayr.
Climo was replaced, as it happened again, almost since the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a huge strain and thwarted the fifth effort by Gregor Henry.
The Still Game star appears to be running a new career in the restaurant industry.
The Still Game Kieran star appeared to be ready to move the way to the service industry after it was first known that he was established as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis performance at the BBC popular, which was sponsored and built along with his former comedian partner, Greg Hemphil.
The couple already announced that the nine coming serial was the last episode, and Kiernan apparently planned to drive the commercial right after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's Director Aföringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun member pointed out that the Kirnan tried to get involved in "a growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘ The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by the sky, hopes that the court will return to the Pacific.
The crew did patrols at the large launch camp located in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a flag for the blue sea.
The Marine Corps camp from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with a motorcycle: "The sea is our right legally.
It's a duty to get back to life."
By the time Bolivia was surrounded by the continent, the memory of the loss of a beach line to Chile in a bloody conflict of the 19th century was still clear — like a desire to once again conquer the Pacific.
That hope was likely to reach its peak in a few decades, because Bolivia was awaiting a hearing from the court on October 1, after a five-year confrontation.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for its results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will be watching ICJ's trial on a wide screen throughout the country hope that the trial in Den Haag will support Bolivia's claim that - after a few decades of confrontation - Chile is obliged to assert the assurance of Bolivia's sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's native president, who was fighting a controversial war for the next year's election -- also has a lot of support for Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court can't decide Bolivia's wishes - and it's only going to change a little if it's possible.
The Netherlands-based United Nations has no power to surrender the territory of Chile, and has determined that it will not decide the outcome of the possibility of confrontation.
That ICJ's statement came only six months after the final argument was heard, which indicated that the case was "uncomplicated," said Paz Zárate, an international lawyer in Chile.
And it's still far from continuing Bolivia's claim, in the last four years, it's likely that there's just been some discouragement.
"The problem of access to the sea has been undermined by the Bolivian government now," said.
An aggressive rhetoric Morales has weakened the good practices of the rest of Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will remain at a certain point, but it will be very difficult to keep talking after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not changed their trades.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of the Bolivian government of Den Haag, quickly rejects the idea of decision-making.
Monday will give Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict of opinion with profit together," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-is one of the most famous Latin American presidents to use maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never release its right to have access to the Pacific," she added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see what we need to do in the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never break down nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He mentioned the United States of America carrying out an agreement made at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comment appeared when the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, appeared almost to begin nuclear diplomacy that had erupted for more than three months after meeting with Kim Jong One from North Korea.
Ri says only a "dream dream" that by continuing to sanction and oppose the U.S. on the declaration of the Korean War resolution, North Korea will surrender.
Washington was on the lookout to agree to that statement without Pyongyang trying to disarm the armed forces first.
Good Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
However, there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is seriously about the acceptance of the weapons warehouse that the country is the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris mode show shows a lot of recent collections of heads up to the main road near you
If you want to multiply the collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight do not look for others.
Valentino's designer and Thom Browne released a large-scale cover series for their SS19 collection at the stage of the fashion show with the fancy style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The really non-practical hats have wiped Instagram this summer and these designers have been showing creations that fanned the eyes at the stage of the auction.
The famous thing about Valentino is a cream hat that's decorated with a wide backbone that covers the head of the model.
Large accessories, including a number of beautified diamonds, witch hats and even a nose, are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also showed a group of weird and exact hats to Halloween.
A lot of different color masks his lips have been painted and like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A creature that looks like a snorkel and a glass of eyeballs, but it looks like ice cream.
And if you keep tracking the ad mode collection that-- then you're being honest.
Mode monitors estimate that the large hat collection will be based on the main road near you.
The big hats become a very running train in 'La Bomba', a rubber hat with a two-legged width visible to all the people including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkovski.
The label's replacement of a very non-practice hat from social media makes a big creation in the beach corridors of the horami which is almost the same as swimwear - worn with a bumper model.
The hot-rolled stripe bag, cut with rafia on the edge with a white leather strap, is a great thing from the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage's famous hairs said to F: "I hope to see a large hat and a beach bag arrive on the main road for the next summer--because the designer has made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the request for the big accessory."
John Edward: Language skills are very important to the global population
The Scottish State School kept track of the academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with remarkable results, which are increasingly strengthened by every student and collective success in sports, art, music, and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish School of School (SCIS) are working hard to provide the best service for students and parents.
Schools are designed to prepare their students for higher and higher education, their career of choice, and their role as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can instruct and implement school curriculums as expected, we saw modern language continue to be the eye of popular choice and wanted in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, your speech will enter his head.
If you talk to him in his language then your speech will enter his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest year’s test results, we can see that the language is the top league table position with the highest grade in high school.
A total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language get the A Plus value.
The data was collected from 74 SCIS schools that showed that 72 percent of students received the A Plus value in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent who also received the A value in Spanish.
This shows that schools in Scotland support a foreign language as an important skill that children and adolescents will of course need at an early age.
Now languages, as a learning eye option, are held in the same standard as the STEM study (scientific, technological, resource and mathematics) in modern schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the English Ministry of Labour and Skills in 2014 found that for some reasons the employer has to keep fighting in the lobby, 17 percent of the reasons for this lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly being developed to prepare young people for their future careers.
The increasing number of opportunities available to people with a language skills is a major factor in this world’s economy.
Whatever a person’s career choices, if they have learned a second language, they will in the future feel real benefits because of having such a life - style.
The ability to communicate directly with citizens of a foreign country will automatically create a superior multilingualist in competition.
According to YouTube's opinion on over 4,000 adult English in 2013, 75 percent of them don't speak foreign language well enough to make French speech and language the only language spoken in two digits, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for kids now is important for now.
Having a multilingual capacity, especially the language of the countries with a growing economy, will provide children with a better opportunity to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the most important language in English for a few years to come, 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in high school, with teachers who are members of this field.
Schools in Scotland are designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It can't be expected that at this point, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this should be taught in education.
In fact, modern language must be considered truly "international communication skills."
The high school will continue to offer choices, beliefs, and superiority to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is Director of the School of Scotland
LeBron is going to stand for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Expecting fans to see LeBron James overseeing his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening for the Sunday afternoon against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been determined how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell writes a tweet that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After this week’s initial training, James was asked about his plan for a six - game game in the Lakers season.
"In my career stage right now, I don't need to do a pro-season game to prepare," he said.
Common Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a public campaign this evening at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first public quarter of the five public quarters scheduled for next week, including a stop in some pleasant places involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was claimed that the resurgence was imposed so that he could elect the governor of the Supreme Court, Trump meant to build support for him for the general election of the mid-term because the Republic party would risk losing control of Congress if the resurgence was made in November.
How close is the common Trump in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch closely?
General Trump at Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 nights. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the common Trump in West Virginia online via direct YouTube.
The possibility that Trump would discuss this week's congregation for the Supreme Court of the Brett Kavanaugh, which is becoming increasingly tense after an unscrupulous sexual act and the idea of a senator's resumption, will be put to trial for up to one week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main purpose of this public agenda is to help the Republic’s party to get some time in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign mentioned that five public closes this week aim to "support volunteers and supporters because the Republic party tries to protect and expand the majority they hold in Senate and DPR," according to Reuters.
"Conference control is very important for its agenda so that the president will as much as possible move to the parts of the country during the busy campaign season," said Trump campaign leader who refused to mention his name to Reuters.
scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, the public's expected tonight to be able to present supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull the tape from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, a West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party who was left behind in the wake of an opinion.
"There is no good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to improve his performance in the wake of his opinion," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team bravely defends its hope in a unique Sunday match
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome session Saturday afternoon is what might be needed in this Ryder Cup.
At the moment, the band is a sport concept that is the result of a well - founded encounter with players, and no one is more than this in competition.
Where do they think they're at right now?
"Before, they're over six points and now four, so I think we're taking it as a little bit of a moment," sighed Jordan Speeth passing that day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of over four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, like Spyth says, felt they had a little moment and they had a lot of things that could be exciting, except for the formation of Spyth and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each of them proud three of the four points.
Speeth has played fatally starting from the tea area to the green area and leading with the situation.
The excitement of the stroke is getting harder when it comes, making an important puncture to make a series of matches when he and Thomas lose two opponents.
A stabbing blow from him that won them on the 15th that was received with a similar scream, a scream that told you that he was sure America was not lost.
"You really have to work harder and worry about your own game," said Speeth.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes to be marked.
The only player with points more than Speeth and Thomas for two days yesterday is Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a story that's unmistakable from Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey hit on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to flow well either from this vicious crowd that convinces them that they are the players to be defeated on Sundays, and there is no more famous player than Fleetwood or Molinari who will lock Europe's victory potential at sunset on Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time they're both put in a different hole.
But it's still too much to talk about Europe's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson reduced the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the nine front like digging a hole that will never be swallowed by this Spanish golfer and Sweden.
Although, on Sunday, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to be seen more closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the strategy can change for a while.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led quite far to the final day, but the forum session also showed that the U.S. team had the courage to compete despite suspicions from some sides, especially in the United States.
Europe's top 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit on the final day of Ryder Cup after getting up from the fourball game and foursome on Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
Two inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two victories over Tiger Woods who have to fight record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend the impossible trophies in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team target in the morning fourball, made this series a 3-1.
The United States gave more fights in foursomes, won two matches, but they could not reduce deficits.
Team Jim Furyk needs eight points of 12 unique Sunday games to defend the trophies.
Fleetwood was the first European candidate to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who were hit by "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend, were just the second couple to win four points from their four openings in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their four-balls became very strong to defeat Woods that leaped and debuted the American Bryson Dechambeau with a stronger 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two matches on Saturdays, once looked adorable but he had lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, resting at the morning ball, then back to partner with Henrik Stenson in the forum and defeating 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -- ranks one and three worlds.
Europe did not achieve it itself, even though today it is a fun and exciting day in western Paris.
The main winner three times Jordan Spielth and Justin Thomas set a two-point rejection for America on Saturday.
They won 2&1 that attracted Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the forum after losing the first two holes.
It just happened twice in Ryder Cup's history where a team came back from the four points deficit into a single game, although as a champion of the Fury team only needs a serial point to defend the trophies.
However, after becoming the second best for two days, the coming attack on Sunday seemed to go beyond them.
North Korea says 'no way' will kill weapons on the one hand without trust.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea presented to the United Nations a series of sanctions that continued to undermine their trust in the United States, and it was unlikely that the country would have broken down its nuclear weapons on the one hand in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly this year that North Korea had taken "significant steps to show good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, opening up nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Well, we didn't see any appropriate responses from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we can't disarm our own weapons on the one hand."
While Ri reiterates the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the approach of "stepping" to the destruction where North Korea will be punished for taking the step, a significant statement was made that they did not completely reject as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit between the US President's office and North Korea's leader this first held in Singapore on 12 June, at which time Kim promised to "denuclearize on the west of Korea" while Trump promises North Korea security.
North Korea has officially wanted to claim the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang had to stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused a call to extend international heavy sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure with the provision of fine sanctions to their purpose strictly, and even rejects "the declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"Perception that sanctions can make us kneel down is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that these continuous sanctions will inflame our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention a plan for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which led the United States in the early United Nations this week.
The minister also attended three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the troubled party in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization will not reach the end of Korea."
However, Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year's, when he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly that designing North Korea's rockets in South America was something that could not be avoided after "Mr. President of the Devil" Trump called Kim "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at a meeting of the United Nations, Trump the year ago threatened to "destruct" North Korea in total, imbued Kim with praise for his courage to take steps to eradicate it, but the great work still had to be done and sanctions had to be continued until North Korea committed denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months--no problem," he said.
Cowkok and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the U.S. Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be continued firmly and cannot fail until we know that full, final and verifiable denuclearization."
The Security Council has been raising sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an effort to halt the nuclear programme and the Pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the former U.S. General Council and then said he was going to visit Pyongyang another month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that there had been real progress, only North Korea in the hour count buried that he himself made a "accused like a gangster."
North Korea promises at a meeting with Moon this month to unravel the missile and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes the right action.
He said that Kim ordered him to do "appropriate action" with his wish was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard University took a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all S1 students there sleep more, trying to fight macho culture in a study that is developing through 'a ghost bird' powering caffeine.
An academic found that students at the university number one world often don't know anything if they're discussing very basic things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medical specialization at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleepless nights in the study.
"At last a certain girl came to me, saying, 'Why am I now made known to you, even to you, in the year of my death?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping--which surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The course started the first time this year, explained to the students the essence of how good sleep habits help the academics and the athletes, and improved their public peace.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a school that had very little sleep all week.
The course for this one hour involves a set of interactive tasks.
In one session there are drawings of a room, where students click on coffee cupboards, drawers, sports pants, and books to get an explanation about the influence of caffeine and light bulbs, and how athletic results are influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleeptime routine.
On the other hand, participants found an explanation of how long sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with an interactive icon, then motivates participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change the student's behavior in court.
But we're sure that they have the right to know--like things you have the right to know the effect of choosing to suck tobacco on health,' grew Prof. Czeisler.
The culture proud of the 'snowing' still exists, its atmosphere, plus that modern technologies and pressures that continue to increase to students that mean a lack of sleep is a continuing problem.
Ensure you sleep enough, with good quality, you have to be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, its air -- even to avoid weight gain, because a lack of sleep makes the brain activate the hunger mode, triggers hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old California, who studied chemistry and physics to help Professor Czeisler design the course, took one of his classes years ago during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hoped that the entire Easter school would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider organizing sleeptime alarms, including wake-up alarms, and realize the effects of the 'blue light' displayed by the electronic screen and LED lights, which can boost the rhythm of your circuit out of the line of order so cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal to bring down Gerrard's army mentality
Again, Rangers felt the sadness of the day of Dolly's attack to deliver Steven Gerrard's team that's been charged with a 1-0 loss in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team has been trying to record their first victory on their way, since the 4-1 victory in February at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team just gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving the team eight points of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class leader.
Attacking seven minutes before the first chapter is over and the rangers who run out of sense don't seem to balance.
While Rangers are now going down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third position, just left a random goal from Hibernate.
And it could be that there will be further problems in Rangers' cave after Calum Spence's guards have to be treated because the head wound after an object was thrown away.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that took Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costumes that loved their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the owner of the ball, but Livingstone takes advantage of the ball they own better.
They should have recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bet was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's cage, but the trigger attracted that big opportunity too wide.
The free market of the Jacobs' Square in the past met with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow can only get wide in his back position.
Rangers took control, but there seems to be more hope than confidence in their game at the third end.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he was supposed to have a guardian when he and Steven Lawless were engaged on a fourth-hour sign but on behalf of Steven Thomson refused to stand against the citizens of this country of Colombia.
Rangers only made two throws in the first chapter but the Ibrox guard before, Liam Kelly, almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head stroke and Ovie Ejaria's easy attack.
Although the goal of opening Livi in the 34th minute may be contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to overcome the deadly tactics of the inner Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball in Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Mega for a simple ending.
Gerrard took action when he retired by replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the exchange gave direct influence when the wing player put the ball on Morelos, but Kelly who played the game was amazed to get out of the line.
But Livingstone continued to force the field team to play exactly the game they enjoyed, with Lithgov and Halkett rubbing all the long balls.
Team Holt was supposed to exacerbate their superiority in the final stage, but McGregor stood up well to expel Jacobs before Lithgow slammed wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another guard when he was arguing with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his face again.
Almanac: Discovery of Geiger
And now from our Sunday Morning German page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and it's the day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method to detect and measure radioactivity, it's a discovery that eventually makes that device called Geiger Breaker.
Being a science tool since then, Geiger's break-up also became a pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," built by cowboy scientists who seemed to have little faith in Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's cracker, used to find radioactive mineral sites, such as uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effect released by the radioactivity in the mineral."
Evans: "Tell me, it must be coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old birthday.
But the discovery that kept his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to ‘know’ the evil cell
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' the evil cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of the cure
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, converting it into a laboratory.
They can then 'know' the general protein on many cancers and then be advised again.
A test vaccine shows the results of promises in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman was treated with that vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize bad cells, her ovarian cancer has been missing for more than 18 months.
This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, transforms it into a laboratory so that they can "know" the proteins that are generally present in many cancers called HER2, and then reinitiate the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Foundation in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "The result is that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increasing some types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovary, lung cancer, and colorectal, Prof. Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as patient immunization and teaching them how to design cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West started Diatribe Pro-Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL performance.
Not a Good Walker
Kanye West said on the studio during Saturday Night Live after showing up a mess where he praised President Donald Trump and said that he was going to cheer himself up in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic Party and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a show with a sandor named Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate's Legal Committee on the allegations of sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the record of the West's cracks is attributed to the social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to make fun of the West with that comparison.
Also, West complained to the viewers that he had trouble at the back of the stage because of the hat that was wearing.
"They're hiding me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're hiding me!
And then they say I'm drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see the sink?" she says she's going to wear the Superman dress, because this means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to love."
His comment produced at least twice of the viewers and the SNL performance seems embarrassing, Variety reported, with one person saying, "The whole studio is silent."
West was taken in the last few moments as a replacement for Ariana Grande, a former rap singer Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confused a lot of people with the look of the song I Love it, dressed like the bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the conservative TPUSA leader, Candace Turner, who wrote a tweet: "For one of the bravest souls: HE WAS LOVED TO BE A KIND OF FOOD."
But the director of Karen Hunter's show wrote a tweet that West was just "being himself and that was really great."
"But I choose not to offer someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his art) that I believe in and defeat the ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, said that he was now "a man officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's trail. He's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
With a rap singer, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and must have raised the legends of Prince, turned his name into a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.
Demand for attempted murder at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was beaten at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened at Ballyhackamore, police say.
The audience was expected to attend in front of the Belfast Court of Justice on Monday.
This charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticises poison masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his sword-fighting role as Jon Snow in the middle-century fantasy series full of violence from HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, against the stereotype of macho hero, he said that the role on such a screen made young boys often feel that they should be strong to respect.
Talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was sure there was something wrong and asked how to deal with a bad masculinity problem in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who just got married to her toy at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she felt 'strong enough' in discussing the issue.
'I feel personal, strong enough, right now--where's our fault in this masculinity thing?' he said.
'What do we teach men when we grow up, the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the emergence of bad masculinity with its very masculinity characters.
He continued: 'What is the character since birth and what is taught?
What was taught on TV, and on the street, that made the boys feel that they had to have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions at the time - how do we change it?
Because there's clearly something wrong with the young.'
In that interview he also admitted that he was not going to play in the prep or the game of Thrones at the end of the summer coming, saying that he had already 'ended with a field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit's been calling her back True West from Sam Shepard, a story about the film producer and his brother, who was a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I meet my wife in this show, so give me the future family, and from here my life begins' his words.
Rose played Ygritte, the character-loving flower of Jon Snow, in a series of fantasy winners of this Emmy award.
This couple were married in June 2018 in the home of Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Bingkok reports 14% of new cases
Dogs have announced 14% of their population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in this country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of the new cases were raised through sex, marking changes from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through several parts of Tigkok as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people living with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, the health care officer Tiongkok said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
From one year to the next, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in Tiangkok has increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT Tigkok community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Tigkok in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is becoming more important.
Because of the conservative value of this country, the study estimated that 70-90% of men who had sexual relations with men would eventually marry women.
Many cases of sexually transmitted diseases have resulted from improper sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Tiongkok government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that the staff has burned the data of the GOP senator, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'.
The U.S. Attorney Maxine Waters on Saturday protested that one of his staff had sent personal information to three senators of the United States Party to the site of the Wikipedia Members of parliament.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party stressed that the claim was driven by experts and the Ultra-Right Wing website.
"A lie, a lie, a lie, and a lot more evil lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
It's reported that written information includes home address and phone number of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
That information appeared on Thursday, sent by unknown people in the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel meeting on the unscrupulous charges of sexual conduct against the High Court of the United States of America.
The boyor appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as the Pundit Gateway and RedState report that the IP address that identifies the source of the consignment is connected to the Waters office and discloses information to one of the staff members of the Waters staff, Hill reports.
"The unwarranted charge is really wrong and is a definitive lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member -- who is an identity, personal information, and his well-being is threatened by a false and wrong charge -- is not responsible for the leaking of this information at all.
This is not a base charge, and it is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracts net criticism, including from former Press Secretary of the White Building, Ari Fleischer.
"This resistance means anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something that he does not do, they should not be angry.
They can't go away.
They cannot question the motives of the accused.
They will be peaceful and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic Critics about Judge Kavanaugh, who accused critics of looking too angry during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to push Waters into the mid-term election, also expressed her thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true," it says on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the correct authority and law enforcement entity about this wrong charge.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed," he added, "and they'll be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to one of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - a parody of Atkinson's poorly good novels
Now looking for the significance of Brexit in every new film with the basic view of England has become a tradition and it seems to be happening to re-launch Johnny English comedy parades -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarkasm of circumcision tell us how bad it is that we become a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, Johnny English, who looks like a bat, face a carte, and the non-competent has updated his license to mess up everything for the second time - his name gives more guidance than anything that he is a vast comical creation designed for the English-language cinema area.
Of course, he was a crazy agent who, let alone his strange suspicions, had a little Clouseau character, by the character of Mr. Bean and a group of travelers who contributed little notes to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
Indeed, he is based on the international male and female mysterious man who has ever played Atkinson on the Barclaycard TV advertisement that is now forgotten, leaving a mess behind.
There's one or two sweet moments on the most recent JE trip.
I liked the time Johnny English approached the helicopter by wearing the red dress in the middle of the century and turning round the rotor with a quick grip on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy was shown, but his humor felt powerless and too strange, especially when the film brand "serious" like 007 and Mission Ne's never trusted to insert comedy as a substance.
His humor feels like it's meant for kids from adults, and for me, there's a variety of weird, unfathomable Johnny English jokes and an Atkinson joke in Bean's personality.
The hot prize this year is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber player has entered a super-secret British spy web network, revealing the identity of all the British agents in the field, to disappoint the agent who's in charge - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a proud and hostile prime minister, who has destroyed his entire political population: Emma Thompson played very well with the character of almost Teresa-May but not much to be asked of.
His wise counselor gives information that because every active spy has been weakened, he must bring an exit from retirement time.
And that means Johnny English himself, now employed as head of school in some great buildings, but gave a secret lesson about how to do a funeral operation: there are some good jokes here, when English offers a college of spectators like School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency treatment and is once again united with old friends who have suffered from Bough, again commissioned by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, stalking a ship commander, a top-class woman who's a little evicted where Vicki Pepperdine is.
So Batman and Robin, who made a mistake of the High Secret Agent, reacted, met the beautiful mysterious woman of Ophelia Bulletova, founded by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister was worried about falling into the influence of the millionaire charismatic technology that admitted could solve the problems of the English computer: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started their ridiculous adventure: enlisting as a servant, they burned down a fast-paced French restaurant; they made a mess by sneaking up on Volta's luxury ship; and English started anarchy when he tried to use his virtual reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's home.
All the stops must be attracted to the last sequence, but with the kindness and suspicion of that, there's a few children's TV channels that are full of about everything.
It's quite modest.
And like the other Johnny English film, I can't think of it: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is really suitable for his talent?
Work is planning a plan for British citizens to be able to work four days a week but paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn, from the United States, considered a radical plan that required British citizens to work four days a week but paid five days.
The company was reported to have the company’s owners continue to produce relief products through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for workers by giving them additional holidays.
He will allow the workers to enjoy the rest of the week, but he will continue to receive the same reward.
Some sources say that the idea would be 'pass' with the party's economic agenda and the article moved the country to support the workers.
Changes to four days a week have been approved by the British Congress as a way for workers to experience the benefits of economic change.
A source, the senior of the Labour Force, told The Sunday Times: 'The conclusion of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This won't happen overnight, but four days a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalance the economy that supports the workers and the industry's strategy as a whole.'
The Working Party is not the first to support this idea, because the Green Party has promised four working days in a week on the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at this point, the aspirations are not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The jury said, "Working day in a week isn't party policy and is not being considered by the party."
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to complete his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the 'anonymous director' and the 'tenders' in the utility company.
This shadow Chancellor's plan also means, the stockholder in the drinking water company may not get the whole stock back because the government of the labor party can do the "suppression" with the reason for the breach.
He also made sure his plan to put workers in the company hall and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would raise annual dividends to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said to "60 minutes" if the FBI research on Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed his final appeal to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions as to whether this finding could affect the senators of the Republic Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Senator of the Republic Party. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, could the FBI find something that could make them change their minds.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his brother in South Carolina.
"My point, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, and the charge came up, and he said, "You did it?"
He's a strong, determined, determined man."
However, it seems that Graham’s voice could not be changed.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I know is that Brett strongly opposed it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned his name can't verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What does it mean to be a Global Citizen Festival, and has this event done something to prevent poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be holding the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music show that features spectacular stars, and an effective mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be witnesses to tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the purpose of this real event that ended extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international lawyers who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), concert guests have to complete a set of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending email to world leaders, calling, or other means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in reaching its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a gift as a free concert is the right way to invite people to act, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, motivated to set another purpose.
It has been said that this action has helped the world's leaders to announce a commitment and policy equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of which has been channelled or made money-absorbing.
This group estimates that security funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments, among them The Power of Nutrition, are based on the English-based regime that consists of investors and experts committed to "help children grow up to their maximum potential," promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the country's gypsy deficit after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, the founder, the national government, and the Global Citizen like you, we can make social injustices about this lack of teeth to be a record of history," said The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would extend 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Answering one of the questions at the Public Question on their website that asked you, "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen said, "This will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just like civil rights movements and the great anti-apartheid that's already before us, we'll succeed, because if we're united we'll be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars that appear on this year's show in New York, which will be watched by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy as a "blocked" to prevent the export of Russian energy - Secretary of State
"If necessary," Washington could ask the Navy to help prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary Ryan Zinke, as described by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly believed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where it operated on a legitimate government invitation, was a move to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just as they do in Eastern Europe, south of Europe," he reported.
And, according to that office, there are ways and ways to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lines are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the actors at the concert held by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a niral group that called himself "a voice of energy customers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach in agreement with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of efficiency, they are the same.
"The economic choices in Iran and Russia are less, using and replacing fuels," he said, calling Russia one of the "members in the field" with economies based on fossil fuels.
This statement occurs when Trump's government administration is conducting a mission in order to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is much cheaper for Europe's customers.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, were trying to lure Germany away from the Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a Moscow prison.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream oil tank project 2 is worth $11 billion, designed to enhance the oil pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fight against this project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an unfair example of competition.
"I am sure we have the same view that energy cannot be made a tool to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own way," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted the reaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has asked the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a major problem if third countries blend our energy markets," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "look at the situation" when we call as president in 2020, Senator Massachusetts's statement
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would "watch the situation" when he became president after a half-time election.
While campaigning at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider retiring.
"After it's time for women to go to Washington and repair our miserable government, including putting women in a position on the ground," he told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'll see the situation when I become president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when campaigning at the city hall, he said he "carried this region in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's blasphemous in presenting his criticism of Trump and the leadership of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a sound check."
However, a well - written opinion on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constitution itself did not want him to make a dedication to 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the elective "possible" in Massachusetts said the senator should not hesitate, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe opinion.
32 percent support those appeals.
That led to more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent who supported the possibility of emboldening themselves and 48 percent who opposed him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party that were discussed about the possibility of abducting in 2020 include former Deputy Prime Minister Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide on it in January, Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin sent PTSD Track Palin on the Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with violence in the house on Saturday night.
"What happened to my son, what will happen to him when he comes back, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers suffered," he said in front of the audiences who attended the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "in the chamber" and related about his son and other war veterans, "they returned with a little different, they returned with more hard, they returned and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, together with the soldiers and the refugees and every other soldier to the country."
He was arrested on Monday at Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with violence in the house of a woman, added with reports of domestic violence and possession of a drunk weapon, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries in part, D.C. supports the challenge of a new policy of greed
Eighteen member states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that rejects harassment for victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence.
The trial of 18 member states and districts sent a friend-of-the-court letter on Friday in Washington to support suitors against the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of Grace v. In the session's challenge called American Civil Liberties Union in August has not yet been disclosed to federal policy.
He said his partner "and his son who was a cruel gang member," had offended him, but the U.S. officials refused his appeal on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The country's power to support Grace depicts El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produces a huge number of larks for the United States, as a country that faces major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new policy of the U.S. retreats with the decision of the Immigration Council in 2014 that allowed dark immigrants who fled from domestic violence to appeal for harassment.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "was ignoring the laws of the state, the federal, and the international that have been in existence for several decades."
"Federal law insists that all allegations of fraud must be decided on the basis of certain facts and conditions related to the claim, and that prohibition violates the principles," the friend-of-the-court letter said.
Further proof gives a brief opinion that the policy that refuses to enter the U.S. economy has lost its economy, says that they are likely to become an entrepreneur and "including the necessary labour force."
Chief Jeff Sessions, in June, the immigration judge ordered that victims who fled from domestic violence and gang violence be stopped.
"They are available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or social group membership, or certain political opinions," Sessions said in this policy announcement on June 11.
It's not meant to ease all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue in Palu because of a double sacrifice running in time to find a survivor
For those who survive, the situation is getting worse.
"It was a great relief," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calmed her boys who were safe in the middle of the ruined town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes bringing the body.
Water is very rare."
The people are looking back at their ruined homes, taking things that are buried in the water, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and treated at the hospital, the damage caused by a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake was devastating.
Some of them were wounded, including the two Haris, who suffered bone and shoulder fractures, lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the room because of a severe convulsions.
Her eyes flow as she recounts her feelings again when the earthquake opened the five-bedroom hotel room where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
"It's not easy to save yourself.
I think I'm involved in a wall collapse," Haris told the Associated Press, he added his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry, please, and then shut up.
I didn’t know what was happening to me and my son.
May they be safe."
The U.S. Army accuses Cheongkok of 'intimidating' with 'advertising advertising'
A week after Tiongkok's official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement on a U.S. day that mentioned the profits of the US-Tiongkok trading team, the U.S. high court for Tiongkok accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
The president of the U.S.A. Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a supplement payment of China’s Daily in Des Moines Register - a press release in the state of Iowa - after Tiongkok accused Tiongkok of trying to interfere with the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, a charge filed by Tiongkok.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to join the U.S. election, which marks what the U.S. office says to Reuters, is a new phase in the expansion of Washington's campaign to push Tigkok.
Although something is common for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington are stuck in an ever-increasing trade war, which has led them to increase the rate of imports among themselves.
The price of Tikongkok's compensation at the beginning of this trade war was designed to attack exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, says Tikongkok and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the great US ambassador for Tigkok and former governor-in-chief of Iowa, export major farm goods to Tigkok, says Beijing has lost workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tongkok, Branstad wrote an opinion at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now exacerbates the intimidation by running a advertisement on our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Tiongkok government has taken advantage of the tradition of freedom of speech and that of the press that is highly appreciated in the Americas by placing a pay ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the kiosks of the street newspaper here, in Beijing, you will find a limitation on different voices and will not see the actual ceremony on the different opinions that may be held by the Tincocks about the difficult economic journey, in memory of the media under the control of the Tincock Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in Tigkok refused offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
A Warning Review — A Republican Party Avoids Women’s Elections Over Time With a Kavanaugh Disaster
Because the shadow of the important people on the Republican Party standing and defending the leadership of the Great Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a return attack, especially from women, at the general election of the next half-time.
The emotion of this problem is very high, and most members of the Republican Party have already shown that they want to move forward on the roll.
It can't be denied," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected the senator's move (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake at the end of minutes to do an FBI investigation would be enough to slow down his anger on the election.
"Won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior counselor and jury speaker for the progressive MoveOn group said on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "November is near!" when they performed a demonstration at the Senate hall when the Republic Party controlled the Judicial Committee to continue progressing in the Kavanaugh appeal, released from the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will emerge from the list," political analyst Stu Rothenberg said to the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among the women's voters in the lower polling and election areas, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even before Ford’s public witnessing, which specifically explained sexual harassment against him by the Supreme Court’s ruling, the analysis suggests that there would be a subsequent attack if the Republican Party continued to push him to advance with confirmation.
"This is a mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republic, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election of the committee or the election of the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the stand, it's also about how the Republic Party manages this problem and how they do it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose a Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
But the Americans would seem to be divided about who to be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more supportive choice to the last.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents really believe in or perhaps believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they really believe or maybe believe in Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After moving from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under an oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh, who was drunk, had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the High Court's chalon showed him his affection when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
Web Browsers World Wide Web Scheduled to Start New Internet to Meet Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, a World Wide Web inventor, launched a Facebook, Amazon, and Google launch.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open-source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and whoever is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the start.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to create "personal online data storage" or their own POD.
This storage can include a list of contacts, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the online storage of this personal data is that it really depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
In the company it's known as "personal intelligence through data."
The idea to build Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company has the right resources, processes, and skills to help solids be available to everyone.
Now this company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some staff development that is opposed to project work, and a code-maker volunteer community.
Beginning this week, technology development around the world can make the decentralization application itself using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a total change where all their business models would really be reversed last night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post in the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has become a voice that has an impact on the neutrality of the network debate.
Even when the Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the Director and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: World Cup WW1 Victoria Cross
The only mayor of the Church in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was remembered in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, for the Berlin and Lehaucourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a junta shooter and never knew that he had won the highest military award in England.
A warning stone directed by his two grandchildren at a paradise in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "scientific symbol" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of Grandfather's achievement won his gratitude.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "to extract a very heavy straw under a firefight from the field and machine guns."
Then he rushes forward to the time line and with "greater courage" leads the front line before he rushes using his own field weapon and releases three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says his grandfather's action is "something I know I can't live but it's a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very pleased to be in this paradise" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give."
MMA fans spent the night watching Bellator 206, but they also got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've spent the night watching Bellator 206 full-time just to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's shop has 13 fights, including six on the main cards and is being screened directly all night in England at Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., right when the Ggard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's faces, the audience in England was shocked when his lips turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they arrive to this special day for the fight.
A Twitter fan describes an exchange of children's cartoons as a "sweet joke."
"This is the rule of the government, that at 6 p.m. the content is not appropriate to be displayed, so that it is replaced by the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior president of the census and the Bellator communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa's dad," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they'd improve their schedule by counting the audience in England in the coming time.
"Instruct me, if we think about the replay, I think we might be able to complete it," said Coker.
"But right now there at six o'clock in the morning and we're not going to be able to fix it until the Sunday of our time, the Monday of their time.
But we are doing our best.
Trust me, at the time of the change, there's a lot of back-to-back text and everything doesn't teach.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, that will never happen again.
We're going to reduce to only five fights from six fights -- as we usually do -- and we're going to try to avoid excessive temptation for fans, and we're going to succeed.
It's unfavourable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'weak' related to sexuality
The Olympic explorer Tom Daley said he grew up feeling low because of his sexuality -- but it gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize it until he went to high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also says that being an old man makes him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The usual concert conductor brought this long walk, Kirsty Young, taking off for a few months because of the pain.
Looks like the evicted people on the first Laverne program, Daley said he felt "less than" all the other people who grew up with him because "not what can be socially accepted to like men and women."
He said, “This day you have lost all respect, and you have lost all respect for me.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let everyone know when they knew about his sexuality problem.
The two medals of the Olympics have become the famous LGBT campaign jurors and used their appearance at Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he was talking because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The world's champion three times said he fell in love with a moviemaker from the US Dustin Lance Black, who was found in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley married Oscar, who is 20 years older than she was last year, and she said she's not a problem at all.
"When you have so many problems at a very young age"--he followed his first Olympice at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who had the same e-mail.
This couple has become an old man in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you ask me last year, all the same 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than just winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had got a ticket to the London Olympics 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit on the front row of your father," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he wasn't defeated," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the competition.
"What I know is, this is what I've been focusing on all my life--to drown in front of the crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - that has joined him in his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him faint.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mikkelson changed his role when proposed on Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Officer Phil Mickelson will record the record on Sunday when he played the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to change his role to avoid unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played the two-year event to record the 12th record, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for the game four balls and groups four on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually did for the United States, the main winner this five times divided his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that stage, with hope to fix what made him trouble.
Never become the most direct golfer at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man doesn't fit to follow a very strict course at Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and harsh sentences for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not scary enough for Mikkelson, in a nine-day game on Sunday, to face the very exact English champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with the new arrival Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American player starts 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then Mikkelson will prove very important.
Fury expressed his confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understands his role today, turns his back and embraces me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He so trusted himself.
He's Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team last week, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined the others, but that was the way they played, and that was the way we thought we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that would never match the size of his individual record.
Mickelson played 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven series, although Furyk said that his presence brought some things he could not say on the team.
"She's funny, she's tough, she's a girl, she likes to joke about people, and she's a cool guy in the team room," she explained.
"I think the younger player is having fun with her, too, this week, which is pretty fun to see.
He's given a lot of things, more than playing."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great superiority can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, Captain of Europe, learned from experience that a man who led quite a large way to his last single match at Ryder Cup could easily become an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 game in Valderrama, with the captain of the Seve Ballesteros team holding five points over America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the slightest margin, winning 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get great superiority in Valderrama; we get great superiority in Brooklyn, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but just," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching Class of 2018, won 5-3 well on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring game.
Get out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get the points on the writing board.
We have a target, and the target is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying for a long time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
Glad to see the players playing in the hard golf field, Bjorn added, "In this case I will never make my own progress.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the individual player will move forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a friend if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to tell all the players, get the best out of yourself for the game tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he must go to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his player to play better individually than they did as a couple, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
The force itself has been on the two ends of the last round of the great game day, has been part of the team that won in Brooklyn before the end of the defeat of Europe by performing the "Miracles in the Medina."
"I remember every word," he said, answering the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start it fast as you see in Brooklyn, as you see in Medina.
When the moment goes one way, it'll give you a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We've also arranged a playlist and put people in different ways that we feel, you know, we're trying to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight against Rory McIlroy at the top of the game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players are in the top line.
"I went with this group of people in order like this because I think I can close all the way," said Bjorn about his only choice.
The new German warship is delayed.
The German Navy's latest watchmen were supposed to start in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but it won't be there until at least next year because of the wrong system and its rising cost, local media reports.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" mission, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg guardship, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which is chaired by the military.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the issue of shipping passports had disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The fourth Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship, which was notified to the Navy in 2007, will come as replacement for an old Bremen class guard.
This ship will be equipped with a strong tanker, a series of anti-aircraft mines, and anti-shipship mines, as well as some advanced technologies, such as radar removal, infrared, and acoustic keys.
Other important features include the longer periods of treatment that would have allowed the modern - day Watch Tower to be used for two years far from its original port.
However, the detention continuously means this high warship -- which is said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad -- will be delayed at the beginning of its mission time, The Time noted.
Bad lucky F125 patrol ship was announced last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss bay in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to its shipyard after its shipment.
Only a few reasons are known behind the ship's return, but the German media refers to a number of "hardware and hardware failure" that makes the warship useless when used for the war mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by a ship consisting of 120 sailors - only half of the work force on the older Bremen class.
It is also known that the ship’s boats are far too much to reduce its power and limit the capacity of the Navy to add to the update at the coming time.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bobot is twice as heavy as the German class used in World War II.
In addition to broken hardware, the cost of production of the whole project — including ship training — is also a problem.
It's said that it's up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) -- up from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problem with the modern guardship has become very important to keep in mind the latest warning because of the imposition of sanctions on the power of the German Navy.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy actually "ends of the ship with the ability to spread."
The officer said that the time of this problem is growing, because old ships are no longer used, but there are no replacement ships available.
He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class guards can join the Navy.
National Trust listens secretly to the secret life of the cubs
A recent research has been carried out at a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aimed at revealing how the gallows use natural habitats in their food hunts.
It is expected that this finding will give new light to the behavior of this unique flying mammals and will help guide conservation activities at the coming time.
This study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow the general, soprano pipistrelle and long-acting chocolate and Daubenton in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
The special sequence will be placed in the main location around the property to track the event during the summer.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile surveillance using a hose detector.
The sound specialist who analyzes all the recordings will ensure the frequency of the call and the species doing what activity.
The maps and habitat reports will then be designed to make images with a detailed scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes this result will reveal which habitat area is most important for the deaf and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine the benefits of the habitat management work such as the production of vegetation and the best way to preserve forests and other related species.
The populace in Scotland and throughout England has fallen sharply in the last few centuries.
It was threatened by the construction and development of the tunnel that affected the interior and lost its habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as stick paper hung to trap the hatchery and chemical treatment of the building, as well as attacks by the insect.
It's not really a blind man.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears were more useful than his eyes in catching victims.
They're using high-end gem location techniques to find insects right on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land across the country, is of great concern to the floodwaters.
Having ten trained men, who regularly surveyed, internalized, and sometimes tried to save.
This organization has also set up the first and only natural waters in Scotland at the Thrave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species in Scotland.
David Thompson's farm manager said the farm was a suitable area for the gallows.
"Here at Thrave, we have a good area for the darkness," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about the eclipse, so the work we're doing here and in other properties will help us get more aware of what they need to grow."
He stressed the importance of checking the ovaries before doing maintenance in the property, because without realizing the possibility of the destruction of one ovaries could kill up to 400 ovaries and still small ovaries, which might destroy the entire local population.
It is an illegal act to protect, kill, torture, or disrupt the life of a loved one.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s Preservation of Trust, has moved the public to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about our cubs and for many of our species we don't know how their population's fate is."
Ronaldo, who rejects the charge of rape, is preparing a lawyer for the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the claim of self-defense as "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer would demand the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the charge.
The Portuguese and Juventus were accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later supposed to have paid him by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Talking in an Instagram News video to 142 million disciples a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, threatening the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," the winner of Ballon d'Or five times said it to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's the usual thing.
They want to be known by calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Prosecutor Ronaldo is preparing to challenge Der Spiegel for the charge, which they call a "suspect report in the field of unacceptable privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz lawyer said he would ask for compensation as "a moral loss in the amount appropriate to the severity of the breach, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped him, according to a report sent to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled after the incident was charged and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who disappointed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo allowed both of them to have sex, but it was based on desire together.
Mayorga also said she went to the police office and had made a visa on her injuries at the hospital, but then agreed to settle the case outside the court because she felt "fear to get revenge" and worried that "would be humiliated in front of the public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's constantly having a trauma over the incident that's due.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italia Juve club with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: English 'will regret forever' on the loss of car manufacturers
England "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added Toyota, England has told the BBC that if England leaves the European Union without an agreement, for a while it will stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The original Japanese car maker said that if there was no deal, Brexit would be losing in the job cost.
The factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis production Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"I think it's if English comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's performance in Burnaston.
The other British car producers have expressed their concern about its exit from the European Union without any agreement on how the border trade would go, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close Mini's factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what was said by the car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain if there is no agreement with Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on the basis of the "precisely time" production principle, with a load of load entering every 37 minutes from the British and the European Union for cars made according to the load.
If England leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a disturbance on the border, which, according to industry, could cause congestion and less load.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's supply at his factory in Derbyshire, the word of company administration, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark said the Chequers Theresa May plan to connect with the European Union at the time was "calibrated correctly to avoid border checks."
"We need to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy success at this moment, but for us to get this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio Today program.
"It's not just from Toyota, but also from other producers, that we really need to be able to continue what's already been a very good supply chain."
Toyota can't say how long his production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warning that the cost supplement will reduce the plant's competitive power and eventually lose in the job cost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the director of the United Workers' Association at the factory, said more and more of his concerns: "Because of my experience, so far away this work will never be returned.
The jury said, "We have put together a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union at the coming time."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be retold, the White Building floor.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein can be "recasted once a week" because of the battle of the chief court of Brett Kavanaugh, the White Building said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special advisory work of Robert Mueller, who is investigating the involvement of Russia in public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential to impede justice by the president.
Whether Trump would fire a high-level attorney or not, which would endanger Mueller's freedom, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record talks with Trump and the possibility of facilitating the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objected to that report.
But on the last Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of a report that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he'd "choose for no" to fire Rosenstein, but that meeting was set up again to avoid interference with the Senate justice committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week on the charge of Kavanaugh, which later delayed the full resurgence of the Senate.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, is on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "Despite that meeting is not yet scheduled, it can be this week, I can see that it's going back to the next week also good to remember the other things that happened in the grand court.
But we see it and I always want to give the latest news to the press."
Some reporters will object: Sanders has not held press meetings in the White Building since September 10th.
The director of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders says it's rare that the meetings are not because they don't like TV reporters "who are trying to attract attention," though, he says, "I don't really agree that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press be strengthened.
"The president did more questions directly than the previous president," he added without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen these numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, says Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it more often and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
The trumpet routinely asks questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with high officials.
The solo press conference rarely happened.
This week in New York, the president may be showing his reasons, making his appearance free and sometimes weird before the press gathers.
Health Secretary wrote to European Union workers in NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the staff of the European Union working in the NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope that they will continue to work here after the Brexit problem.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months to England pulling himself from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has committed to meeting the cost of permanent status training for citizens of the European Union who work in the services transferred.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between England and the European Union on this withdrawal continue, nearing the decision expected in this fall season.
However, the British government has also prepared for the possibility that there will be no agreement.
I know this must be very disturbing for you all.
That is why I now want to emphasize how much I deeply appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, left off from their homeland.
Fellows from all over the European Union, and others, have gained valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance health care, and benefit the patients and society we serve.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie Survived Emergency Surgery After Facing Head Damage
Tennesssee State Tigers background, Christian Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after having suffered head injury at 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Coach Head of Tennessee State, Rod Reed said to the injured reporter shortly before the baby's finished.
"He came to the back of the field and fell asleep there," said Reed.
Medical training and strength gave oxygen to Abercrombie in the back of the field before putting it in the den and taking it for further evaluation.
An officer from Tennessee said to Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris adds that "there are no details about the type/level of injury suffered" and the State of Tennessee trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the two-year-old student, was in his first spring with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made him a total of 18 in the summer.
A foreigner will be charged higher material costs if he buys property in England
Foreign buyers will be charged higher material costs when they buy property in England, along with additional money to help the designers in the new Tory Plan.
This step will hold back the progress of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters
The cost of these materials will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in England
The Department of Finance estimates to collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreigners will be wearing a higher mammoth when they purchase property in Britain — including additional money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announces it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to keep the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts in attracting young electors with the promise to provide a more secure and secure home.
The material cost will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that will move the government to fight the waves.
The additional costs are additional to the current material cost, including the higher level identified two years ago at the second house purchase and the purchase of the house to reach three percent.
The Department of Finance expects this move to go up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English residents, who made it more expensive and more difficult for the first buyer to put his feet on the ground floor.
Many rich areas in this country -- usually in the capital -- have become a ghost city because many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called on the money market to help more young people have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of maintaining a high property price by buying land but not using it, and pressured New May to ignore the housing quota to repair the "supply" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of reforms in the area of attractive businesses, including rental surveillance and ending the "without guilt".
He also wanted to give the council greater power to build new homes.
Ms. May said, "I promised last year that I would dedicate myself to the prime minister's office to restore the British dream that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our crazy business market.
English will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in England, as well as a foreign - based company, to buy a home that is easy for those who are already working hard.
For many people dreamt of having a house become a very distant thing, and unbeknownst to the real nature of behavior."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scotland team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross says "main ambition" is to be Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of revitalizing the North-East Club, which currently holds the third level in the 1st League, is three points from the top position.
He moved to the Stage of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last summer.
"I want to beat my country as a player.
I got a B hat and it's him," Ross told Sportssound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and often watching the Scotland team at Hampden with my father as a child, and it's always something that drew me back.
But that chance will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland manager before Ross, among other things, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former boss Alloa Athletic said he didn't feel good to follow the big names in that whole club, after before refusing the offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, the success of this moment will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because the structure and facilities in this club are no longer suspected of being in the Premier League," he said.
"Don't make it easy to be there, but I might just see myself as a successful man here, if I could bring this club back there."
Ross' career in team management was only three years, after some time as a boss assistant in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a training staff in Hearts.
And then he helped Alloa recover from the degradation to the third position, and turn St. Mirren from the degradation barrier into the winner of the championship in the next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"This may be a road crossing I have to go through," he recalls when he took over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds really weird because I'm okay, looking for a decent way to make a living, and enjoying some good things.
But playing can be difficult.
A lot of things you have to spend every week.
I'm still experiencing it in the matter of working pressure, but in the management it feels good.
I always want to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable thing I've ever felt in my adult life."

Survey found, the right time to drink beer is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has increased public income in England fighting to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
The figures show that the audience and the bar saw sales of 2.7 percent in July — but income of 4.8 percent in the restaurant.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who compiled these figures, said: "The bright day and British participation in the World Cup longer than expected, July will follow the same pattern as in the previous month of June, where public income increases by 2.8 percent, except for a restaurant that receives severe relief.
The trade in restaurants down to 1.8 percent in June will get worse in July.
Public and bar sales selling drinks so far show the strongest of what happened at the restaurant down.
The public who sell food also suffers from the heat of the sun, although it does not separate the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just out for a drink.
Sales all over the pub and the bar selling drinks up to 6.6 percent for this month, with three percent selling food."
Paul Newman, a recreation analyst and RSM hotel, says, "This has been on the train we've seen since April.
The weather and effects of social events or sports remain the biggest factor in the sale of markets outside the home.
Not surprisingly, a group of restaurants continues to fight to survive, although sales of 4.8 percent a year to year will be very painful over the current cost pressure.
The long hot season should not come at the time of the operator selling food in bad times, and the time will tell you whether the good enough temperature we enjoyed in August will give you some needed rest."
Total sales growth throughout the public and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, is 2.7 percent in July, showing the bridge on the launch of the brand.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales survey for the pub, bar, and restaurant in England collects and analyzes film data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion, and is an industry gap that can no longer be reached.
One of the five children has a secret social media account they hide from their parents.
Survey revealed, one of the five children - some of whom are 11 years old - have a secret social media account they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the fake Insta page.
This report has raised concerns about posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account to show their parents
One of five children is still 11 years old — making social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a "False Insta" account growth -- a reference to a photo-sharing site in Instagram.
That report has raised the anxiety of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate a "main" account that's been cleared to show parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked others to "force me."
Research conducted by the English Digital Association and the Men's University Conference and the Women's School (HMC) from independent schools found 40 percent of students 11 to 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping a personal account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "This has disturbed so many young children that they try to create an online space that their parents and teachers can't find."
Elid Doyle will be "a voice for the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics.
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Chamber as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is a ski athlete and the most respected Scottish field, and the leader of Ian Beattie describes this movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the field of sport to benefit from his various experiences at international level for the past few decades.
"Eilid is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we are sure athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the hall," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I acted as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
American athletes, who won a 200 - foot [200 m] race and 400 - foot [400 m] race at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta between the total four gold medals of the Olympics and now become this BBC expert, are now unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He writes on Twitter: "This month I suffered strokes.
I can't walk.
The doctor says only the time that can determine if I can recover and to the extent that he recovers.
It is a very difficult job to recover completely, to learn again how to walk, and today to practice the subject!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
A breast pump advertisement that compares mother to cow has split opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has shared views in the online world with an advertisement that compares the mother to the cow being washed.
To mark the launch of a product called "a breast pump that can be used with the first silence in the world," the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ad inspired by sexual music video to show the freedom given this new pump to express a mother.
Four moms danced in a cave full of straw and followed a song that distinguished the lyrics like this: "Yes, I'm shaking myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice this isn't black, it's my breast."
And it goes on with the refrain, "Earth pump, out pump, I feed them, out pump, out pump, out pump, I suck my daughter's milk."
However, advertisements published on this company's Facebook page have led to online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a mixed response from the mirror, with many who say it makes the "power" in the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision using cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows should also be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby was stolen from them in a few days after giving birth," said someone.
The Elvie breast pump is very fit in BH following (Elvie/Mbu)
Another comment: "A trauma that can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why don't you use it to advertise breast pumps for the mother to keep her baby?"
And others say, "This is an empty announcement."
The other person defended the advertisement, with a woman admitting that she found the song "slow."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'll buy it if I still have it.
It makes me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I got it.
It's a brilliant product," wrote someone.
And some of them say: "This is a good news for those whose mothers are barren and who feel like cows."
It's not an advertisement that commends or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps inside their arms.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the surveillance of many women who spy on ASI who say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is really thin, without cable or rope and passage in the bra followed, giving women freedom to move, touching their babies, and even going out as they crawled.
Ana Balarin, a teammate and ECD at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is a product that deserves to be launched with conviction and provocative.
By comparing the image between expressing women and cows our desire to pump ASI and all its challenges, and showing it through how to comfort and enjoy the full freedom that new pumps offer.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump was the main news.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother with two children was on the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Move Quietly to the Tent Camp in the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained is increasing even though the monthly border crossings are still unchanged, most of the consequences of the harsh statements and policies introduced by Trump's government that are difficult to support children with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are non-documentary immigrants, and fear of endangering their own ability to stay in that country by making progress to save children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that the sponsors and other adult members of the house had to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer in the field of Immigration and Bea Cukai, testified in front of the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor children under the age of the desert.
The Foundation then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested had no history of criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of those who become sponsors or members of the sponsor's group are illegal in this country, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process the children faster, the officers introduced a new order that required some of them to attend the court within a period of one month after being arrested, not after 60 days, which became a previous standard, said the shelter worker.
Most of them appear through video conference calls, not directly, to ask for their legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who were considered unworthy of receiving help would be deported directly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to get worried or depressed, so as to increase their violence or to escape, the workers of the shelter and the system report received in the last few months.
The lawyers said that the anxiety increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, which signs of a child struggling tends to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving children to a camp town without giving them enough time to get them emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends can spread much trauma.
Syria asked the United States, France and Turkey to return immediately.
Arriving in the U.S. General Majesty, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked the Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as prime minister, said that foreign troops were illegally occupying Syria's land, for reasons of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with in full."
"They must retreat as soon as and without making any demands," his expression to the lodger.
Moualem stressed that "war on terror almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million refugees from their homes.
He stressed that Damascus would continue to "commit this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of the terrorist group and "the presence of an illegal foreign army."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, especially training and influencing the Kurdish and Syrian Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war zone.
With regard to refugee problems, Moualem stressed that they should be back soon, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "extraordinary fears" that motivated refugees to go further.
"We have asked the international community and the human organization to facilitate this past," he said.
"They're policing what should be the problem of total humanity."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition ended the war.
The U.S. diplomats said the most recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the great castle of the Idlib rebels has given the last opportunity to continue political talks.
A deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack from the Syrian army supported by Russia in that province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem stressed that the treaty had a "clear date" and gave rise to the despair that military action would target scholars including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would "be slaughtered."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hoped to speed up the first meeting of the new committee of government and opposition members to make the War-Laws for Syria and open the way to a public election.
Moualem set out the requirements of the Syrian government's agreement in the committee, stressing that the work of the panel should be limited to "to review the latest legal clauses," and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020 except for the many liberal viewers who hope, the prosecution and scandal to end his presidency today.
No one doubted, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever existed!"
So far, there's no sign of fatigue for the viewers.
Since 2014, the CNN's main shift clock has increased more than twice as much to 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly three times as much to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has hosted the top levels of cable TV with 3.5 million viewers on the main news night.
"This is a spirit that makes people interested in being something that is not yet understood," says Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths Going Into Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He remembered taxis in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give his voice to Trump.
Why?
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said to me.
There is the value of entertainment in a troublesome situation.
Of course, unlike other TV events, the news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can reunite and restore the global economy.
In turn, a privilege that can only be felt by the most special viewer.
In this regard, not just being a citizen of a known state at six o'clock you found yourself watching the panel of experts debate the use of the "backdrop" source Bob Woodward for his book called "Fare," wearing a bird's leather jacket for Paul Manafort's $15,000 worth of clothes with pride," The Washington Post, and the implications of the terrible description of Stormy Daniels on Trump anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"The part of the politics that he does makes it the same as a real event that comforts you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and created "Pawn Stars," about the performance scene player and Trump's daily story (choose to enemy with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

A lot of money from outside won the election contests with the strongest time in the White House
Pennsylvania 17 was the only one who got the cash flow, the blessings of repatriating the Congressional District, which provided two survivors in the same session.
The Pittsburg District recently re-established, calling Conor Lamb from Rep. The Democrats -- who won the seats in the other districts through a special summer election last year.
The lamb has advanced against another fugitive, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12 - year - old district of Pennsylvania, with its new 17th district.
These maps were re set after the General Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally on the side of the Republic party.
Competition in the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in a great deal of campaign money between the large party's financial side, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The lamb is now known in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the Maret special election that was held for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The course has been held by the Republican Party office for over a decade, and President Donald Trump wins the district with 20 points.
The political experts sent the Democratic party a little higher.
A.S. Balanced the punishment of El Salvador for supporting the Chef, and then back.
Diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama had accepted Beijing, giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama until the team expelled the Trump Management Team.
The Department of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a departmental jury, made a statement earlier this month.
However, punishment was considered only for El Salvador, who received assistance of some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development support, and economics.
The court, which covers the payment of financial assistance and visa restrictions, will hurt the Central American state and will rise to the level of unemployment and murder.
When the internal meeting took place, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to attend the same year that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials stressed that they wanted to continue the conference, to effectively end the review for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at that conference, this time scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal by the government at the near end of the year, the representatives of diplomats.
And the third American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new counsel or severe punishment from Washington.
A White Building juror for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on details of the debate presented by the third U.S. office, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consideration of this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by external analysts who were close to the government and spoke about these inconceivable conditions.
Study Edition
Another surprising story is a special advisor's report by Robert Mueller on the possibility that Mr. Trump's trial would be remanded, which is now very important in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discussed his investigation into whether Trump's campaign was collaborating with Russia in an attack on our public elections.
When the Congress moves, Mr. Trump will be called upon to assume responsibility for himself, as soon as he is ready to go back to the electorate, and may eventually become a jury of his fellowmen.
That's why there's still a lot to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's reign cannot be avoided or reduced in Europe.
There's a better choice for us to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, Germany’s officials were ready to take a stand against Hitler, had the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years that followed.
The beginnings of history have centered on the point of such a change, and the speed of democracy or imprisonment cannot be avoided.
Today, the United States faces a number of such changes.
What should we do if Trump fired Officer General Rod Rosenstein, the one who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then reports that, last year, he suggested that he secretly record the president and think he does not deserve the president's office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was wrong.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation that has just been requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he has been referred to the Supreme Court if there is a strong charge of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time voice to Congress that will demand Trump's responsibility?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will continue to deteriorate in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who had established my great empire.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to burn the candles on the table that wrote the toilet.
By leaving that legacy to me, how did I lose my hope for our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feel optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are offering Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning over Austria, following a good score in Spain against Villareal early this month, will strengthen their position to get away from the Group of the G League of Europeans.
The knee injury made a slip in the middle of Graham Dorrans can't be seen in this first season until the result of score 2-2 against Villareal, but he's sure Rangers can take advantage of it as a stone to greater hope.
"This point is very good for us because Villareal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go by playing one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it, but we think the results may be fair.
In the first chapter, they may look better, but in the second, we get up and become a better team.
By Friday, tonight is another great day in Europe.
We hope to be able to raise three points even though it will be a difficult match because they have good results in their last match, but, with support behind us, I'm sure we can keep moving forward and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because what happened to my injuries and changes in that club itself, but now there's a very good hope in this club.
It's a good squad and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good training.

Although it turns out that surveyors have a dirty idea of how they want to be treated, there are not many people who have talked to their family about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide study discussed long-term care costs with their mates.
Just 10 percent of them say they're talking about this with their kids.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, president of the National Life Insurance Business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family to take care unless you tell your wishes first.
Language with your family’s advisers, where and how you get treatment, because the choice you make will mean a lot more important in determining the cost.
Give your financial advice: Your advisers can certainly help you by showing you how to pay for those expenses.
The services you choose for long-term care include traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or assures yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: In the face of a legal dispute.
Immediately show power for your health care, someone you believe to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professionals when you cannot communicate.
On the other hand, the letter of power in your financial matters should also be considered.
Someone who trusts to manage all your financial decisions you have to choose, except to make sure you pay your bill if you can't.
Always remember with every little detail: Imagine when your aging parents are in an emergency health condition and on their way to the hospital.
Are you prepared to answer a number of questions about treatment or allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man was shot with a gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a gun on his way home from a night party.
Those 40-year-old victims were in the area of Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots were fired about his chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting event was described by the officer as happening around 02:30 BST, and was said to be "accident."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim did not threaten his soul, and a number of witnesses have been reported by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis over Indonesia
Earthquakes and tsunamis were so intense against the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, that only a few 384 souls were killed, the number of officers, and the number of deaths expected to increase.
It was decided that the communication made officers who provided trouble relief to get information from the Doggala Republic, a region on the north side of the town of Palu which is closer to the centre of the earthquake that hit with the power of 7.5 Richter scale.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of main facts about the cities of Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the narrow edge of the island's west coast, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
In the meantime, Dodakla is a vast population of more than 300 km (180 miles) from the shoreline on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This population, which is the administrative region under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
The economic eyes of the South Sulawesi province are looking for fish and matching plants, especially on the coasts of the Dongal.
However, the presence of nickel development is also important in this province, although most of it is located in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
recorded in the last 100 years, the Palu and the Dongala have been subjected several times to tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Management Board.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in tsunamis and hundreds of homes in the city of Dongala.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami in the western part of the world.
In a seismic way, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Cincinn and therefore the earthquakes will occur in an orderly manner.
A number of shocks and big tsunamis that have lasted for the last few years are as follows:
The year 2004: 26 December, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, right on the west coast of the province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also led to tsunami in 14 countries, to the end of 226,000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the victims died in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, a violent storm struck the west coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, off the Sumatran coast, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: The 6,8 - magnitude earthquake hit south Java, the worst island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis on the south coast and resulting in nearly 700 deaths.
2009: The city’s capital, West Sumatra, was devastated by the power of 7.6 in the vicinity of Padang.
The victims are more than 1,100 people.
2010: One island on the island of Mantawai, in the south of Sumatra, was also hit by a 7,5 - strong earthquake that triggered a tsunami of up to 20 feet (10 m) in length, ravaging ten villages and killing some 300 people.
2016: Pdie Jaya, Aceh, a native of the Republic, also suffered shocks and resulting in destruction, as well as the horrors of people who remembered the devastating effects of earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
Although this time there is no tsunami, more than 100 people have died because of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, which is considered a tourist island, has also suffered a devastating earthquake that kills more than 500 people, most of whom are on the north side of the island.
The earthquake robbed thousands of buildings and threw thousands of tourists away.
Palin’s firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for president, has been arrested with a suit of assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, obstructed domestic violence and opposed efforts to arrest, such as a report by the Alaskan National Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report any suspicion of crime, she grabbed the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to the Mat-Su Praparadilan Prison, with $500 indemnity, as reported by the KTUU.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, stating himself "not guilty, confident" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three minor Class A violations, which could put him in prison for a year and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with the claim of Class B, with the penalty of one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, this is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, who contacted the police to report the attack.
The case is now referred to the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was called upon to pursue domestic violence, to prevent reports of domestic violence, and to control the possession of firearms in a drunken state, which was also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of looking at his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was threatened by a group of veterans who continued to associate her son’s violence with PTSD as a result of his work in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was struck by a terrible earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
The 7,5 Richter scale that has the potential to trigger tsunamis has forced thousands of homes to be demolished.
The electricity grid and communication connections are broken, and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
Earthquakes were at that time hitting Sulawesi in the middle, which lay east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Video-videos showing how intense the moments of the disaster went through social media.
Hundreds of middle-aged people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke down the beach.
The federal prosecutor tried to get a rare death sentence to suspect a terrorist attack at NYC.
The federal prosecutor in New York tried to get a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- that sentence was rare and has not been done in the country of the federal crime in question since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, was expected to do an attack by hitting a truck he hired from Home Depot on foot and a bicycle driver on a bike along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to allow this death penalty, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intelligently" caused a serious injury to the body, on the basis of a statement of intent to bring down the death penalty, to the South New York District.
On the basis of the court’s documents, the two charges allowed the death penalty to be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury seized Saipov with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in investigating torture, which was usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, as well as charges of violence and attempting to damage the motor vehicle.
According to the prosecutor, the attack requires "substantial planning and early development," as a depiction of Saipov's crime committed with "worse, cruel, and unscrupulous."
Said in a statement of intent, "Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims of the incident were native tourists from Argentina.
Counted one decade since the South New York District dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, charged with the murder of two drug addicts, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last execution of the death sentence at the New York federal court in 1953, was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were convicted of conspiracy espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed with the power station on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of his court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not show how sorry he was for the day and month after the attack.
When questioned by the investigator, he said that he was pleased with what he had done, the police presence.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that the attack he made was inspired by the video ISIS that was watched from his phone, like the statement.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, the police station.
He stated that he was innocent of 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" about the prosecution's decision.
"In our view, the decision to execute death rather than receive a request for guilt for life imprisonment without a guarantee of release will only lengthen the trauma of the people involved in the incident," Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team had asked the prosecutor not to put a death sentence on them.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit's negotiations, Tory MP says.
Nigel Farage called for 'crowding the population' today in a prosthetic action at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians should feel 'hot' Eurosceptics -- because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that they be involved in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Group Support, Peter Bone, told road action in Birmingham that England 'should be out' right now if Farage served as Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by May in reconciling his shared position has been undermined by Remain Tories supporters who join in separate protest actions threatening Brexit in that city.
Prime Minister fought to defend the Chequers compromise plan to remain on its way even though in the middle of the Brexiters, Remainers and the European Union.
The partners stressed that he would be moved to reach agreement with Brussels, even though he had a bad back-up reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Job to decide the choice between his source package and the 'disquiet' package.
Bone told the Left Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to remove the Cheques.
The example, that Farage should point out to his colleagues to be given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If the officer's answer stays with him, we'll be out now," he said.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough said, "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
His expression, he just showed his opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight in the world's war to be subdued.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone notes that the public opinion has been able to bring about changes since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the English people's thinking has changed and wanted a regular condition, it's not true at all."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in that mass action, posted to the reporter: 'Simply, I want you to say, Mr. Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular in the public, but the opposition will not choose it, because they are not popular with our parties and our activists who really went down the road and made us selected in the first position.
Our request, remove the Chequers and start listening to us.'
And by a messenger, he said, “The Minister will defend their work when they have made a solemn promise.”
Farage said that political demonstrations had to be thwarted in order to "sympathize with the heat" if they wanted to violate the 2016 referendum decision.
"Now the most precious thing is belief among us -- our people and our political people," he said.
And they said unto them, We will not leave you here this day, because they have forsaken Brexit, and here we are.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic society: 'I want you to make our political people, who are prepared to disobey Brexit, also feel its heat.
"We are moving the troops of this country that will conquer us in Brexit and never give up until the British is in power, self-ruled, and proud."
Meanwhile, the remnants moved through Birmingham before calling for action in the city center for two hours.
Activist lines appear to spread the Tories Against Brexit after launching the line at the end of this week.
Fellows in the line of work, Lord Adonis, mock the Conservative group on the security issues of their party's application when the conference opens.
"These are the people who told us that they can control the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of anti-freedom, free trade in Ireland," he recovered.
"It's a funny show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' it heals.
Warren planned to do 'serious break' in the president's quest
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was going to "break the president's strike" after the election date in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party announced its future at the city hall in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who was often harassed by President Donald Trump, recommended re-election in November against the state GOP's GOP administration, Geoff Diehl, the leader of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was marked as a Trump opponent in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was the 36th with his electors, which was marked with city hall format since Trump was working.
An actor asked him if there was any plan to challenge himself as president.
Warren replied, "This is the right time for a woman to enter the Washington Circle to restore our corrupt government, and that includes the time of the woman's residence on the top."
He's captured by Sims shooters, LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced his arrest suspect was shot to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m. at the ET press conference.
They filmed a shooting on Friday, where an identified man asked for help as seen in the recording.
On Friday morning, Sims, 20 years old, was shot and found dead near Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul, told the media on Saturday, through 247 sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of things, holding firearms, and shooting him toward Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a fight and imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with six feet high, grew up in Baton Rouge, that's Sims, has played in 32 matches with 10 early in the past season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 football in each match.
Grand Prix boy in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world's title after the team acknowledged his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear when the Bottas Valteri was in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday's qualifications that would bring the Mercedes team's command to play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton because he defended his position in the first two rounds and attracted Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel became the first to go into the pit and let Hamilton move into the cave at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very determined.
Mercedes entered one sheet after and out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued on after a few follow-up actions that showed the driver's access to the Ferrari left the part in the blank with the risk of surviving after a double move to survive on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started starting at the back of the grid and was in the seventh position at the end of the first November at his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race because he held a ban replacement to plan a quick settlement and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth position.
He finally got into the pit in the 44th but couldn't increase his step in the eight remaining leaves because Raikkonen finally took fourth position.
It was a difficult day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
Team has done an amazing job to have one two," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein in a newspaper on Saturday through his village, he did not throw a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about sexual violence against Judge Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a script in West Virginia, the president did not directly present a statement made by Ford before the Senate's Tradition Committee, but instead commented on what was going on in the play that showed people who were "slow and unscrupulous and dishonest."
"Something can happen and the beautiful thing is happening for the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and evil and insanity and dishonesty," he said.
"When you look at the compliments and the kisses and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you fire her?
Remember the answer... did you fire the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't throw it away."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we fire... no, we didn't fire it," plus, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter that contained charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it had been fired earlier in September - but Feinstein objected to that failure not coming from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's accusation, I'm not throwing up his story," Feinstein said to the committee, said Hill.
"He asked me to hide it and I kept it as a secret as his request."
But the opposition seems to be unconfirmed by the president, who commented during a line on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's a very bad language of the body.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst language I've ever seen."
Further his defense against the High Judge, who was accused of sexual harassment against three women, the president was impressed with the democratic view that the charges were used for their own sake.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see wickedness, satisfaction, they don't care who they're sick, who they have to walk to get power and surveillance," Mediaite's report on the president's speech.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer printed two goals for Giants when faced with Dundee
Dundee Stars won a victory on Friday at the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning a field game with a score of 5-3 on Saturday.
Giant got two goals first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the housekeepers to a level before Dwyer returned the giants.
Francois Bouchard compared his position to Dundee before two goals Lucas Lundvald Nielsen won their victory.
That's the defeat of the elite three years ago by Adam Keefe, who was able to pursue exile and finally won to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
That was the fourth meeting this summer between the two sides, with three giants winning in the previous match.
The opening of Dwyer was attended in the fourth minute at 3:35 from the bait given by Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford giving the bait when Beauvillier succeeded in winning four minutes later.
During a thick opening period, Sullivan brought the housekeeper back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the bait supplier for the balance done by Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants prevailed at the time of the first war when the two night goals ran out at the end of the first period.
Homeowners return and Bouchard rebalanced their position with the goal of power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give priority to Dundee for the first time at the end of the second match and he made sure to win with his team in mid-five during the final period.
Giants, who have now suffered four defeats from their five matches, are in the camp to face Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
The Air Force then left to secure hundreds of passengers on a blessed plane from the earthquake.
A driver passed an airship in Indonesia to escape as a hero after his death when he made sure a plane that brought hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died in the world and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake over the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering the tsunami.
A strong storm continued to strike the region and many trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But according to his colleagues, a 21-year-old man, Anthony Gunawan the Great refused to leave his post at a driver's tower that exploded in Sis Al Jufri Mutiara, Palu.
He chose to stand by to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air Flight was then on the runway, could safely take off the runway.
He then jumped out of the driver's tower and crossed when he felt the tower began to fall.
He died after he was in the hospital.
The jury spoke to the Service Navigation Bureau of Indonesia, Johannes Sirier, about the decision that can save hundreds of lives, reports from the news of ABC Australia.
We made a helicopter from Balakpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost track this morning before the helicopter got to the Palu.
"We're all sorry to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities worried about the death of the victim could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Board had made it difficult to access the city of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"Sacrifice assured will continue to increase because of the many bodies of victims that are still in ruins and many others that cannot be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The volume of the six-metre wave has caused the Palu to rise and cause mass funerals on Sunday.
Airplanes carrying military and commercial assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance carries a body.
Clean water became rare.
Minimarkets everywhere in history"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Flag in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Flag is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's been a tragedy, but maybe it's getting worse."
Indonesia President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Ready?" CNN report.
In the early part of this year, Indonesia was also hit by a bomb in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian aircraft accident: Water Niugini reported a missing person after an accident
The airline operated a plane that crashed into the Pacific basin in Micronesia and reported that one person had disappeared, after being previously reported to 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Water Niugini reported on Saturday afternoon, unable to identify a man as a passenger.
The company said the company had worked with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The company does not respond quickly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats help rescue passengers along with other crews, after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The company reported six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the order of events still remain unclear.
Societies and the U.S. Navy both said they were landing at a well around the runway.
Some of the witnesses felt that the plane was overpassing the runway.
U.S. citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him and the others that he had been able to cross the high water through the emergency exit on that sinking plane.
He told the freaks and screams, and he suffered a little head injury.
The U.S. Marines say that fishermen working close to the repaired dams also help to use lifeboats to transport people to the ground before a plane sinks into the depths about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates 111 people have died of the world in an accident of registration-PNG for the last two decades but none of them have involved Air Niugini.
Analysis releases a woman's life-burning nightline
The charge of arresting things that took place on Saturday in the re-testing of a man accused of burning alive against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as a witness to intelligence analysts.
He made a big line to the jury about how he used cell phone records to collect various alleged movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from some cell phones that showed Tellis to be in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the previous alleged statement, announced by Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that the cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for a statement from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
The other inconsistency reported by Tellis was that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate they're familiar with each other in a week's time.
Rowlett reported that after the death of Chambers, sometimes Tellis deleted messages, calls and contact Chambers information from his phone.
"He removed the victims from his life," Hale said.
It is scheduled to begin the closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be brought to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of three hip hops want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who comes from Bristol, claims hip hop movement away from the origins of political messages and tackles social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have seen a recent resurrection in the UK through some artists like Akalas and Lowkey.
Another black man?
NY assistant demanded a couple because of the attack after issuing a "racialist" message
A New Yorker demanded a couple because he had been discriminated against after receiving a non-direct message from a complain mother and stating that he was "other black people."
The couple refused if they were considered rational, and considered it more like "affront."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, showed her concern when she realized that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black after she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"Don't worry about it before it's another day," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she even sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, "unfortunately" Plasco-Faxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that they were leaving the foster home, which is an African-American blender, because he had done a bad job and he was more expecting the Philippines, based on New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day’s work and then used Uber.
Now, Maurice demands that the couple provide compensation for the disbursement, and asks for compensation of about $350 a day for a period of six months, as a substitute for the nursing work that she had to work at first, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do anything like that," he said to the post on Sunday, and he added, "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple objected to the claim that they said they were rational, that the workers fired Maurice was a reasonable thing to do, that they were afraid they could not believe it after being offended,
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not a racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been rude to, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
It's like being wrapped up in a "trouble," said Plasco's wife for two months gave birth to her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment bank added.
In the course of the legal case, the public opinion processing has made a rapid raid on the couple in the social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington publisher is worried that the reader will not be involved with the bear talking, the new newspaper caught up.
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born not long after her book was accepted, explained in a letter: "It's hard to just talk without knowing the position in her mind, read it the first time she was published.
It's so funny to know how we know about the great success of Paddington."
Said his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspired by the writing of children's books with bear toys, who was very optimistic about the results of his work that had been rejected, he added the 60th anniversary of the publication that was "sweet" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proudly with the end of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet man, and he's not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington means so much to him, it's like you have a son who's got something: you're proud of them, though not all your efforts.
I think he looks at Paddington's success like that.
Although it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter is in a state of death and I have to say goodbye to her through the phone.
At the time of his arrival, his daughter was quickly taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to save him.
"No one makes a peaceful call to say it is very bad. That he is very likely not to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said he'd die in a couple of minutes ahead and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did it too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors have been given to keep her heart on slowly breaking out and leaving her body.
He died a few times during the handling process and everything felt dead.
I could just sit there and wait, understand all this has been caught.
I can't cry or cry or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarding the plane with other passengers - without realizing what she's been through.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head is turned upside down and my eyes are still fixed all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but when I was on the flight, I felt such a deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
Women who are mourning post cards to prevent themselves from killing on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones tried to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be contacted to get support.
The boy Mrs. Davis, Tyler, age 13 when he began to suffer depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a cheerful smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that his smile reveals the atmosphere."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm still worried if there will be a dramatic effect later."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone out there that you can close and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and be quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband for 15 years, not long after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He was at the lowest point when Christmas--when the kids opened their gifts he didn't look at them or anything."
He said, "It is a great trauma to them, but they must pass it.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was uncertain when the FBI started its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking -- an investigation that's limited in time, limited in scope -- we might be able to bring some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the "destruction" committee in the middle of the division of the board.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their strength is all due to time.
The five-week legislative election, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republic did so badly, they would become very weak in their ability to make the people whom they wanted to choose to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators, beat them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him to meet his wife Ashley, the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will sit.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the president's representative, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea 'anjlok' numbers below Kim
The number of people from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un ruled seven years ago, under the influence of a member of the United Korea parliament.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to data from the human rights data of Southern integration, said there were 1,127 rounds last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the border controls between North Korea and Tignkok and the higher tariffs supported by people's landings are the key factor.
Pyongyang didn't give a public comment.
Most Northers were finally offered to the South Korean population.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the refugees across Tigkok, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier across from the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
As a result, the fugitives treated them as illegal migrants from refugees and often forced them to return.
The relationship between the North and the South — which is technically still in the war — has greatly increased in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the two leaders of the country met in Pyongyang for a conversation that focused on the negotiated denuclearization.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean trip.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for less development since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, we will not be able to drop our weapons on the one hand," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "histories," he said he did not fit to serve at the Supreme Court
The chief opposition party Nancy Pelosi accused the candidate of the Brett Kavanaugh High Court of "histories" and said he did not fit in the temperament to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made that comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a film woman like that, they'll say "histories," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness in front of the judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally complains that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both of them were still a teenager.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, a few times almost screaming and having trouble speaking when discussing his family and his years in high school.
He also accidentally condemned the Democrats in the committee, saying the charge against him was "unreasonable and coordinated murder" organised by the liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's witness proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was usually against the Democrats.
"I think he discredited himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and Democracy," he said.
Pelosios objected if he was going to try to claim his approval, and if the Democrats got more voices in the People's Court of Justice.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't really tell Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court of his place is now," said Pelosios.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. High Court.
Pelicio added that as a Democrat he was concerned about the decision-making potential of Kavanaugh for the Health Services Act or Roe V. Wade, because he was regarded as a conservative sense of justice.
In the committee of inquiry, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would distort certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who's hysterical and routine to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?'
And the woman needs to handle it.
It's an ethical crack, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry: Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"For me it's not weird, what do you think?"
He continued, "I am greatly helped by a woman who is executive at a place where she says she's crying when she's angry, but develops a technique that means she's angry and starts to cry, and she's going to say to those who are talking to her, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The water was poured out as a way out of some anger because it was basically misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, at a time when I cried with unexpressed anger, was my stomach burned by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a little afraid - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Colorado Congress, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested in an out-of-marry affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, was very frustrated, he realized that there was no reason for himself not to resign as president.
"That's not a mature decision," she said to me as she laughed 30 years later.
"After there are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow Princess and Seven Curcaci."
Because he's late in the campaign, he's left behind in a fundraiser, and so he swears he won't follow the election unless he's able to collect $2 million.
It was a battle that ended in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters gave the man $1,000 just gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he was not going to launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotions -- thank you to the people who supported him, frustration with a system that made spending money so difficult and to draw the electorate from the delegation, and anger towards sexism -- making him difficult to talk about.
"You may think that I'm too nervous," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to it.
"You'll think that Kleinex is my sponsorship.

How the US-Pig-Pigkin's competition might be good for Beijing
The opening of a trade competition between the US and Tigkok is so distraught, and when the fight is still far from trying words, the gap between the two countries may only benefit Beijing long-termly, according to the experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, shot the first warning this early year by taxing Tionkok's key export goods including solar panel, steel and aluminium.
This week's very significant compliance started with a new tariff that affected the value of $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all the goods entering the United States through Tigkok.
Beijing has paid back every time, recently charged to five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
Bitch has requested to match the United States alone, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in the near future.
Asking Washington to step back means following his wishes, but publicly defeating the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President Tiongkok.
Still, the experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, US competitions can support Tingkok in a positive way in the long term by reducing inter-economic interdependence.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause economic movement in both countries is even more dangerous than what was previously noted," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, a team of experts.
Syria 'prepared' for the delay of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said that they were ready for the time of volunteering and offered to help rebuild a country that had been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country are improving.
"Today's situation in the field is more stable and secure, the blessings of progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the area that the terrorists are destroyed to return it back.
All conditions are now present because refugees return voluntarily to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and economic decisions that make their lives day by day and by day as targets.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian citizens have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still live in that country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a ruined country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any help or conditional assistance from the rebel countries.
Europe ensures Piala Ryder's victory in Paris
The European team has won Piala Ryder to win the US team with a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has never won Piala Ryder in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its rank when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who worked almost throughout the tournament, hit his teasing into the water at a couple of three holes to the 16th, admitted his defeat of Francesco Molinari.
Italia Molinari's golf course has been shining throughout its rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players who have ever won 5-0-0 since the format of the tournament began in 1979.
American athletes Jordan Spieth won 5&4 by the lowest ranking player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, wins 2 and 1 on Ian Poulter from England who may have played in his last Ryder Piala.
A veteran of eight Piala Ryder, Sergio Garcia of Spain, became a European with a total victory of 25.5 career points at this tournament.
"I don't usually cry but I can't hold it today.
This is a difficult year.
Thank you very much to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so glad, so happy to get the ball back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He gave his responsibility to his partner, John Ram, who won the legendary US Tiger Woods 2+1 golfer in a single game on Sunday.
"Wonderful pride that I think, defeating Tiger Woods, I grew to see him," 23-year-old Rahm says.
Woods lost in his fourth match in France and now has a record 13-21-3 career record Piala Ryder.
Strange statistics by one of the best players all the time, have won 14 main titles only under Jack Nicklaus.
US team fought all weekend to get fairway with Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the filmers disappointed his team, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
There's a time this morning when we're bothering Europe.
We're fighting.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players play very well.
We'll redesign, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Piala Committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to give the honor.
We're invincible."
