Green: Mariúpolis - the heart of war, stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymir Zelenski believes that the battles to the east of Ukraine and, in particular, Mariúpolis, define the course of war -- and if the U.S.A. is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy the occupied territories.
It's like, "Mariupoli is this, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It's fighting. We're fighting. We're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have a weaker position.
They (the city’s defenders) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be on the east side of the state, in the (area) OAS, and if they're stronger, the conversation table will be closer to us and we'll have the advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not be waiting for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now deoccupied.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in the talks will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we do.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory...."
Details: Greenski also said to go to the talks after the Ukrainians have been harassed, but "we should not lose the ability to make a diplomatic decision if they're with us."
It's true: "People will accept peace at any rate, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any peace on any condition.
But if we don't talk emotionally, the war should end in peace, or it'll end in millions of victims.
And even where millions of victims come to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight — but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."

I believe that she has experienced each situation for herself so that she does not repeat the mistakes she has made.
The directives are in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.

Many people in Ukraine are celebrating the same week.
This depends on faith.

Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of animal abuse from the civilian population north of Kiev.
The photographs of people being shot and shot have confused the entire civilized world.
Tens of people question each other, how could that happen in the 21st century?
And I'm not surprised at anything, it's exactly what I've been feeling sad about, and I've been waiting for...
I took out children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls and colleagues with the children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has been assisting the U.S.U.S.A. and no doubt that in the case of occupation, the priority of Kiev will not be to save my family.
Because I was and I'm absolutely sure that the existence of a rotten communist-KDBist regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it just can't exist, it's built on terror.
In 1937 one of my ancestors was shot in the prison of Zitomir.
A few years ago, a copy of the Grindling Case was given to the GST: The whole case is over a hundred pages, and the sentence on death is much simpler and even more frightening.
The defendant was illiterate, he denied the guilt.
The ethnic pole, the Catholic, had five children, was of the free people, the poor "one-door" path, never walked in the cracks.
The fact that they lived on the hill and had several cows was enough to raise a smoker and a year - old child to die.
The parents did not even know where the funeral was.
Grandma said that she had taken about a hundred people out of the village and killed all but two who had agreed to give a false witness.
In the criminal case, there's the name of the slammer Sharius.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a nearby village.

The brutal three - story peasants were ethnic Russians.
In an analysis of the case of prejudice, he was interested in various information sources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in the Russians, like the "Immortal Barack," which remind us of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, the descendants of NCSDs have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves were victims of Stalin’s repression and publicly wrote the names of the killers — the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like the computer found files with child pornography, they put her in jail, and she's dead fast.
The CDB is now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why, then, do you suddenly wonder at their actions now?
It focuses on the most endearing of human nature.
Over a thousand-year-old order tradition, slavery and imperialism were imposed in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then, over what happened, they did an animal genetic experiment, cutting the intelligence over a few minutes of red terror.
Look at the semi-French movie "Czechist" in 1992, that's all.

In the shortest term, the Bundeswer will give Kiev 100 of its shells, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new hoods can be placed 30 months after the contract was signed, the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is this the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?

I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm going to act like we're together.
I'd say after the war there's a lot of work to do.
So I'm not afraid I can't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what it's like to be with the house.

Oleg's disease is itching and coughing.
I'm just gonna be a little bit later, about 8:00, okay?
I don't want to argue with you.
Because I'm worried that it's okay!
Because with these excursions we didn't even talk about it!
I understand how important it is to you!
And I'm silent about myself (for me it's just the top I can't reach!)
How do you feel today?
Hey, sorry, I just woke up, I slept bad.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that Cole and I had begun to translate the test yesterday.
I will ask whether Gregory Denisenka or Yonascheka can) to help me with a little bit of math.
Maybe I can be useful to them, too?
If that's the case, I'd like to draw mathematical terms for the output.
We have geometry in common, but we have to work with Cole so that there's no error.
Thank you for testing.
We're looking forward to it too.
And so she's very happy with any gift
I wanted to connect to my Czech number
Yesterday at the stop of 402 buses, I met Ukraine, Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have arranged to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine where my heart was touched.
Philia in Hall No29 is specially designed for supplying and processing applications for assistance
Turns out I ordered a backup card.
No, I'm just a man.
So she wouldn't be afraid of anyone coming.
I didn't go, I did, I did, I did, I can do it, the main thing that you taught me how to turn the ghost on.
So you've been out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Memorial Center of the Babin Yar in Kiev, we honored 80 years of mass shooting by the German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We have to protect this base -- it's also part of our responsibility to our history."
If "evil demons of the past appear in new clothes today," he said, "for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must go on."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of peacekeepers, starved its inhabitants and allowed them to die of disease.
Russian armies carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually reminding them of the shootings in Granny Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans see this in real-time news.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, and weapons that have not been so long before.
Germany withdraws the supply of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak against the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means of mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way to conquer evil without risk and victims and stop the atrocities that take place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, make a trip, and write when we meet

Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were opposed to NATO entry and only 18% of respondents were "for".
After the Edenite Revolution, the escapes of Victor Yanukovic, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the beginning of the full - time war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record of Ukraine's support for NATO membership among Ukrainian citizens, more than 75%.
Despite Ukraine's accession to NATO and NATO's assistance under war, there are now many criticisms on the Alliance's and the member states' behalf of the lack of timely arms, refusing to close the sky, refusing to "fight" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to refuse membership in the Alliance by the position of the FP if it can stop the war and Ukraine will receive reliable security assurances, including the military.
In the new episode of the "Sweet Questions" podcast, along with the editor "European Truth", we talk about how Ukraine's Alliance has helped since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticised in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is as close as ever in history and why the security assurances discussed in talks with Russia can become another Budapest Memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
I've got a partner that says that my statement is on the lookout.
I gave it to her because of this mobile plug-in.
There's no visas, we need to go to the convention center and find out how to do this, because it was formulated in Poland, there was no visas, and there was a horse.
We'll have to write to you!
Dennis went in a good mood today.
He agreed to meet a young man from Ukraine he met at school yesterday to show him everything.
So I hope he's all right.
Because then I don't like it, it's not long enough.
In Ukraine it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tankers and pedestrians to Ukraine
I'm going to leave my children alone there for 3-4 years and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
And brothers with them at 6-7 in the morning
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a real feeling about this man, but he did not do so well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I rejected him.
Then, after a while, he telephoned what had been done in his heart.
He asked me to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of conversations.
At that time, I had problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he offered to marry me, and he died two days later.
So God himself decided our fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only talks in Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a home, and I am very happy to have where I live now and where I have to be with my baby.
Did I need to be mentioned earlier?
) Because I helped watch the children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write what you didn't understand.
I understand myself that the translator does not always translate the text correctly

That time in the winter I bought two ducks and my mom bought two
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You raised my mind.
Okay, let's talk about something else, and I'm not sleeping, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming about a bomb...
God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand the price of unqualified work, and I understand that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I can't have here and the money I made at home, I won't get here right now.
But just sit down and do nothing I can't do, because then every bad thought in my head is going to get you to do something physical.
At the airport, the papers are drawn from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m., and at other times you can just wait.
Volodymir came back at 4:00 a.m.
That's why we took them to us.
We went to the kitchen with Vic, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When he comes to you, write it down and you'll find out what's next...
And then I can't find a place anymore.
Sir, please, these are Ukrainian children's invitations that will enter the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I'm making it difficult.
Okay, write me when it's convenient.
I don't know.
That's what we planned.
I'm sorry, I really don't have missed calls in the middle.
The proposed work, the cleaning of the bathroom and the toilet, the 3 windows, the cleaning of the dust.
It's about 3-4 hours, 800 times once, from 19.04 on Tuesday, from 14.00 on.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're all right.
Can I call you?
Or could you write your wife’s contact?
I'm sorry I started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy in the pharmacy.

Thank you very much, you're doing a lot for our family!
Help is needed to be in the pool
But that's my idea.
She's from home, my uncle's handcuffed the roles and the board for a walk, she's going home, so that's what she's doing.
I got up at 9 o'clock, and I'm just getting my breakfast ready.
I'm very ashamed that you're communicating with me on your way out, and I hope I'm not very boring.
We want to notify you of the change in location and together provide documents for the continuation of the map
We're giving medical oxygen to all the hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you there's going to be a trial tomorrow.
One mother said it's hot for the kids to have a hot kiss.
He's coming to you in the guest room.
Please tell me, and do you have an approximate schedule of cleaning the apartment for a month ahead, though for an approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember this schedule at all.
The Russian army threatens to strike rocket strikes in Kiev: they say, "They didn't do that before."
Directly, Konashenkov says, "Let's see the attempts of diversions and strike by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the RF.
If such cases persist, the armed forces of the RF will strike the decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously been held."
Russians have been hit by rockets in Kiev since the first days of a full-scale invasion of the RF occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the 25th end of the Russian rockets that crashed the Ukrainian PHO system fell into a multi-quarter building on the city’s Poznak.
On February 26, Russia’s missile was involved in a multifaceted flood at Valeria Lobanovski.
On March 1, the Russians on the Roads near the Granny Yar, resulting in the deaths of five passersby.
On March 2, Ukraine’s WFP systems crashed over the South Railway Station, Russia’s rockets flying toward the Ministry of Defence’s building.
March 14 Breaks of Missile Missiles Destroyed the House and Trolleybus in the Curenevacs in Kiev
On March 18, the Russian missile entered the vineyard mass, which caused one man to die, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, the Russian fire rockets destroyed the modern Retroville TRC in Vinogradari, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
The mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klicko, told us on April 13, that the residents of the capital were evacuated from the city until they returned early.
The military explained to the local authorities that Russians can still strike rockets in Kiev, as well as many mines and unbreakable ammunition in the capital areas.
The chief executive of the Ministry of Defence's investigation warned on 12 April that the Russians planned the first series of attacks on the territory of the RF in order to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, a wave of oil blasted near Belgrade in Russia as a result of an air raid by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authority of Belgrade claimed that the Ukrainian missile had fallen near the city.
The elite in Washington, D.C., and Berlin are obviously throwing themselves into the cold pit of the idea that the Nazis will destroy Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But the Greens do not speak to them as much as to their voters and societies as they do in general.
By his talks in parliament and in front of thousands of crowds in the areas of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader does something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Greenish does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces European nations that choose those politicians.
And these talks, this exquisite flow of strength, emotion, and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Bayden categorically opposes the closure of the sky, 70% of its fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is opposed to the speeding up of Ukraine’s accession, the process is already in progress.
I understand you, so I don't want to be seen as a joke.
The costs you will collect are better given to people who need more.
I can come to you and we'll decide where to go.
But the air is clean, that's plus.
There it says that I have a tariff on two without the Internet, and I asked you to do the Internet.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have any accommodations today, or, as always, just the stairs down?
So I'm on my way and you're on your way.
But I'm not gonna stop loving you, you're all for me.
This loan is made by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days.
Katya asked for the Internet, could you give her a password?
I thought you and Milan didn't shoot a friend.
That's great. My husband's gonna drive me because he's got a car from the construction company where he works.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nika and our grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!

One of these parts can be used for 2-3 days, but every hour it turns out
I'm interested in architecture and color
I'm so glad you're all right.

I propose medical massages, a rehabilitation training room for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech.
Contact: ------- I'd like a letter to be able to write you through a translator, text messages here don't go, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call you, you don't have a deal.
You really don't want this pass?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a passport, I won't put it on.
Tell me how you want it, and I'll do it.
You didn't want to write me today... something.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask for anything.
More precisely, today I'm just asking for attention.
I want to say a lot today, so I'm asking you to have some more patience.
Are you all right with the idea?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, vacations.
You have a dream.
You're going to buy that dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't understand that.
He's snooping for the old reality.
You're calling at work, finding out whether to go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something clears up.
There's hope... it's not for long.
Now... they're making a deal... there's something going to be.
The brain refuses to accept...
I don't have anybody and nowhere.
I've got 50 bucks in my car, and everything we spent at home.
Many of us have been found by the leaders who have not paid a wage for our work.
Where do I go? Who do I need? How do I provide children? Where do I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't get anything out of the house... you're going 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know how to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you load the kids all over Prague.
I don't know, kids are asking for sweets, and you can't.
And we don't have one of these.
We have a choice to stay there and call the children at risk, or try to save ourselves here.
She was very happy with the heart and the things she was given when she came to school
I needed to make a phone call when you got here.
I'll write you dinner.
Yes, I believe in God alone and trust in him
I don't have the power to do this anymore.
I thought you fell in love with some Ukrainian girl and you don't have time to communicate.
I've picked up the menu, I've even ordered
2. Would you be interested in sharing with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?
If that's the case, the same type, I guess.
Please send a page with a visa or a stamp (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libushe, did you pay for that?
Because I can't understand.
You are doing us so much good....
We owe you a huge debt... thank you!
Yeah, I understand that's very good.
Now I'm gonna take a picture of the lady I'm teaching English.
Well, if you write tomorrow, we'll meet or not, maybe you'll change your plans...
Good morning. We've got enough teeth. It's so good to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
You're busy tomorrow, don't you want to meet after 4:00?
What a general impression you have from the first week
Karina brought the drugs to us last night, and we'll drink them.
I can work with sleeping sick and disabled children.
But I have to say that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have one.
I can wash you nice for lunch.
Because there's only gel antibacterial.
I'm not going to say that, because I'm not really going to be in town... about half a dozen.
What services/activities do you think are needed/are absent for older people?
I don't know because there wasn't a text from the bank and I didn't take the bank's cards, and the kids took out the bank app.
Then write to me, please, how you're going to go.
Today we have joy - our town of Bucha has been released from the occupations, our troops have stopped.
There's a cleanup from the enemy-- they're looking for Russians in the basements and in the apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, the radiation work will begin.
And John would look, maybe something should be repaired or something else done.
Diano, whatever you want, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Our boss wants to stay home, says he's tired of us and wants to be alone when we're going somewhere without him.
We're going to get the masculine and do the lessons.
These are small businesses that were operating in their premises and shops and that were broadcasting volunteer headquarters.
It's the tractors that actually travel under the guns in the field, because the time to sow.
These are the bus drivers who today agree to go in the vans to temporarily occupied territories to get help there and get people out of there.
These are heroic leaders who fearlessly drive in the fighting zone, calm down and help the fugitives in the cars, and at peaceful stations help the volunteers to load in the humanitarian car.
These were the drivers who were standing on the Vittomir trail in the first days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
These are the pipelines that export waste under fire, repair pipelines, and power lines to ensure that people are needed.
They are doctors and nurses who save people at 24 hours a day, not complaining about anything, but in a free moment they will still volunteer, collecting the pharmacy on the front.
We're in Ukraine, we're out of sugar when the little ones are leaves)
Please tell me, little children, what age do you mean?
My daughter, 8 years old, is that an acceptable age?
I'm looking for a room with my daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and hand over passports to train to Canada.
In Warsaw, there's a lot of people in the bus center and they don't work online.
I wanted to come one day, but it's far away, it takes a lot of time on the train, it's gonna be hard for the child.
So I decided to search for a place in Prague or near it.
No, we're all set up.
Yesterday's devices where to take them
But I can't change the password when I'm following the link, because I'm making the following mistake:
It's in a microwave, something's hot in there.
In Ukraine, the largest bank operators are always in contact with customers 24 hours a day, and all questions are resolved quickly:)
Well, I'll get used to the new realities.
I'm very unhappy, and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post. The most important thing is that there is the truth.
Yes, TV is full of this
We've already arranged for the refrigerators to respond to some Czech boys at 1 p.m. and help to move.
I want to go to you. I want to hug you so hard and kiss you.

I appreciate the projects tonight. After dinner
He's still asleep, he cried a lot at night, he's licking his teeth.
I'm now on the phone with everyone I know from Lviv, and a lot of people are dead.
The Czech Republic started issuing visas after March 22, according to me.
Before that time -- they put prints like that and then they compared these prints to the train.
The Ukrainian Foreign Electoral District (KWO Ukraine) is a electoral district that brings together the polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of polling stations in Ukraine's embassies and consulates and military bases abroad,[Vinoska 1] on which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DD Congo) are located.[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Ukrainian Electoral District is carried out by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the Foreign electoral district, only public elections are held: the election of the President and the people's MPs and the entire Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections are not conducted in the U.S.
They're at the train station near the mother's and the baby's room.
He says he doesn't understand where they're going.
You're mad at me?
Take a photo in a bathroom
I don't need money anymore. I borrowed a friend for a long time.
I wanted to say that I already connected the Czech cell number.
So I didn't need another device, I went to operator O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you, I'm very uncomfortable, and it's Sunday and I can't work anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have enough blankets, smoke blankets, tiles.
Good morning, I'll be on my way to 10 o'clock.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm going to break into myself with this.
That would be good, but I know there was no free space, and in principle they now have all the lessons on schedule and they teach pretty well.
Do you have a piece of meat to make a pie?
All right, let's go after Monday.
Did your mom tell you something hurt yesterday?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and she doesn't understand everything they're saying.
She went to school today too.
Today I saw Christine’s mother, but she didn’t even say hello.
A very delicious apple, what sort of apple is it?
The head of the President's Office, Andrew Ermak, reported that Russia is starting a "feikak operation" on the weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
It's a straight word: "They understand that they're losing the war, they see their distance, and they want to "get rid of" the arms supply by any means.
For example, one of the most recent faikas is the destruction of the Slovene ZRC C-300.
This information has already been clarified by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
We know Russian scenarios, I'll call one of them.
They can launch feikas, which Ukrainian soldiers bout themselves with weapons from the allies, and it takes a massive turn for the Russian army's arms.
I want to warn them right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of the U.S. soldiers are exclusively sending the enemy to the world.
I'm sorry, but I forgot to ask you how much bull to cost a garden in a month, and is he going to work in the summer?
Each one is given by force.
There are a lot more dubious stories, faith.
So that's what I needed to survive to change.
It is written in the Torah, and God created a wicked beginning in man so that it would change spiritually during the course of life
It's your home, you can invite anyone you want)
How do we find this lady in the sorceress tomorrow before we go to the hospital to visit the rat?
He listened to my mother and didn't come with us.
I know it wasn't easy for you.
And I'll do my best to make you happy.
After you wrote to me today, I'm happy.
I hope you're serious about it.
I'm looking at the announcement very busy. Now it's hard for us to do that.
I'm sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.
Didn't you make a phone call today because of a change in your mobile operator's tariff?
I'm sorry, but I can't expect anyone in this life.
Today, I was offered a job every day.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there already.
Thank you for having responded and I want to find you a good assistant.
Perhaps your father told you that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I don’t profess any religion.
However, she was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions that are based on love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and started reading the Torah.
I believe that there is no mediator between man and God.
You can still think about not putting a refrigerator next to the door in the boys' room.
Thank you so much for helping me.
We're looking for a dumpster for the usual cleaning of the apartment here in the village.
Proposal 150 kroner per year. Another collaboration with them.
I'm afraid I'm afraid of chemical care, but can I see a doctor?
I'm just worried about how we're gonna talk to you.
But we can just look at each other for a joke.
I went to my mother's, and there my sister and friend were going to go, and Anastasia asked them.
Where's your good wig?
Good day Victor approved this house just doesn't know how to help this gentleman with the papers to get a payout from the garage and said that with the furniture bank until there's no furniture available.
And thank you very much for the hospitality in your seat.
We've got good doctors here, too.
We've been cooking at home, and we can't find the keys from the mountains.
I'll take my underwear to the fifth party, and the pillow and clothes are extra in the apartment?
Yeah, but as we get in touch with the owners, there's no contact, I need a long-term home we work and we can pay, help if you can.
At the end of each description you have contact with the owner.
For communication, you can use this online translator from Ukraine to Ukraine and vice versa.
Anyway, I have four in one bed right now in a room where it's not even possible to get around, thank you very much.
Well, did you click on those links that I sent you above?
On each of these, you have a free offer of a home, a description, a contact with the owner and a photo.
I can't find a contact just an e-mail. Unfortunately, I don't have anything to do with a place closer to the Czech krumlov we have a job in Czech krumlov and we're now living in Prague.
Then I'm not going to help you.
Thanks for helping, we found a place, but we need a bed and a sofa, maybe you can tell us where we can buy a cheap budget because we have a weak budget, thank you very much.
Can you say he eats bad and often hurts his stomach too?
I saw your publication on the Music Project.
I'm the Hormeister of the National Educational University of Dragomanov.
I'll be happy to cooperate.
In the meantime, Russia displayed its missile complexes on the border with Finland.

We picked up the whole room and moved into the second room.
The international coexistence continues to express shock and indignation after evidence has been shown that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population of Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation. ”
"Reports of the killed, raped and severely wounded Russian troops of Ukrainian peacekeepers are worth the conviction," New Zealand Prime Minister Jasind Ardern told reporters in Wellington on 4 April.
"Russia must answer the world for what they have done," she added, saying that her government is discussing additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kissid called the incidents "a violation of international law".
After reports of hundreds of peacekeepers were reportedly shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Buti by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
Photographs depicting the bodies of civilians killed with their hands tied up have shocked many and called for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
The president of France Emmanuel Macron announced in a radio interview on 4 April that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
"What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Makron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanches said Russian troops could go so far as to make the "genocide" in Buchi.
"We will do everything we can so that those who have committed these war crimes will not remain innocent," Sanchez said in Madrid.
On public television later on April 3, Russia’s IPS River Maria Zaharov rejected the charge as “a provocation. ”
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "prohibited" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after these materials appeared does not raise any doubt as to who has "prescribed" this story," Zaharova said.
Formerly, Russia's Mino-Defends also claimed that the image of Buchi is "one more order of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian armies left the city until March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on 4 April to discuss what it called "a provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Buchi.
On 4 April, Russia's next committee issued a statement declaring "research" on the charge of Ukraine's spreading "intellectually false information" about the actions of the Russian forces in Buchi.
The president of Ukraine, Volodymir Zelenski, made a statement on April 3, accusing the Russian troops of committing genocide in the city, and told the leaders of the Kremlin that they had to come to Buchi to see what their troops had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," said Greenski in a video-referring, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting at the head," he said.
He stated that Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, and the Russian troops should bear responsibility for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people tied to their back and their heads, I don't understand," he said about the scene of the victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, about 35 kilometers north of Kiev.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian Service Radio Freedom on April 2 saw the streets of a small city of the body as civilian.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP journalists saw at least 21 people in different locations in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people -- everyone in the civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to locals, used Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that at least 410 peacekeepers were found in the Kyiv area, which was controlled by the Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They told them that Kiev was gone." As the crews drove the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasions in Ukraine are accompanied by horrendous acts of robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is another point in this list that is now much less information — the export of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
About mid-March, Russian crews "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements in their territory and in the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military police.
"Ukraine Truth" has been looking for exported Ukrainians and their families to inquire about how the "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
Heroes have come to a voluntary evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and indiscriminately.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain a relationship with their family.
However, in view of the Ukrainian authorities’ claim, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under strict pressure.
So in Melitopolis, the Russians stole the staff from the second post office, took the children out of there without their parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of a dead Ukrainian champion from the Soviet Union.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Hostomel in a few months to war.
Alexander himself got a job at Antonov Airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although it was civil.
As the real plastics, Dennis and Marina had gathered the alarming bags before, but in the morning of February 24th, they couldn't escape.
They had no car, and the primitive buses were no longer taking anyone.
About 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw the helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first missiles.
One of them was involved in a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17th, until the Russian troops took them to Belarus.
In their basement, about 40 people were buried.
Not all of them made up their minds.
"On the 6th of February, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian came to the podium.
They say, "Who is there?" I say, "Come out."
They searched for me, asked who in the basement if there was a weapon.
All the men were asked if they were serving in the army.
They said to the women, "We have come to protect you by order of Ramzan Kadirov."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even an army, young boys of 25-35 years old.
They said, "The Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sasko Billy (commanded by UNA-UNSO's Nationalist Movement Viking, who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen War, U.S.A.), now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked why we were not enough.
We say that the water was a big problem with her.
They broke the store, took the goods out of there and brought us six bottles.
There are still videos on the Internet where children thank Kadirov for his food.
So after they stole the shop, they brought the cowboy and they said, "We understand this is wrong, but we need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovich."
No one especially wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give up our phones" -- they laughed.
Still, they kept separate from the Russians.
They said how good they came, because they didn't want the war, and the Ukrainians supported and they said, "Putin is a bastard, Kadir, too, but we can't do anything, because there's our families."
And most of the time, they didn't fight, and they drove to rob the stores, and they were in a hurry.
The cockroaches got caught, one tied to one leg of a Georgian stick, and the other to his white stick, and they called it a "college."
They arrived in Ukraine without any preparation.
I don't know how their investigation worked... when they were shot at Buchi, so that they didn't even take the killed, they asked us, "What do you have, artillery?"
More than that, we were standing at the edge of a chain — waiting for each other not knowing each other, asking for passwords in the first days to find out who they were or who they were.
They were with us by March 13th, after which the Russian OMON came and followed them as an omansian desant.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses, ours always fell into it with the "Birractars."
But they came and told us that the U.S.U. is no longer there, but there are "Azov" and, according to them, "Azou" so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
"Cyev's been giving up" came from the beginning of March.
One day, a Russian or a dissident officer, or a FSB representative, approached us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- there was the noise, Hostomel, we thought maybe we had a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We're saying we don't want to go there or there.
To what did they say, "So grieve the mentality of your children!"
As it worked out, they threw us into the basement and started shooting us from under the house -- either the City, or the Minimets.
And then it flew back... the neighboring buildings just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our home had a direct impact on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us to Belarus only, promising to hand over to the underprivileged and the Red Cross.
The party didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the village, saying, "You're being shot there, the organs are being sold."
We were taken through Chernobyl, along both sides of the road were hot, a broken technique, although the Belarusians told us that Russians were driving straight to them.
There's a lot of cabons, buried equipment, and soldiers.
We've had an improvised check at the White House crossing point, and many people were completely undocumented because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given a cup of tea.
And this is where we hear the shots, and it shoots the rocket, and it looks like it was working on "Iscander" in Kiev.
Although those of the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, they turn on the cordon."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand that.
We were then taken to the bus and taken to the Chunky Sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager came, Wenger Vasil Stepaniovic, saying, "Here I am, here I am, from Montenegro.
But I understand Putin and Lucashenk won't stop until they get these holes.
The poor people are suffering.
And we have Lukashenko so good!
He will say, and so will he."
They offered to give an interview with Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations representations (at least they were called) were spreading disinformation that men in Poland could not go.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though there was a problem with the documents — the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get him on Monday, and war broke out on Thursday.
There was nothing we could do at the Ukrainian consulate, but in Minsk, they said that no one would take the bus without the passports.
I'm going to say that we had a lot of help from Belarusian volunteers.
We were both settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
Our second group migration representative said that you can spend a maximum of five weeks here, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled by Mozira (about 30 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border, U.S.A.), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first goes off, it shines beautifully, and then it goes off.
People sitting on a bus in Mozira told us that the Russians were always shooting from the polygons.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break a son if they called him.
But the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk does not believe at all.
They will say, "You have denied us, we are a people of peace."
They do not understand that their poles are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us to be taken to Estonia.
Now we're going through the registration, we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia's Ukrainian flag now, as much as Estonian."
Marina lived in a military town in Hostomelia with her brother’s family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
In the morning of February 24th, she called the nobles and asked them to collect the most necessary items and documents.
At night they went to the basement of a neighbor’s house.
Marina herself could not return home, and in principle she could not, no more.
No one knew anything about evacuation.
And on Monday, you can't go somewhere in the center?
Thank you, we have everything. And we're always waiting for you in the guest room!

And in this little apartment, there's no Wyafay hunting, mostly all of your questions, I don't know what to do now, and there's no online work for kids on Monday, and there's no Internet.

Can we agree on how best to do that?
On April 1, Buchi City’s head, Anatolio Fedoruk, announced a joyful message — on March 31, Ukraine’s military released the city from Russian predators.
The following day, the crews were expelled from all over Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should have felt at this point in their lives was overshadowed by fear and hatred, for at the same time it became known that only one Russian bullish was shot at at at least 280 peacekeepers.
They were just killed on the street, some tied their hands and shot in the head, some of the killed, the underage.
Killed and followed by torture, the old village of Motijin Olgo Suhenko, her husband, Igoria, and Alexander’s son, were found stolen on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the brotherly tomb, and Igoria was in the sewerage.
Both of these were found within 20 miles of Kiev.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go home, nobody's gonna be home.
I ordered a mail from Germany with DHL.

I've been talking to you very often, and I think you're hearing my thoughts.
President Volodymir Zelenski stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners were too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some kind of equipment it's done late.
So what if, for example, we talk about Mariúpolis when you're losing thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's really right.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Greensky.
On the question of this, enough weapons were given to Ukraine to make a difference in war, the president said, "No, no."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not be, or it would look different.
"She would have opened up otherwise, we'd have the arms of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be wars, though," he added.
Remember, Britain's Prime Minister promised Ukraine a new military aid, which includes weapons and anti-fraud weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I come home.

He was a very rich man, but I liked him because I had my point of view of life I met him, then I left him.
He was a very rich man, he telephoned for a while and told him that he had had surgery on his heart.
He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought I might be his toy and I might need his money.
And then he made me a proposal.
"I had a car in my yard, on a crocodile like that, and I was throwing my chests.
And they kept me in the house, then took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people, about 400 people, breathing was nothing.
What about the house that you took the picture?
I haven't really gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already defended this phenomenon.

I'm not thirsty for everything.
I understand that I can't sit with you. I need to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and we don't need any Ukrainian television.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pre-presidential, propaganda channel, not interested in me at all.
What happened there at the stop with the man that the police came and quickly came?

"I'm telling her that the TV and the receiver's refurbishment has been delayed by importing details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to interrupt when they call."
"We've been hiding for a whole month from the world's war info.
As long as it works.
In Plamka, however, on the pus, and on the back of the puzzling leaves, this may be from stress, changes in diet, and vitamin deficiency.
The last two reasons have been removed, and this is no reason for stress, unfortunately.

Thanks to Olga's bad hearing and most of her time in her room, her bride month lived in the apartment with her "incognito."
And on April 1, 93, Oxana Polov, for the first time in her life, took up arms.
"33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in the apartment.
She was also hiding from the war, and what I was about was as formal as ever for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver, she listened for 4 hours, then she sang for 2 hours."
The receiver was always at bedside.
Most of the time the world spends in its own room.
It's a bad thing to hear, it allowed me to be undetectable to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I hid in my room.
First, she hid the receiver and the TV.
And then she called everyone who was communicating with her, and that's 6-7 people.
She asked her to talk to her about anything but war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end
That's April 17, I'm cleaning 2 apartments :)

A British man in the U.S.U. who defended Mariupoli says he's willing to surrender to the Russians
A British military officer from the Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who took part in the defense of Mariupola, told his friends and family that they were carrying weapons and would be taken to the Russian occupations.
Source: Aiden Aislin's Twitter site, British who served in the U.S.U.L.S.L. since 2018, the U.S.A. with reference to family members and friends Aislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend Aislin, who spoke to him
We got a message from him, saying, "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariúpolis, but we have no choice but to take the lead in the Russian army.
We had no food and no ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will be over soon."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate U.S. Marine Corps, which is involved in Mariupoli's defence operation.
Journalists of the U.S.U. were in contact with the mother of military servant Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had reported on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Aislin had told about the plans of their capitalization branch.
According to him, the brigade ended up fighting and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said Aislin's sub-section was going to surrender to the Russian sub-sections so that they wouldn't get a gun and a bullet in the hands of the so-called "cadronists."
Also in the sorceress, the audio recording of a telephone conversation seemed to speak to a well - known American friend who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation with Aislin, they said they were trying to get out of the city in civilian clothing, but they failed.
The British had previously told him that Instagram was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in a fight against terrorists called the Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the U.S.A. and made a vow.
Aisla's friends and close friends were called Johnny, and he's more famous in the sorceress than Cossack Gundi.

When You Can Bring Things
You're very interested in tradition, we're going to Christmas this way.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved Bill 7176, which has the title "The need to monitor the potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economy."
It's amazing that in fact the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economy was... the place where members of the Supervisory Board are meeting.
Initiators of the bill believe that the decision making by the supervisory board of the Qiji conditional company may at one time solve the problems of Ukraine’s national security.
We know a lot of new dangers for companies, but we do not know of any company that has a physical need to hold a supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is understood to be a great basis for "to know" all the acquisitions in the difficult reform of entrepreneurship after the Revolution of Christmas, including independent supervisory councils, and then to establish manual management.
That was before 2015.
Why should the management board and those involved be interested in the company?
What is more, if under the patriotic slogans one harmful bill "flights", others can fly tomorrow -- for example, the state procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NGOs.
Many things can be written for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of war and Bill 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was added to the comparative table of Bill 5397.
In general, the desire to leave the supervisory board in some way has been circulating among some peoples for a long time.
Instead of being critical, and in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for it to be adopted.
And then we'll put our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing post-war companies.
The Prime Minister of Economic Affairs Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation at the risk of losing the Internet and other means of communication that would prevent the remote work of supervisors.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board is unable to make the necessary decisions, as far as the company's work is concerned.
We agree that such a risk exists, but can he prevent the movement of members of the supervisory board to Ukraine?
Let us imagine a somewhat cynical situation in which independent members of the supervisory board (which make up the majority of the board) put their personal security above the company’s interests and refused to come to Ukraine.
In that case, they may be released according to the bill.
And then, faster than anything, it'll lead to the loss of a quorum needed by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, since the law provides for a competitive selection that takes on an average of 3-4 months.
Hence, the decision proposed by Bill 7176 could not, rather, save itself from losing the supervisory board’s ability to make decisions!
National MP, author of Dmitro Nataluha's bill, gives other arguments to support him.
In particular, he notes: "Many companies, such as the defence and industrial complex (PDO), now need relocations" and therefore "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom."
For the first time, in Ukraine, there are almost no OPCs that have supervisory advice.
The Supervisory Board is not in the Ucro-Defense, which essentially manages almost all of the OPC support companies.
But even in the "Ukraosur," according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties without a free basis.
The entire power of the Ucroboroma is a director-general who will take decisions on the need for the relocation of an OPC company that is part of a concert.
Moreover, such an argument does not hold criticism even because Bill 7176 in general does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of OPCW companies.
Mr. Dmitro, on his Facebook page, also cites the arguments that can be referred to the "emotional" category.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of companies and banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "relevant foreign experts in the very first word "war" leave Ukraine in 2021, but in 2021, they remain members of the supervisory councils in state companies in Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand barrels, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First of all, this manipulation – most of these members of the Supervisory Councils have never lived in Ukraine and have only arrived here periodically.
So to say they're leaving Ukraine, gently saying it's unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian supervisory councils have long been able to hold online meetings.
It is a tool that has been widely used in the world’s practice, and in a wide variety of areas: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
It should also not be forgotten that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a general rule, such people have other jobs, and that's exactly how electronic communication helps them.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not make identical claims to members of the Ukrainian Supervisory Board?
Because they too are not at the place where their companies are located.
In short, this is not the first populist attempt to remove foreigners from supervisory councils, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.

We usually need a passport from one of the adults
In the areas of the Kyiv region, which have been released from the occupations, Brovorska, Višgorodsk, and Buchansk, they conduct a two-year enhanced commandant hour.
Paulluk directs: "In the populated areas of the Brvatska, Višgorod and Buchanan regions under Russian occupation and released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the commandant hour has been increased!
In the territory of these cities and forces there will be restrictions from 21:00 on 2 April to 06:00 on 5 April."
Details: According to the head of the bulwark, it is now categorically forbidden to stay on the streets of populated areas and other public places, to move by transport and pedestrians.
People can only go out on the street when they are alarmed to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression — to clean up and spread the territory.
Omeljanuk called on people who had left these areas to stay away from returning home.
At the end of Kiev, the command clock will last from 21:00 to 6:00 a.m. every day.

In the IMF, Belarus reported that on the night of March 30th, three Bobruisska residents were detained, one wounded, for the active support of the SBR specials.
According to the Springs, men in detention were actively opposed and tried to escape.
Security forces were using weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical attention.
Chief of the IMF Criminal Police, Belarus, Gennadius Kazakevic, stated that "acts of terrorism at the RB railway will be severely stopped" by armed forces.
On April 6th, it became known that on March 30, the police had another co-worker at the Belarusian railway station, a co-worker at the Baranovich Department of the BZD and the administrator of the BZD thematic resources at the Vkontaktie and the Unclassues Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now living, and where he is unknown, he reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railways were detained in Belarus for the fun.
We remember: The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lucashenk extremist regime, continues to call for the diversions of the railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus as part of the Peramoga plan.

US prohibit investment in RF and impose sanctions against Putin's daughter
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, impose new sanctions on the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
That is what the White House has to say.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution, which is owned by the government, and Alpha-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will fully prohibit new investments in the FP.
To this end, US President Joe Byden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on an approved decision of more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large-scale traders, financial institutions, and other providers of services, such as legal and consulting firms," the White House stated.
The third step in the United States’s new sanctions was the restriction on large Russian state enterprises in the critical area.
This will prevent US citizens from operating with these organizations and will freeze any assets they have in the jurisdiction of the States.
Minfin's detailed list will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's children, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvey and Prime Minister Michael Mistytin.
Penalties are depriving them of the U.S. financial system and freezing all the assets they have in the United States.

I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czechia.
So we have hope that someone will be there for the first time) We can even pay the room or the apartment, but if that's what's going to be on our pockets.
We guarantee purity and order.
We don't have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time.
After lunch, I had one lesson in English, and after that, I went to work in the children’s room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill all the papers.
I hope she understands everything and works well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She made a announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call school, Kira doesn't take the phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she came to school.
They isolate the Russian office: they stop the investment and stop supplying.
However, we did not understand.
There were no military shelters in our home.
Our house is near the military and the oil base.
He just helped me because I couldn't do it myself.
I prepare well, do not ask for more, and give good advice
I'll give my advice.
It's kind of hard for me, but I understand I have to go through this stage.
I'll see you on Thursday, and I'll tell you everything.
It's all right.
I play how often you clean up
I clean every week.
I'm sorry, I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Dreamed of Being a Teacher
My girls can't go anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear about the house information, I'll let you know.
I'd be happy to rent a house with an orderly girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
On my own, I'm not going to cheat.
Thank you very much.
I haven't written you another 54-year-old Natal. Please write the exact address and the price of the courses.
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my name, it was one of my births:)
Hello, Mr. Reirard, I'm sorry I didn't see you, I'll do it now and I'll send it to you right away.
We're going to the Medical Commission right now.
I mean, it's time for Ani to work the next day.
What day is it better to come early? ( Maybe on what day is it a little more work?)
I hear tomorrow, the Internet works bad.
You're lucky to do that.
Thank you... for finding something from things, but there was nothing from technology...
Both beginners, except abbots don't know anything
There's nothing going on.
Is it possible on Monday, 25.04?
Children can be taken with them, the toy here is enough :)
Guessed about Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'm making up something with this money.
We'll do it sometime.
But as this will be paid, please, no credit.
Write me right, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
You need to take the clothes they gave you?
It's not my day.
Something has come from you, I can't see what
I’m also very sad
I'll remind you of the invoice later.
Do you only have a father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do house cleaning, and how many houses have windows?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your affairs.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I'm going to read Joe Dispens, he's doing scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
The TV journalist "1+1" Natalia Nagorna released a video on 12 April morning, which was handed over to the 36th Marine Corps from Mariupoli.
It says that they had no weapons left to take part in the battles and the mountains of the wounded.
They said, "The bill goes for an hour."
Prior to that, on April 11, the 36th, a special sea pacho brigade that participates in the protection of Mariupoli, published a petition to Ukrainian in Russian.
The statement stated that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupoli, and the Ukrainian military command was not connected to the fighters for two weeks.
In so - called sorceress, it was said that the application was published in Russian.
The chief commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valeries Zalujny, assured us that the link to the Defence Forces in Mariupoli is, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of a public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal plant in Mariupoli and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian crew dropped Mariúpol’s poisonous substance of unknown origin.
According to leader Azza, Andrei Billecki, the RF army used a chemical weapon against the Azovstal plant, which keeps fighting the Azov forces.
Thank you, I'm going to settle down under you, that'd be very good.
The situation itself, as long as we're here.
2 hours of driving )) walking, mom on the shops and back!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
The Czech drone squadron from today began flying over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional copyists will be used to detect, and some of them will be used for the direct destruction of an enemy predator.
Two Zacarpathian and two Czech “bird ” brothers were sent to Ukraine yesterday afternoon thanks to the MP of the Mutakev Mistrim Labutenka.
Today, their intern friends at the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/exampleher101/Vasily Stour delivered the drones for destination: they were given special divisions of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
With the aim of maximizing the efficient and safe use of Copteres - their locations will be kept in the secret immediately.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: In the near future, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupation and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I love sweet, but I can't do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'll be right back to Ukraine, keep working.
If it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try myself, but if there's a problem, I'll write it to you if I can?
Main to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady in the village of Job, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no one.
Maybe she'll be happy, and she'll get her mood up.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
I've had medications and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but I'd rather meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, take off the music you like.
I'm curious about your musical abilities.
Mom and Dad Should Be Obedient
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's knee.
Today there was colder and rain, and tomorrow must be warm.
But there's no harm done to destroyed homes, to the harm done to the people being abused.
In Herson, the crew members were acquainted with the "Slav Ukraine" memorial in Herson on the street of Prescopsky.
Details: It is noted that the unknowns broke the flag of the European Union, took the pictures of the heavenly hundreds and the dead in the Russian-Ukraine war.
The bandits broke the portraits of the Heroes of the Heavens and the perishable participants of the Russian-Ukraine War.
We've got a flag.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the Christmas party, we don't have that custom, so we didn't know, give the kids only chocolate and cooking, maybe something else was needed to give.
In Czech, there's someone to talk to, if that's the case.
Because I'm living a guy in a group where twelve people are going to be here, and then they're going to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
He's already in trouble today.
Even today, he's been sleeping there.
That is why we are making great progress.
I'm going to have to bring the cowards together!
I don't have the strength to do them today.
Since I've been pushing away from the days and the time I've been doing cleaning after the guests, I can say about April for a month because I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
By May, I can say about the end of April or at the beginning of May.
She just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I haven't been writing dinner for a long time, and I'm a little sleepy.
If you don't mind, can I come today?)
or we'll meet you after your arrival)
He's a modest man, he's been learning a lot lately, and he realizes that he really needs it in his life.
Hey, everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today, we have a small lesson with a lady who is the head of the Economics Department of the Land of Highness.
She was very pleased with my work.
A sin in his lips was good for him.
On Monday, I have to make a confirmation of employment and a cash payment.
I'm sick of Friday.
I don't do anything but a lot of them and sleep (and drink a lot of water)
If he goes to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if I can.
I'm going to import another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
It's very bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad.
That's what it's all about.
Can you send me the right e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language you've written to.
And are the children feeding there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a minute you can go in there's one question.
If you still need help, write it down
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
At first, we didn't want you to collect the money so that people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have two points:
I'll be able to rest. Collect power and energy. Thank you for today's gift.
I'm going to see the video right now, that's good because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Karasin calls on employees and students to carefully verify any information, not to trust anonymous sources in texts and social networks, hearings and gossip.
Orient yourself with official information.
That's how you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
I picked up a few pieces of paper for the portfolio.
After the festival, the Internet is to be held.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I get the day I'm out of work is a pass.
Staff meeting: Russia prepares a provocation in the University to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may encounter provocations in Moldova's Prenistrian Region to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state."
It literally says, "It is not excluded by the Russian Federation's armed forces from provocative actions in the territory of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create a future group of armies for operations in the Sgodan direction.
In the next few days, the crew will likely try to reinstate the crew.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and deliver a special composition, weapons, and techniques for participation in fighting activities in the territory of Ukraine.
The training of weapons and military technology is being carried out at the 60th permanent deployment of the Special Motorbike Brigade (Monaster) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the marked weapon will be moved to a temporarily occupied territory of the Danube region.
Also, to restore the loss of the special composition of the battalion tactical group divisions from the 36th individual motorbike brigade (Borza, the Zabaykali province) of the 29th General Army of the Eastern Military District, a set of military personnel from the designated brigade is carried out.
The particular problem of the enemy is that the driver's station and the driver's mechanics are complete.
The event of the selected special set of permanent deployments is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
The opponent will probably continue to hit the transport infrastructure in the territory of Ukraine for the purpose of destroying them or getting them out of the way.
The designated divisions of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the task of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Bilorussian border in the Brest and Gomelian areas.
In the Slovene direction, separate divisions of the 6th Allied Army and the coastal forces of the North Fleet continue partial blocking of the city of Harkow, and continue the artillery shootings of certain areas of the city.
In the Islamic direction, an air search of the area continues to reveal the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
The opponent is using the Orlan-10 BPLA.
With the strength of two battalion tactical groups of enemies, he tried to make a move in the direction of the Doughenka and Dmitrovka, and he had no success and went to the previous positions.
On the Donetian side, the opponent continues to focus on the people under the control of the safe, the ruby, the Lower and the Novobachmutak and the establishment of full control over the city of Mariúpol.
The enemy tried to make a storm of action in the area of the Golden Age, and he was not successful.
In the city of Mariupoli, with artillery and aviation, the crew continues to operate in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By means of separate divisions, the enemy carried out artillery shots of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of the High Council, Trudolovek and Marjansk.
In the areas of Donetsk and Lugansk, Ukraine's defenders for the past century have seen four enemy attacks, five tanks destroyed, eight armed units, six vehicles and eight artillery systems.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
We're usually trying to get there, but I doubt it.
And you might want to sleep, and I'll delay you.
Are you sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see today, so tell me, I'll get it.
Thank you, we didn't watch TV at home, and then we didn't have to set up 1 + 1 :)
I'm going to turn on the TV here just to listen to the Czech language.
I have a monthly tariff package to finish today:)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for hanging, canvas, thread for hanging
I understand, I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us a lot of pies.
We'll meet my father later, necessarily.
I read the release in Facebook, and it seems like Google wrote something like that, I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we brought the things you brought, but there are things that little ones can bring to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the reason for the job.
If Mr. Director is in charge, I can start working from next week because tomorrow morning I plan to go to the office to report the documents (if I get them, because very large lines) and on Saturday rain:)
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I'm studying Czech to know perfectly, I'm dreaming to work on you.
Friends of old and not very, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends by spirit and mind.
Now you too have had a difficult time.
During the last month, I have been communicating with a lot of you.
Your life, which was never easy without it, turned from your feet to your head, as was the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you run away from Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame because of your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
Because they're giving Ukraine your name.
Some of you, activists, have long written a threat, and you have prepared for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
Let’s talk a little later — as usual, Sasha replied in a lacony.
Others — cultural actors, artists, critics, writers — are impressed by the sudden siege of your tiny world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be open: except for the very few of you -- those who worked in the memorials, in the new newspaper, in the echoes of Moscow, in the Medusas, in the organization of the Revival and in the bottom of other places -- would many of you do anything to oppose this regime?
Unless they're in the meetings when they're done.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "Silver to hide, keep quiet"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your persistent indifference to what is happening around you, by your appetite and by your passive participation, which are now likely to be a great burden to your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In 1990, there was a brief period when you had to some extent freedom and democracy -- a messy, even curved, but real.
But 1991 proved to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you're finally so terrified of being sad that you're looking for salvation behind the King's back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he didn't kill, you still think he was safer.
Yes, mistakes were made.
Instead of grabbing and publishing the CDB archives, as the Germans did, you took the soul to the Dzerjinski Memorial, and allowed the CDB to lay down, upgrade, transform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between national theft and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option — and you humbly responded to the robbery.
In 1998 your economy fell, and this meant the end of mass meetings for great social justice or against war in Chechnya.
A major concern was survival.
And then Putin showed up -- young, entrepreneurship, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
A few of you have bought it, but you have voted for it anyway, or you have preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare the Czech Republic with the earth again, most of you looked at it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping those affected by the road anti-terrorist operation, and seeing the ruins of the Great, Qatar-Yurti, Itum-Kali and other cities in my eyes.
Sometimes on the weekend I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of peaceful people, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Brother, we've had enough of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
The answer was, "Friends, it's not my Chechen, it's your Chechen.
It's your country, take the hell away from me.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your government that's bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came an economic rise in the middle of zeros, promised by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the money stolen will remain in the middle-class pockets.
Many of you have become well - made, some rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
The prices have grown, and isn't it?
Moscow would shine and shine from the nose.
When several opposers were killed — Juria Chakochihina, Anna Politkovsky, Alexander Litvinenka, and others — many of you were shocked and terrified about what had happened.
Still, the matter was not settled.
When Putin handed over President Medvey's post after two terms, and he took the prime minister's place himself, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When after a few months of Medwiede Russia's rule invading Georgia, most of you ignored it or kept quiet.
How many of you have I met in the years to come on the mountain slopes of Hudauri, in the mountains of Kazbegi or in the coffee and in the Turkish lasagna of Tbilisi while the part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that there's hardly much we've done in the West if we've done anything at all.
A bit of resentment, a little bit of sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia's more critical violation of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
But by the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin re-changed the seats with Medvey and planted the president's chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out on a massive protest.
The name of Naval has become clear, you haven't walked out of the street for half a year, and the regime has finally felt terrible that the ground is losing its feet.
Then he struck the answer.
Alternatives were first organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have been given huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often, and I still hear it.
"It's so strong, and we're so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look what they did two years ago.
Angry by the proselyte president, who fooled their European hopes, they once seized Maydan — and never left him.
They took the tent city by themselves and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves by means of a knife, a gun, and a Molotov cocktail.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protestors turned into attackers.
Many have died, but they have won.
Janukovic became a fugitive, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves, and expel them if they did their own wrong.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
This was a bad example.
So, using a general combination, he took Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but there was little benefit.
How many of you have been caught!
As far as I know, 91% of Russia's citizens supported the annexation.
From where a new myth was born, many of you who despised Putin and his jokes suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I find it hard to find a reason, since immediately thereafter we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained with my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid new in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, just like the new ones after the restoration that began in Moscow in 2012, with their binbegams, the common wifi and hipster coffee.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
IDI or something... even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria then criticised it in an interview because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I drove there and I saw myself on the streets of Homs state snipers shooting cold blood in my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers who started bombing thousands of peacekeepers in 2015, getting experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Nimeler:
"They first came for socialists, but I spoke, because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade union members, but I spoke because I was not a trade union member.
Then they came to the Jews, but I spoke, because I am not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left who could say anything to my protection."
How many of you have been talking about Czechs, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some actually speak now — such as Dmitro Gluhovski, Mikhailo Shiskin, Mikhailo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Oujanykov, risking getting into a new GULAG or setting up a Nawal company.
As for others, you are best aware of the country in which you live.
So, I'm sure you understand, when Putin gets married to the Ukrainians -- or if he doesn't have it, he'll marry you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are courageous, but mostly alone have gone out into protests and still have a little time, but soon they will get more serious.
For a thousand of you, who signed the petition, who expressed the disagreement in the sorceress (even a black square in Instagram) or spoke in private talks with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or 25 years of free will were given simply for anecdotes, they are not in the distant past — and now they are very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who's going to speak for you then?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – fears the travel regime: they prove that they can fight it.
And that wisdom, motivation, and courage can stop it, no matter how oppressive it may be on the paper of his advantage.
Considering everything, few in Russia realizes it as well as what war is going on.
But you, my friends, know what's going on right now.
You're reading the news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you're in touch with.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your election is just a gohma, your laws, if you don't take account of the repressive ones, they don't cost more than the paper on which they're written, your last free media is gone, your economy is destroyed faster than I write, you don't have credit cards to buy tickets abroad, even if there's any travels left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will require your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try or go somewhere, or you'll be disappointed.
I doubt you'll see another version.
And yet another one remains.
What's the last thing that's going to break this regime.
And you may need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not startle you: because of the economic collapse that strikes Russia, it is likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices fly away and wages are not paid, people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace would go out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people a lot more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to meetings on its own, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them individually.
Organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will need to be converted to mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool -- the internet that can limit the regime, but that's still working and that can be adjusted in almost any circumstances.
The organization of the Revival has been fragmented, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're a lot, you're millions.
The Moscow police can deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If there's more than 300 grand, it's going to be shocked.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight Putin when it comes to business?
After all that he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a sense of fear; those who have children will be afraid of them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid of you, too.
For example, in the case of Syria, and now in Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what is going on with those who tend to neglect their master, who tend not only to demand freedom but really try to get it.
But even if you don't do anything, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will end up playing in a computer game chat -- and he will be arrested; your daughter will express her anger on the Internet -- and he will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes -- and he will die in a serial camera under police depth.
This is what has been happening for many years — and it will only continue to be strengthened by growing and expanding.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know what's going to end.
Do cold blood, think strategically, and reach out for that to happen.
We were at work on Friday, and we were told that we could come Monday.
We'll be home in the evening
What You Take as a Press Secretary
old man, how often do you go to dinner at a expensive restaurant?
I'm going to the expensive restaurant for dinner once.
I'll try to explain everything to her.
So we liked it very much, and we wanted something brighter, so this is a better option.
I was in a room where there were many people, tired of energy.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, voice loss, weakness and head turn
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done this, but we've said who's registered in the April exchange of money at the end of the month.
We need a pass on Thursday, and we're going to the doctor with the kids.
But at night I wrote a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'm going to report it.
Working at the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental work that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicable, but marriage and marriage matters are serious.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that in order to create a family, people must love, respect, trust each other.
Right now, I haven't met.
Good morning. Where can I get the shape to pick up the paper or silicone?
All right, thanks for the advice, then I'll put a witness in the poll on Wall.
She's in bed, she's now a little broken in the hips, she's in bed, she's eating all over in the blender.
Mr. Reihard, I'm sorry to bother you at a time when you're out of your mind.
But I have important questions for you.
I went to the playroom in Natalie today, to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child because she said that she had come to look at the things and to arrange them in that room with the clothes and Mr. Valerias opened our baby room yesterday until 19:00.
Could that really be the case?
It's time to work in the room by 4:00.
And finally, it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a web page that's very weak.
Good day, we've got it all right) The bike works, yesterday, we filled out invitations, and I was with the senior before the exam in the gym.
The most difficult to grasp is the geometry.
On Saturday, Volodymir helped us.
Vicka studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We are very grateful for the housing
Yeah, but I thought you weren't full.
We're trying to get the maximum sum to the end of the week to figure out
The situation regarding Russian invasion is a briefing by the head of the Office of President Olexia Arestovic (10.04.2022)
The chief of the President's office advised him about the heroic act of the senior police officer in Mariupoli -- he was surrounded and wounded, so he broke himself off with a radio station so that she wouldn't get the opponent.
