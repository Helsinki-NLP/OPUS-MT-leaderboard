Petr Čech: The transition to the last minute?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still skip the transfer window and make a big break.
Another chance will come in winter.
Petr Čech, currently replacement contractor Chelsea, but now does not sit on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is about to be represented by the Czech general in the game with the Americans and subsequently also on the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea branch, in the new season, Primer League is privileged to Thibaut Courtois, Czech was first given a replacement position in ten years in the London club.
In time, it was speculated that the Czech might be interested in Real Madrid.
In the beginning of the season, the Spanish Superpozar lost in the battles with the Atlantic and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It also speculated on the interest of Paris SG.
In the French league season, the two matches and two regiments were fired on Sunday at St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively the most pressing boot club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance sheet in his league, and he broke up with Lille at 1:1 a.m.
Today, on bullfighting English websites, reports have come to the news that the Czechs might want to be in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, though, Czech departure from Chelsea for the last time is not too likely.
Skybet wrote on him a 4-1 course.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your dress over the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything about football.
Maybe during the day an offer will come that won't be rejected.
How would such an offer have to look?
(Laughter) "Well, I still don't know how such an offer that can't be rejected actually looks.
It would have to come to the agreement of all parties, above all, on Chelsea's position, whether or not the club would solve any offer.
Is it technically feasible to commit such an offence when you're in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere else?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are many players today, all of them are somewhere on the stage, and certainly there are still many crossings today.
So it's kind of feasible.
How many clubs on the planet could they afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing on the exit?
The situation where I didn't catch a new season in my first three games is a new career for me after fifteen years.
But there's no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue to take part in this fight on Chelsea's position and it's on the coach who chooses what decision he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision?
I take all the factors into account.
It's a sport perspective for me, of course, but I'm looking at it from the personal page that the family needs, of course.
Is it possible that you'd catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought would never concern me.
But it's all possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

According to the rapporteurs, India also hopes that both nations will agree on cooperation on defence issues.
Police in Karata arrested a 20-year-old boy after a motorcycle chase
They stopped the engine after they reached the maximum speed of 70 km/h and drove 125 km/h to the forest to get away from the police.
In the morning, the traffic police in Karrat tried to stop at the edge of the motorbike when they noticed that when they left the pump station at Bathgate Road it was 125 km/h.
According to the police, the driver didn't stop and continue after Burgess Road and then he went to the bus, so the police lost him out of sight.
The engine and the person who corresponded to the driver's description were then seen in the house at Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karath police accused a 20-year-old of disobeying the challenge of stopping and indiscriminate treatment.
He'll be in Carrat's court on September 23rd.
The motorcycle was fun for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be set up before the court for charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was indicted during the hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
Apparently 7 June 2013 at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire County had to rape a woman.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her while “she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent.”
In addition, Webster has been reached to rape other women at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn at the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of referral to the Supreme Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Renewal of a very American ideal that labour rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect civil rights in the committees.
"According to the functioning of the committees, jobs work for the middle class," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is co-chaired by the Congress Committee.
That's why I'm so proud that, together with John Lewis' temporary rights, I can introduce a law strengthening the position of employees.
This interim legislation gives workers the same legal option to prevent discrimination in the organisation of committees, as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-theatrical forces
To amend the Labour Relations Act in such a way as to enable all employees who face discrimination, if they want to be involved in committees, to be tried before a civil court - and to judge compensation or compensation for damage - is a proper and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other designers are proposing in the law is to re-attack to the American ideal.
Even in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries - the Americans have once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country had one breath of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their committees played a role in forming new Japan, including languages and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, to negotiate collectively and to act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers in the new nation would need to organize and promote, and therefore included clauses that openly say: “The right to create societies that will ensure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to every call or profession.
Agreements which will restrict or seek to harm this right shall be annulled. Measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose shall be illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global treaty, the proposers and Roosevelt guaranteed that "everyone has the right to create and enter committees within the framework of the protection of his interests."
The American generations have accepted the basic assumption that labour rights are human rights.
When countries were working with other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create working committees - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that workers must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone today knows that the forces of the nation have not diminished, but they have expanded it.
They raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack the committees forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of committees - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have raised America and made it a real commitment to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could have shut down all the paramilitary clinics in Louisiana
The federal judge temporarily blocked the Lousian law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five state-run clinics.
The order signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is in force on 1 September, would require doctors to accept a patient in a hospital up to 30 miles away from their practice.
The judgment of the judge means that doctors may continue to exercise their legal rights on a temporary basis and must, in the meantime, take care of this permit.
"The proposed party will be able to legally operate its activities and, in the meantime, obtain permission," says Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be planned within one month so that the judge can issue a more lasting resolution on the law.
Activists on the right to forfeit a resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that doctors would be given more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from a law of the past that is to be prepared for their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerned doctors from two clinics that were not among the applicants, and they also requested that this authorisation be granted.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, and the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures to be anti-constitutional.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's right to be harassed together with the Association of American Infants and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association claim that the need to have this authorisation is subject to medical requirements that are not necessary.
The protestors objected to the fact that the measures were intended to protect women's health and some also welcomed the fact that the measures would have closed the clinics.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights has indicated that only one doctor is allowed to lose in Louisiana.
If all the doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out the seizures, the doctor would also, in fear of his safety, stop the operation, the group said.
The Louisian authorities have indicated in their response that they would not punish the doctors who are implementing the losses while waiting for a claim to be filed for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, more frequent ovaries are killed in outdoor cancer.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video containing their deceased mother who died of egg cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying from egg cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1,100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with egg cancer and found that only 35% of the five years after diagnosis lived.
The head of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Susan Jordan, reported that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die than women in urban areas during the study.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines can slow lung cancer and egg cancer
Women’s researchers have been monitoring treatment for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the chance of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of carcinoma of the eggs, another existing disease and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was observed in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of egg cancer, Dr. Jordan claimed that factors could be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
"Unpower can best treat gynecologists who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services at a distance to overcome the barrier in the form of a distance, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen the transport service that allows specialists to treat women close to their homes and programs to support people who are being treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of the geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today published by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, the young mother of Elish Neave from the city of Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive form of egg cancer.
Gardening centers regret a reduction in the number of owners of homes
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary housing of owners of households under 35 years of age could lead to the achievement of "main age groups of gardeners" by today's young generation of consumers, with garden centres reaching up to ten million pounds per year.
According to the report, people who rent their own gardens are lost, on average, 55 % of the amount that is lost by people living in their own gardens.
As other dangerous factors in the sector, which earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, it indicates an increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the form of parking spaces instead of the suburbs used as a parking area and the size of the gardens decreases.
In the area of Great London, where the share of owned houses fell from 61% to 43% over the period of six years, one household is the lowest expenditure on garden products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society have stated that housing in the basement or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden consultant for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular flowering plant - when they move, the plants can take along with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of home owners and economic prosperity ranging from 80 to 90 years.
He also predicted a higher vacation this year due to better weather, which came under adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator speaks of democracy.
After Putin struck his youth organization, which reminds me of the most important thing, he saved with atomic weapons and basically revealed to everyone that their views were stolen from him, gave us today a lecture on democracy.
But I feel like the current regime in Russia is showing a lot of drawings of a fascist state.
The great nations have one common one, and that's that they can control it as much as drunk nationalism, and that the minority complex can transform it into imperialist chateaus.
It's probably gas time in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of the war on Europe was long gone, in the east it thought that they had been looked over for a long time and it was necessary to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration rule in Germany in the thirty years, just before the Nazi power was captured, followed by the explosion of nationalism in Russia.
And then that completely consistent cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is certainly quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly much of the Russians are about to die after Russia ruled half of the world and the second part was afraid of them.
Perhaps Western politicians blamed themselves, perhaps a little Vladimir was plunging on his shoulder, perhaps not inviting him to his place of interest, and perhaps starting to underestimate him, and he was merely acting like a typical Russian man.
He made an order at home, he pretended that he didn't even want to go anywhere and brushed the knife at home.
Now he's decided he'll get his lost position back.
It starts slowly, it's time.
The leader's probably alive, so where would he hurry.
The Kavkasana is being hunted, now the Ukrainians are being hunted, then they're in a row of pobalts.
The Russian bear has been in the skin for a long time.
China will be able to see this, and it will be able to jump out of the way, and it will surely be making its way to the far east.
And those Germans of the Vladimir are also pretty shitty about how well they're doing, and I put that on their ass in 45.
What to do with a new Novosia in Karl's Varech.
That would be the base, and ours are a lot of them, and how they're being pressed in there, and they're trying to get a liquefierte out of them.
Our veterans have long remembered the way they had in Czechoslovakia.
Now the vote is their Prime Minister, Mr Sobotka, he is so soft, he can be robbed like a brick and I'll eat their whole EU.
That'd be so fun to jump to big Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And we're going to use our roommates, who live in their territory.
There's enough Russians everywhere, and when they say they're stuck in there, they're just stuck in there and we don't let that happen, we're protecting them.
And again, the Russian will rule over what is born to another.
Europe is good only as a premonition on which proud Ivan can dance.
Turkey called for an American diplomat for a Spanish report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the highest-ranking US diplomat in the country to explain the report on the American and British espionage activities in Turkey.
The Vice-President of the Government of Bulent said that the US charge d'affaires and Turkish state officials had acted on the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to the documents provided by the former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was the priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was baggagetising the importance of the report and stating that all important states are monitoring each other.
The elder report, which also referred to the German intelligence service, called for a more heated response from the Turkish government.
Series Game of Thrones presents another fourth row tricks
The creators of the Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the tricks of the fourth row came about.
The most visible are the computer changes of the serial environment and the mass scene when the army of the famous Daenerys will become a noise of soldiers.
Police Director in Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence to the Mallorian State Prosecutor's Office concerning the expulsion of police officers and state officials from the resort in the Calvia area.
The chief of police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after the charges brought by the owner of the bar in the unrecognised party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by a number of businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where there is a majority of bars and night businesses in Magaluf.
According to the Internet newspaper Mallorca Diario, the complainants submitted evidence of expulsion from police officers and state council officials in Calvia’s self-government prosecutor’s office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police on the grounds of connection with the corruption charge and, together with Navarre, a judge was heard.
ABC's Spanish national journal quoted the unsatisfied owners of night businesses, according to which the public authorities have a significant impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money, it’s about survival,” said one of the entrepreneurs in the court.
Don't play with our habitat.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got on the main page of magazines all over the world after a video of eighteen-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, which during a tour of bars provided oral sex to 24 men.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to keep an eye on drinkers and excavators in a number of participants at holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of unrecognizable alcoholic tours by bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where there was an oral sex event, was forced to close for a year and, together with tour organizers, carnage will pay a fine of EUR 55,000 ($73 000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, which is particularly popular in Britain, was also a witness of many alcohol-related accidents including fashion waves known as balconing, where people jump from one balcony to the other or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
First spring day marked by rains and storms that affected the airport at Adelaide
JARO brought the South Australia ice surprises, came with strong rain and harsh winds, which seriously hit Adelaide Airport.
The next 5 mm of precipitation will fall in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and the next 6,6 mm will fall during the night of the week.
The last rain appeared along with a few short bumps associated with the storm and wind currents that began eight hours ago and brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After several timely spring doses came after winter, temperatures in the city dropped again on Monday at only 15.8 °C.
It is estimated that storm weather contributed to the late Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to arrive at 19:30, but at a short distance it was affected by a change in speed or direction of the wind and was forced to delay the landing.
Winds at Adelaide airport at this time reached the country at about 50 km/h.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to leave the second landing and finally reached about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently led to the delay of the next years, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Qantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast, the temperature in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two extrusions may occur.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the area near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in the anti-bomb shelters, while rockets and minamites were attacked in their homes during the 40-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the land is being remembered from the battles.
The beginning of the school brought to the community in southern Israel the marked attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of the battle are still visible.
In Ashdoda, a town in the south of the country, the school staff who were hit by the rocket removed the remains from the walls after the cracks and were allowed to wait for the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a native of the Saad kibucu and an English teacher at the local school.
Many children from this area need to really go back to their daily routine.
Her eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that "it's a little special" to go back to school.
"We lived a few difficult moments and we didn't even leave the house," she said.
Kibuc, located near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the population.
Until the ceasefire last week of the war ended, thousands of border settlements like Saad left inside their homes or homes and moved to safer areas away from Gaza to avoid rockets and mines.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a village close to the border with Gaza, where she shot a four-year-old boy from the Palestinian minomet, with a return weight.
The Minister of Education has stated that about twelve families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
The president of the Benjamin Netanyahu government visited the school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza, which was severely hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged his children to study diligently, and he added: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless basis last Tuesday.
The ceasefire, however, did not solve the key problems as Hamas' demand for the end of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reconstruction of the airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the armed forces of Hamas and the return of two soldiers from the battle.
The new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts and estimates that at least half of the killed were radical, although there is no clear evidence for this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including the Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired at Israeli cities mainly in the south of the country 4,591 rockets and fired from mines.
The Israeli army has again engaged in over 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and the estimated 250,000 people hid in hundreds of United Nations schools, which had become a temporary shelter.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of the ongoing struggles, they postponed the school officials last week early in the school year.
"I hope that they will soon open the school so that we can complete education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in the largest city of Gaza.
Bracelet: I'm standing behind the wax.
And Lafatu treats fever
The Czech football representation met this afternoon in Prague before the mid-preparation match with the USA and the next starting match of the qualifications of the European Championships against the Netherlands.
From the twenties of the camp, there are problems with the Spartan attacker David Lafata, who is suffering from temperature.
David isn't here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was about more players, and David probably had a little more problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," Professor Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it will be two or three days, or if it will be fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his health status, which our doctor will decide about," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has a disease, but it's not that they can't train or participate in a fight Wednesday with the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan hostage Lukas Vách.
He admitted that it was not easy to make decisions, considering other middlemen.
I decided that Lucas is a prospective player, 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I am behind it," Vrba said to Vácho.
What about Shural?
We'll see what's going to happen to Latato.
It is not excluded that in the case of health problems, appointments could still change.
About the weekend with a great performance, for example, the liberal Josef Šural, who gave the hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing shape lately.
We'll see how David Lafata's on it.
In the event that he cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot nominate any of the players who are interested in the Czech League," Vrba said.
This afternoon, a representative of the training team is waiting for you in Strahov, then on Tuesday, a classic pre-recorded training team in front of a duel with the USA on the Year, which will be open to fans and followed by autographs.
The battle with the Americans is on Wednesday from 20:15, and the national team in it will strive for the victory of the Prime Minister under the Vorba.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he won two medals and lost one.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on 9 September from 20:45.
The foot goes to the Netherlands to Italy
The point is, he likes to have more time to train than before.
It is an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we need not have much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on getting ready for the Netherlands as best we can," praised Vrba.
The Dutch will present themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy, and the duel will personally monitor the former temporary representative of Josef Pešice.
Gives us information that's from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a game and we're going to split it up.
A new coach comes to the Netherlands, we'll see what changes there will be," Vrba told bronze medalists from a recent world championship.
According to the highly monitored statistics, housing prices in the winter period have grown most in the last seven years.
According to an index of the value of apartments in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased by 1.1% in August of the housing price, the agency stated on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase of 4,2 % in June, June and August, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase fell to 10,9 %, more than twice a year by August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless has stated that Sydney and Melbourne are on the market.
The RP Data figures show that the prices of apartments in Sydney increased by 16,1 % last year, while prices in Melbourne by 11,7 %.
Other strong markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an increase in prices averaged between five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra, which was damaged by the State-designated expenditure reduction and where prices increased only by 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when the spring began, the number of real estates for sale will increase in the following months, which will be a real test for the market.
‘In view of the continuing high level of auction sales, overall high sales rates and low interest rates, the value of housing is likely to increase even further over the next three months,’ he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said, "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, who worked in the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry is trying comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melodies is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through "deep" therapy and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: ‘ Stop with this frame.
Leave the sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton -- when I was a kid, they were grown up -- went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of a glass of beer or a beautiful stroke in the cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life was a serious guy in a corner reading the paper.
Henry had recently visited Dudley's barbershop, and although conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life had to be for him.
There's more light in there today, but it's still dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth, where the flames are blowing and there's a lot of smoke and sweat.
Dad always walked into the bathroom and just lying there, and then he heard how slowly he started singing for himself, because he was hiding a sledgehammer.
When I went around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to enjoy his family, and I started to respect him more.
Even so, Henry survived childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hurt anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
When Mom was sick and she died, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who has Dawn French, made it possible for him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop "I love you"?
Don't keep hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
It's a great mom.
With French, who was married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of weight, and they started showing signs of sugar, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center and I also had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And unique.
No one wants to eat the carrot itself.
Change in the direction of Henry's career is perhaps reflected in his elegant, briefly cut beard.
After receiving recognition from the criticism of his Othella, he went down to the theater.
Comedy followed with mistakes and August Wilson's fleet.
It's a different experience than sitcomy and comedy that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage as he was giving someone a show, and he wrote about him at the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-70s: “For a long time, I was the only black copyist on TV.”
He learned to walk.
In addition to having to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn from the years 1975 and 1985 how to think about making fun, being a star and going on TV, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the right to make the show The Black and White Minstrel Show, a fun program in which the players were dressed as blacks, Henry finally came out of his comedy for five years.
My family wasn't there anymore.
I wish it never happened, but I don't want it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the lady.
What was "years and years appreciated the main product of British television", but was also "Grootian parodys of Blacks."
In the 1980s Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and presented figures that at the same time ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to be broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was also known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For decades, he received commercials, documents, television shows and roles in films, but after sending his Lenny Henry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said: "What you're going to do now, Lene, it seems a little bit like you're stuck in one place or you're meeting a little off the road."
Next in line was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't properly teach him at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
All those with whom we had a conversation, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't mind if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented 20 lines from Othello's final speech for the document and was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's giving me the courage.
“That’s about it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the trial was tough, and I've been reading the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
Looks like they're waiting for a leak, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in Comedy full of mistakes.
I was in the National Theatre all of a sudden, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical mess, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for entertaining the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before the computer is correct, you have to have them for ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the director announced that the performance will continue as soon as the problem is resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can fix it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotech in the Duchess Theatre
Learning the Plot text was a challenge.
Panika's pretty good, he's giving a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like God's sign saying, "This is what you should do."
Of course, that's what he says in the voice of the expert.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the test.
Henry, however, remains a comedian brain - throughout our conversation interrupts with humorous performances when he comes in and out of the role of the simulator.
I decided not to make a stand-up because having the satisfaction of a room full of foreigners is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get to the blind alley.
Sometimes, if I want, I do live at the Apollo, but I don't like it as before.
I was wondering if he'd ever set up a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in one room with the director, who helps to give the descriptions of the beginning, the means and the end of the journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm having fun with heredity.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to focus on non-existent employees
Kenya started a biometric registration of all her state officials to try to get rid of the government's non-existent employee payroll.
According to the Government, employees who are not registered in the following two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid after they leave the state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhur Kenyatta pledged to ban corruption in public administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state comes monthly at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) on the payments of non-existent employees and in the event of another abuse of official power.
The government is suspected that payments are still included in bank accounts and after the death of an employee or after the employee leaves the government, a BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Vanyama Chebusiri, reported.
All state officials must be supplied within two weeks to the identification centres where their data will be biometrically recorded, shall be included in the government declaration.
He goes on to say that anyone who doesn't make it without enough apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By providing actual public service employees with this measure, it will make a significant contribution to its disposal and will also be used to clean the payment sheet at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguer, Ministry of Development and Planning Secretary.
dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "screaming" against the government
The local media indicates that 33 police officers were detained in Turkey due to suspicion of "fighting against the government".
The police department has been commenting on the case so far.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-level officials were detained.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and phone answering.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the President of the government) marked their proceedings as part of the role of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gulen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to Ukraine to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the president of the government of Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he informed the reporters present that not all schools were reopened, but that it was decided to defend the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools, a traditional ceremony took place on 1st of February.
Not all of Ukraine is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukov, a teacher at the school in Slavyanska, visited Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated so that children wear fancy shirts, bring balloons and flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe the BBC found the boss for difficult times
Take with you a cloud of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal conclusion of the conservative party.
He's got his own background from the front lines.
The career began in the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the Pearsons media world.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned when her younger colleague, Pearson's, had the highest position in the parent company.
It's said that her distance was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: she became a consultant to the government.
Her husband is an ex-member of the City Council.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and multifaceted entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns two directions: inside to the top level hierarchy of the BBC's own management, but also out to the public's voice in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires a thorough reform.
But the director would risk coming to a company complex as a Chinese dynasty, disbanding it and preparing himself for work.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see how the BBC decreases -- its power, its finances -- and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the competition circle and the new technology questioning the old security, the immediate negotiation of concessionary fees for the BBC is a major threat.
For a modest amount of 145,50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC reports a good story: it claims that its production is 96% household and each one is only 40 p.m. per day.
In addition, the BBC format clearly stands: 53% of beneficiaries compared to 31% ten years ago.
The BBC service usage models have changed: Today my news headlines are displayed on my mobile phone and on the series I've been browsing, I can look at iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
The Texas governor Perry claims the offensive tweet didn't approve.
Tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was published on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a democratic state representative who initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published on Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous.
He left my account with a tweet that was not authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and I picked it up," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions right away.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is in fact responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an uncivilized, humorous picture of the state representative of Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to alcohol treatment in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which Perry, a potential candidate for the president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before the grand jury in Austin.
The tweet stated: “I don’t always drive three times as much alcohol in the blood as I’m allowed... but when I do, I regret that Governor Perry calls me to be responsible for this.”
I'm the most filmed Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perrym was not conducted by the Lehmberg Authority.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonia who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charge a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team requested a judge observing the case to reject the charge, since the application of the laws to bring proceedings to justice as long as the governor serving in Texas's history is inconclusive.
Perry stopped paying $7.5 million from the state fund for the division of public interest, which has its seat in Travis County and is committing corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal resulted in a formal complaint from a left-to-left group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes even celebrates.
After he finished his presidential campaign in Iowa in 2012 at the fifth place in the committee of his party, Perry replied to the speculation that he might already end up tweeting his own photo, running near the lake, and said, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns to normal
One of the most prominent London development companies warned that the housing market in South-East England had returned to the normal level of activity.
Housing in the main city was the subject of high demand and rising prices and extended credit bubble concerns led to the introduction of mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and president of the Berkeley Business Company, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point in 2013 has returned to the normal level of transactions." He adds that it provides "a stable environment for functioning."
The London housing market was well done during the decline because the buyers from abroad sailed to the main city.
According to the Catastrophe Authority, prices in the city increased by 18,5 % only last year, leading to an average of 6,7 % in England and in Wales.
The average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about five last year and rose to 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, for the sake of strengthening the librarians, it is not so attractive in recent months for foreign buyers of London's property - some of them also threatened the introduction of new property taxes and the possible "seasonal taxes" that came with the policies before the parliamentary elections next May.
London's real estate office Foxtons warned last week that a April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter loan rules, would also slow down the market growth in real estate and prices during the second half of the year.
The new Bank of England data showed a decrease in the number of approved mortgages per month in June, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, has reduced the price of the house by 3 % on the basis of a decrease in its forecast of growth in London's real estate prices for 2015.
The volume of transactions according to the real-time WA Ellis office, between London's most expensive districts such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, decreased by a quarter each year.
However, the demand for residence in the capital for Berkeley was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sales to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Piggley added: “The demand for the right, good-looking housing in the right location remained the same and, as a result, the forward sale was maintained.”
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the end of the crisis in 2007.
The annual profit before taxation increased by 40 % to 380 million pounds, by 18 % to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the annual meeting of Piggley, it was said that the annual results of Berkeley are expected to be in line with the current market expectation.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million pounds.
Berkeley's stock stopped at the London Stock Exchange this afternoon on 23.96 pounds.
Hacker on the Internet posted photos of our Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th anniversary of the Cen Academy.
Photos by Oscar Jennifer Lawrence escaped online because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" photo of another hundred starting toys.
"Hunger Games" spokespersons confirmed that the Lawrence photos are true and the hacker criticised "the obvious breach of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will reach out to anyone who steals photos of Jennifer Lawrence's public.
Hacker photos, which were originally published on the 4chan image sharing server, were reportedly obtained thanks to the interface in the Apple iCloud internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winsteado on Twitter also criticised the act.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at the pictures we had with your husband in private homes years ago are happy," Winsteado wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, however, is familiar with the cable TV series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were true. On Twitter she said: "These my alleged naked photos are PODVRH, people."
It's better to use it even in a puzzle.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that the speakers of the Ariany Grande pop stars denied that the alleged photographs would be true.
Extraordinary sample from Howard Jacobson's praised new novel about the love and the letter "J"
Dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually spread out as a cardboard box that someone left on the rain.
From time to time, a woman told him that she was too serious, complicated, rigid, isolated, and perhaps a little shy.
And then she shakes his hand.
He let himself be.
He was able to pee like a bear, yes.
The last victim of this ability was the beginning of a loving bond, more than she usually promised to remove him from the loneliness of life and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wildly hot hair and a hearty village on the northern island, which was even farther and more hospitable than Port Reuben.
The older company that Kevern thought was her aunt who inherited the property in the wet, but a beautiful valley called the Paradise Valley, as appropriate.
No one's been in the house for a few years.
The pipes asked, there were dead spiders in the baths, the skirmishers signed up on the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was vast and the plume remembered the huge heads of desire.
The house looked like a chaloupe of children's stories, scary and at the same time fascinating, full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations at the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The lower choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailin sat on the dissipating chairs in a long grass and held their hands, enjoyed an unexpected warm spring afternoon, were immediately overloaded by the public station, which the country had stocked with joyful music and soothing news, when in that regard he remembered the old song of a long forgotten black comic that his father had been listening to with the hidden rollers.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs on the radio have not been played.
They weren't forbidden, really nothing was forbidden, they just didn't play.
They helped them get to the desuétude, as well as the word desuétude itself.
People's tastes have proved what they would never have done without law, and like people with books, they choose memoirs in which the poor become rich, cooks, and loving Romans, so they choose ballads in music.
Kavern had to get off the floor and started playing on the imaginary piano and the rough, comical voice singing the series of Alline's big feet.
Ain't no head.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to push his letter before he got out of his mouth.
It started out like a game when he was a kid.
His father told him that the game was playing with his father.
When you were at the word that started on it, they didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it was a pen.
It wasn't very funny and it wasn't funny anymore.
He just knew he was expecting it, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailin's never heard of anyone.
No jazz, even though it wasn't built out of law, they didn't play.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There was only one place in life for one "if."
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
The same in humor.
His inescapability went to people's nerves.
And jazz was a humour expressed in song.
Although he didn't hear about Sammy Davis Junior until ten years ago, Kevern knew about jazz from his father's seminal collection of old CDs.
At least Alilin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember the time when the favorite songs were not black.
Also without laws or pressure.
A permitted company is one in which every part of it, with its gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were fortunately saved - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution danced for fun and athletics, and so sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if they were a natural gift for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The rest of the dishes were the installers, the Greeks, the rest of the dishes.
Those of the states of the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose ancestors quickly did not leave the country, while doing so, COSE STALO, KDYBY SE STALO - feared that they would accuse them of adding to the fire, in fact afraid that the fire would be spent the next time - opened their restaurants, where they were selling soap and smoking water pipes, not paying attention to themselves, and the inaction slowly fed them.
To everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailin had a hard understanding of how the simple words that Kavern just sang to her could produce music.
Music was the expression of love.
"They're really not empty," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden supplied a safe illusion.
Not even a word could be avoided after the soundtracks.
Ailin still doesn't get it.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he managed to put two fingers in his mouth again in her presence.
She thought it was weird.
"She felt funny," he finally said.
Unbelievably she shook her head and slammed Kevern's face.
There was nothing else in the world that could be seen but the muzzle of her hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said doubtfully.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't go like that.
Maybe some ankles...
You're saying you hate me because I have too fat ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles just attract me," he tried.
I'm a little sloppy.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble, because, like his father, he lost the spell needed to be able to reduce the cruelty that he had in his jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel.
Maybe he was an intentional cruel Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomon's brow and rose out of the bed, shared the radio and poured unspoiled wine.
No wine, so he couldn't drink for it.
She seemed to shake herself like a palm leaf in the storm in her dismay.
"It's very attractive to me that you're an asshole," she said...
Except it doesn't appeal to me.
She felt sorry for him both for his unpleasant words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did you think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but she didn't doubt that it was the same as it was here in the foundations.
The same broad and icy ocean was worried about them.
The same confusion of men, then, COSE STALO, even more unbearable and hateful than their ancestors, pastors and cassettes, blasphemous from the house to the house, prepared to raise their hand to any woman who would dare to refuse them or mock them.
Stupid?
If he doesn't pay attention, they'll show her their fists!
First of all, helping her - helping her became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the opposite of the soft ballads of love that radio screamed - first of all, they helped her, then one murder.
According to Kever's opinion, too much cultivation, because anointedness was about itself by acts of violence.
Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt so tired herself, but the pain of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched him leave -- as if she watched him from the window on the floor -- the man who realized what he was doing.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was broken for him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them had killed her.
The man turned away from it, his shoulder hung, humiliated, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she think that this view knew well, even though she could not afford the only moment until today that she would ever see it?
Ailin Solomons, herself, looked at her feet.
Some 20 years after these events Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic two-year researchers working in Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of mild and moderate violent acts in areas of the country where its mitigation or direct suspension was expected to be met with sufficient money and energy.
"It has done a lot and a lot more to do it," she wrote, "to calm down the native aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and most of them won, and above all in busy, hard-to-access places in the country, where even through the peaks of church towers coming out of the living fields of human kindness, historically appeared only rarely."
Some things, however, are irretrievable.
It might seem that the higher the tower is, the lower the pudding.
Citizens breathe over sentimental balloons, mock unhappy stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas, old brutality is being held as hard as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that there is new and aggressive hostility at home, at work, on roads and even in sports games.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too flimsy," her superior said.
I'd suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum took her head off.
I also have to ask myself, "Are you an atheist?
"I feel I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
We have regained our right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Keep it quiet.
"I'm not asking for that," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have any prejudices on this place.
We serve unaccompanied companies.
But some kind of hypersensitivity, which is completely acceptable and commendable to itself, can sometimes paint a judgment as you have imagined.
Obviously you yourself are bound to the Church - things that you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted as an expression of natural power and energy.
Keep solving what's been done, so it's been done, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it's preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the pink lightboard was the recommendation that Ofnow sent to the world in the last quarter or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicians, use your phone, chat, explain, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than talking, singing is better than writing, but there's nothing better than love.
"I totally understand your excuses," replied Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her superior had ended, "and I no longer claim that the morning was not as bad as we say it was.
My concern is above all that if we are not reminded of it in advance, we repeat the same mistake that led to what it was, what it was, what it was.
This time, however, we won't fan out on the others.
Luther Rabinowitz tied the fingertips.
That was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You stay too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that your ancestors may have taken and may not have done, you describe them as mistakes.
You're far too far away from talking about venturing your "object" and "infidelity" on the "other."
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting our presence, we are not talking about us and about them.
There were no "we" and there were no "them."
All we know is that it was chaotic times.
"During which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme took courage, "we are not innocent.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no fault that could be committed to someone, there are no things that should be corrected, no matter if correction was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past but that We may learn from it?
There's a past to forget about.
If I can add anything to that--
Luther Rabinowitz spread his fingertips.
"I will take your message into consideration," he said and missed it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on a walkway in a way that they described as "brut and deaf."
Accidents happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesoth claims that there is no plan - the president of the government remains in South Africa
The military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho denied that they would organize a march for the purpose of overthrowing the government and claimed that they were acting against the police suspected of attempting to arm the political fanatics.
The president of the government, Thomas Thabane, fled the country and said that the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maser.
After he declared that he was threatened with death, the prime minister and his family moved to the neighboring South African Republic.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's speech army said that it was not really a trick, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police tried to arm themselves.
"This morning, the command of the defenders of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several information services, that in a number of police there are several groups that plan to arm some radical, political fanatics who are going to make guns in the country," said the Voice of America.
The speech of the South African government, Clayson Monyela, said the military action looked like a attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that the government has taken over by force, according to all, the actions of the Lesothian defence components bear the mark of coup d'état," he said.
The military representatives of the kingdom of Lesotho said that the soldiers returned to their wives on Sunday and were at peace in the capital city.
During the absence of Thaban, he will be the government's responsible Deputy Prime Minister Mothejo Metsing.
The Thabane said in his opinion that there was an imminent attack because of my efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane has suspended Parliament's session for internal disputes, Lesotho has been in stress.
He declared that despite the wrong claims, he did not undermine his government's conduct.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of thirteen months
Production growth has slowed down to a minimum of three months, according to a carefully monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final index of buyers in the euro area (PMI) of June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 means expansion.
There were new orders and the factory damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures come from the European Central Bank (ECB) Thursday meeting.
Markets will require a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote recovery of the euro area and with a risk of inflation falling to 0,3 %.
It appears from speculation that the Director of the ECB Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he considered the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to that of the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than any growth, the freezing effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, the leading economist of Markit.
Germany’s manufacturing SME, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 11 months.4
In the second largest economy of the area, France, SMEs fell to 46.9.
Concern over France, Italy has gone back from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the moving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not too soothing," said Dobson.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to lead to a fire by analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where SMEs grew to 57,3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the production review of buyers for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: At present, producers in the euro area have a very complex life, because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the increasingly demanding conditions in many countries.
These increasing uncertainties have proved to be effective - and above all the consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those costly.
He stated that as "even more likely" appears that the ECB will finally have to carry out some form of quantitative release, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of hell of survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the threat from the vast school of children still suffer
Ten years ago, the Czech radicals at the school in Beslana in southern Russia were held hostage by thousands of people
During the suffering that lasted three days and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the animal service at school.
Just ten years after the terrible siege of the school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, warned the surviving heroes of the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, the children and parents were arrested and killed by fanatic terrorists, it seemed as the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy linked the east and the west, which in this catastrophic accident led to a conversation and a future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslana in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the animal service at school.
We have found wonderful young people who have suffered misfortune, even though the memory of hell - caused terrorists in them will live on.
What's their greatest wish?
So that the war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is over.
A girl trying to get back into a destroyed school gym
She was caught by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, just trying to get back into the bombed school gym after the bomb exploded in it.
The confused Aida desperately was looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
They panicked that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"My wife told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida once.
I had my legs from blood.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several operations, she felt that she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said: “The pain came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I'll have to do another surgery.
There's a piece left in my lap.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but certainly didn't destroy it," she said decisively.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
I'm going to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to our friends about it.
This pain is too big.
My best friend and future partner of Jer Gapoev's class were killed there.
As a kid, we played together, and we imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten the capture, but the memories are a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world are still remembering what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, as I lie in a school window, I say that a lot of people will see it first, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who ran away with a raindrop and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia children start school in seven years) and survived the school’s class decoration in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At that time, a seven - year - old said, “My mother told me that if an explosion occurred, I would lie on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid that she was dead, ran away, and saw the payboats, the baby fell by the hand, and ran away with the bullet.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, “Damir told me his mother was dead.”
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom and was lying in a hospital with an injured leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son was dead.
After they met again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and surrounded me.
Damir then traveled to London (according to missing news news of the World), where then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The threat is coming back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories are already pale.
I remember right after I threw all my guns at the game.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard with and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
For a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted in the playground and how I was riding a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where he's suffering as he and his friends have suffered for the war.
The threat comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," said Damir, who participated in volunteer activities in the monastery last week.
I want a lot of help.
I want to work with the police once, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember it quietly after the attack, and there were no children who would scream and run here, and it took a few months.
He remembers his life on the road with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her reward for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember Damir's taste at the bourbon, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember you playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month since the threat.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think that the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it was, and there's gonna be a lot of kids killed.
They're kids like ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in reports that they'll hear when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what people are experiencing, what they're afraid of.
I still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet kid, he's not aggressive or stubborn at all.
For example, he doesn't apply for revenge, he doesn't even care.
I know she doesn't like to remember that, but she's very close to six associates and she's going to the gym from time to time and they're burning candles in there.
When he was younger, he had problems with that - I remember how he used to lie on his couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes he used to lie down for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had his eyes open.
I also remember that he threw out all his guns or other weapons to play. Damir is 17 today, is higher than I, pretty, smart and healthy.
It's hard to believe that I've been certain for several hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw hell, there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boyfriend didn't have this hell chance to survive.
“I remember shouting, ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced that I did not hear.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives are different from others.
Grigory Ilyn, 17
The boy whose photograph was taken after the attack became a symbol of the threat in Beslan
Comfort: Surviving from Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, Grigory's device today
When he fled for life after a Czech terrorist shot his associates, he was terrified in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had his first day off at school and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists knocked on the door, so my boy stayed there alone for three days," she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
He only survived my Grigory.
As the date gets closer, it's still harder to think and talk about it.
It won't even take a day to remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated as Socha (right)
I remember when Grigory was so excited about school that he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino, there's even a cry of Grigory.
Grigory's looking at the picture, and we have her hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that because of this picture, people around the world know how pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt that we will ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing accident in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what was the cause?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, they don’t want war, as it is possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little bit, it takes ten years.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and associates who were killed.
That's why when it comes to September 1st, I'm going to the gym.
I want to honor childhood friends' memory.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a past.
I won't forget it, but I won't.
My life is going on.
I finished school this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't be healthy.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, though kept him at the foot of a murdering terrorist
Surprise: Gregory Farniyev was held at the foot of a killer terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When he was attacked in a full-flow, he was arrested in a gym, sitting next to the bomb at the foot of a killer terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injury he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw at my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that kids with bad experiences can do better - I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I went to a psychologist and then I was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year later - it was the first and last thing I entered the gym again.
I'm out of my mind.
I'll never go there again and please don't want me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on the notebook with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
This pain is huge, and I don't have it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never ask me at school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I've hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
But I couldn't go out for health reasons and study at the FBS Academy in Petrohrad as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me that it was not possible.
My next move is animals, so I went to the vet.
I made a second year out there.
It teaches how to treat all animals from the "big after cow".
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something children should know about, and it's not something they should live with.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This disease will still be here.
He's inside and he's getting worse with the coming year.
I'll take part in the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was different from me.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's grown up today, but the threat goes on.
It's hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has performed several operations, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that's how 50% he'd overcome the fear, but he's going to overcome it completely and not forget it.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
Many of our friends and neighbors were killed during the attack, and the pain only exacerbates.
I lost a lot of people that I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but I'm in pain of losing the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who have not remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world -- wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we've been a friendly country, so how did we get to the fact that we're fighting together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could take all those rebels and throw them away, as long as it goes.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
Child who took the security special command
Protected: Alyon Tskaev takes to the Russian safe special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world sank into the air when little Alyon was delivered in a handbook from the Beslanian occupation by the Russian police.
But the terrorists abandoned her, leaving her 30 - year - old mother, Kristina’s ten - year - old sister, and her brother, Makhar, in school.
Makhar, who was then three years old, fled, but Alyon's mother and sister died during the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and had a little girl named Kristina after her daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, doesn't even remember the attack and grew out of it a bright and happy girl.
A close friend declared that “it is a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from memories that the tenth anniversary recalls.
You can understand why.

4 tips how to order better photos and videos
If you are interested in drawing or filming under the water, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact, for example Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I ordered these photos for a family celebration of several photographers, all worth less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieving the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will set up.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can get with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only to 5 feet, another to 50 to 60.
Read our guide through the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in the usual and waterproof implementation.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't come out.
Compact cameras have LCDs that help you with the composition photos, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, under the water, it'll be bad to see and the composition of the picture will be unpredictable.
So always do more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different resolution of the exposure, use it.
Stay close to the cold.
The deeper the light, the deeper the light dies.
If possible, stay in the swimming pool, lake or sea near the level.
This will also allow you to capture more light on photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
It's a great advice if you take a picture of the drought, but under the water it's even more important because of the darker light.
It is especially important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the point, which means that if you want to fill a photoframe, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality has been able to change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to removing disease and treatment from the sick.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an officer of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of the torture that had left him frozen.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, patients treated in the blood mostly care for something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was the one who started to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He was confronted with the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and his wife, Juliet, included in the rumors.
He noted: “I want everything to be done sooner than later.”
When Juliet went on a service trip for a week, Lawson was unusually upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague made him an X-ray.
Once a couple of weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came in.
He had mesothelioma, an irreparable tumor that affects the mucous membrane or the lungs.
In most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
But the mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the exposure of asbestos - a construction fibre that was previously designated as "beautiful", but today it is known that it is deadly.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mesothelis.
asbestos, finally, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in Britain since the 1960s when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only a few groups of people came into close contact with it, such as isolates, builders, treasurers, and shipyard workers.
Toxin used in the industry in another era today is hard to show as a reason for concern.
Such selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, in Britain today, the mesothelioma epidemic is at the top.
The number of deaths in mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths per year are twice as many as the victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths per year of mesothelioma since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we feel his effects right now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all kinds of asbestos were finally prohibited in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades before the mesothelis develop.
The mesothelioma is not limited to the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still, present in homes where we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in shops where we buy.
So mesothelioma does not respect social levels, wealth, vocations, or age.
The privileged gardens from London’s business houses after public schools do not pretend to hide.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even hospitals in which we should be treated are storage sites for this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put in isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he could come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It's possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basements of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors and returnees used walks.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he could answer in part.
"For four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital who then showed up to mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
Weakness is always mortal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question, “How many of us are sick with the same illness? ”
According to a leading British expert on the mesothelimus of Professor Julian Pet, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people die.
Most of them at the moment have no idea that they will die in this way.
Azbest's work in Quebec, Canada
On a regular look at the records of the courts which the injured often turn and require reconciliation, it shows how much mesothelimic decay has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she had exposed the asbestos to Janice Allen out of negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched two sales in the clothing section - one of the places was a flagship company, a shop on Oxford Street.
Allens were only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today she has two children who have more than 20 children.
"I'm going before it happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I've never even been dreaming that he might have anything to do with me.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
Actually, it's not asbestos, it's a group of six minerals.
His name was given thanks to his fibrosic structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
The most common is found in buildings today, usually known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boilers and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, however, the EU and WHO consider it "a great health risk", which can cause death.
More dangerous, but it's brown asbestos (masit) and blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing, but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of an unusually high presence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Employee Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the flag shop at Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not consider himself a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peta's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “substantial part of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by the "normal use and ventilation" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government do not have to know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that states that service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee's premises are contaminated with asbestos, whose mortal fibers could be damaged by something as harmless as "a strong airflow."
Ministers are often accused of taking care only of their own interests, but in this case the truth may be the opposite.
Although Parliament's Services Directorate has insisted that the Westminster Palace receive "good medical certificates", it is now expected that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to be carefully monitored by Parliament, modernized and removed asbestos, and that after the 2015 elections, the MPs will be sitting in the areas of the Queen's Conference Centre in Westminster rather than in the Green Houses of Westminster.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations."
It's not possible to say if this mess is going to happen.
Everybody can just wait.
One of the people who have never been able to determine when asbestos was exposed to them is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) has a suspicion that asbestos was exposed at work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places where he worked, and when he worked there.
Of course, he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was hit by something like a cold.
He was 45, he was night and he was just in the middle of the operation.
I broke up all of a sudden.
It's gone wrong.
I was terrible.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the chest, the joints around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, he had no reason to think it was a mess.
He finally spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made him an X-ray and brought him a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent him to discuss.
Still, they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition improved slowly and returned to work.
From time to time, though, his symptoms returned, often after he practiced and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and got into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT images and X-rays with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was in the space between the chest joint and the lung joint introduced by the probe equipped with a camera.
I'm optimistic.
I tend to take nothing too much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it's a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started meeting with the Macmillan charity sisters and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that point, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been used extensively, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos heat insulation in the pipes," he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now becoming sick.
So mesothelioma is now starting to affect younger people who do not have a risk call.
The most dangerous tubes of heat-insulated asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be in danger.
However, staff who walked underground between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basements (such as Graham Abbott) certainly came in contact with the toxic substance.
As it turns out, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Azbest's getting rid of it today.
The students of Bunsen's kahan built on asbestos floors
And it's not just about the hospital.
asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and consultants because of its excellent insulation and non-heating properties.
At school, too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry students built Bunsen's kahan on the asbestos floor.
Websites dealing with the question of asbestos in schools were raised.
Unfortunate things such as floor tiles or roofs on tools in our homes usually contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison built in a large number of homes," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his complaint against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember was in the 1970 ’ s when she was fighting a garden home.
So be careful how you beat the garden home.
Knowing that disease is untreated, the impact of diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while before you do," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I was going to have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I can't get another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the shift from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As an unnumbered number of patients before him, he remembers how he felt confused with the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been told that for twelve months.
I remember saying, “Well, I don’t have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is especially destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive -- the breathing itself -- is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Azbeth is a small fiber.
When asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can be placed in the trunk, the lung exhilarator.
The asbestos fibers are rusty, and they can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is the inspired asbestos fiber in needle form," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who went to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is a paradoxical center of mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson knew and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during the practice in the hospital.
Asbestos get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “a lonely breath is the pressure on the outside where the exhibit is located.
They've been invasive since the beginning.
In mesothelium, the usual treatment options used for other types of cancer do not include so much.
For example, the lightning is discussed on the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, she'd be tempted.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the necklace," he says.
You won't get any scalpel around her.
Cancer "does not respond too much to chemotherapy", which is "having some effect", but does not cure.
“Sometimes there is someone who survives lung cancer,” says Treasure.
But in the end, everyone dies.
Fortunately, some patients live a long time longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years from his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counsel for the same affected people.
When they called, he joyfully introduced himself: “Good day, you called at the cancer center.”
"It was very positive," said Abbott.
His disability was diagnosed four years ago and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and probably only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson, however, "was able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the breast surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait until I was sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application, and they would have to approve the compensation.
For patients with mesothelioma, the question of money is key to getting the best treatment available.
But when different treatments are finally inevitable, many patients face another financial care - about the future of the family they leave here.
And that's why they turn to court and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan with Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960 ’ s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet a non-conventional firm.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full settlement", because Lawson couldn't definitely prove that the mesothelis were the result of the exposure of asbestos in Guy's Hospital.
After the case was investigated, however, the speaker Guy's Hospital confirmed that "the asbestos in the incriminated subterranean part was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Degrading mortal asbestos exposure to one company or place of work - usually decades after this happened - has proved to be a major problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former jobs have changed or damaged owners.
Evidence's lost.
And those who are now accused of defending themselves have a time on their side, which their defendants certainly do not.
In response to this fact, this year an important new legislation has been adopted, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek redress, even if it is not possible to search for their former employer.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve, built by insurance companies, which is designed for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to complain about.
In such a case, 80 % of the amount that the court would normally call them to account for - approximately 120,000 pounds.
Every year 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, believes that 350 million pounds is "good work".
"It is an agreement signed by insurance companies," he says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time and people with mesothelioma were able to feed ex-employers and to sue them in a normal manner.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps."
But Penning and Morgan admit that, in view of the seven deaths each year, rapid negotiations were necessary.
"People are suffering too much and need help immediately," Penning said last December during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdonski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended the Lang-Lazduński operation, which he considered to be a positive effect unlike Tom Treasure.
Following surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were followed - a triple treatment that can lead to a survival rate of up to 40% of patients with Lang-Lazdunski.
Abbott sent it.
"Of course that's not the most important thing," said Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott took part in the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Control checks showed no signs of disease.
I went to another check in March [2014].
In my chest, I had a few broken ribs.
My 50th birthday was just getting closer.
It's not a life threat.
Just take it.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of tumor in his body.
But it's a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show my wife how the wake on the boiler works.
When you get the bad news, you start being negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and savage.
She told her friends, and suddenly we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more persistent.
She didn't say much.
All patients with cancer must face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not delayed by hope or just a sign of survival.
Miserableness brings with it (and finally brought to Stephen Jay Gould) dissatisfaction.
As Andrew Morgan says, "life is not a threat to mesothelis."
The bodies of embalmed Pharaohs are packed into the asbestos plate.
The asbestos fibres are used to strengthen the cookers and increase resistance to the fire.
The old man's lungs describe asbestos.
She was found to be a non-combustible fabric.

In Italy asbestos starts to appear in commercial use and is used to produce paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Great asbestos valleys open in Canada and South Africa, soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it is an excellent insulation substance in steam engines and turbines.
The world's production of asbestos is rising to more than 30,000 tons a year.
Prudential insurance statistics identify higher mortality among people working with asbestos and are then denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the asbestos particles in her lungs “were undoubtedly the cause of her death.”
This is the first case of this kind.
Employees of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, refuse responsibility.
He won't pay any compensation.
During the second world war, ships are built intensively, the work in the ships represents the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for damage to health as a result of the exposure of asbestos in Britain.
The world's production of asbestos increases to more than 4,213,000 tons annually.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires all suppliers of asbestos to be licensed.
Imports and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
In Britain, the use of all kinds of asbestos is prohibited.
The law on mesothelioma shall enter into force in the United Kingdom.
The 350 million compensation program has been launched.
asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as cheap construction material.
World production is held on two million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong authority to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
The Chinese Parliament, in spite of the multiple debate on democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
This step is likely to result in a long promised protest in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began to organize and catch only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows Communist leaders to issue any candidate that is not loyal to Beijing.
"It may not surprise us, but it upset us," said Lawyer Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned to Hong Kong's Chinese administration, Beijing has promised that it will start in 2017, the population will be able to choose the executive power.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders hold firmly to the nomination process of the Committee, which is closely controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which marked one of the biggest and most followed protests in Hong Kong for several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the movement of the occupation of the Centre with love and peace, which the organizers have threatened to close the financial quarter unless Beijing grants them universal voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the movement of the occupation in the rain gathered in front of the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers announced that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that the wave of protests is taking place in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Centre only as a last step in the event that all options of dialogue were exhausted and no other choice would arise.
We must announce with policing that today all the options for dialogue have been exhausted and the centralization is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing themselves for Beijing's announcement all day long, and on Sunday, they have strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters and have deployed police and barricades.
According to many Hong Kong residents, causing anxiety is a sign of a slow loss of control over the city.
The history of people from the fortress increases competition in the field of products and services.
There are also concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are increasing by pressure from Beijing.
Some people are criticizing the Central Employment movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - the Hong Kong rescue boat.
"The protest that they are talking about could cause much greater economic damage according to how many people are involved and for how long," says Regina Ip, a politician who criticises the long-term movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could damage the investment.
The Chinese state media has also reported in recent days that democratic activists in Hong Kong speak as subversive Western-led agents.
During the summer, activists organised an informal referendum on voting rights, with 780,000 participants - more than five volunteers in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
Pre-election agitka?
The League in Jihlava bears the name according to political movement
In the town of Vysočina, a small mine is played by some 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is newly called Joint for the Jihlava League.
The name was given according to one motion that goes to the October municipal elections.
He's also the boss of the little digger in Jihlava, Jan Mrák.
"There was an empty gathering where there was no problem with it," the Dark said.
The situation around the first league of small dignitaries has already been addressed by the lawmakers of the Yugoslav Council and recommended changing the system of distribution of grants.
A small miner won about a million crowns from the city's web site last year.
And this year it's about hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not minor in conflict with the law or the guidelines of the magistrate.
The situation is, however, an incentive for the Authority to amend the grant and grant rules," Radek Tulis spokesperson.
Throwing grants from the city and at the same time expressing support as a small mine in the elections of one political party, it's probably not going to work anymore.
The high-level "big" football is a similar requirement from politicians so far.
That ČSSD should result in a country change, ODS division or KDU-CSL 1.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for that.
On the contrary, I would be pleased if sponsors from a number of companies were to turn to us," noted the president of the regional football team Miroslav Vrzáček.
Head of small football on the other side and move to the name of the league won't let
According to players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, tents and social facilities.
"For example, the game on the stairs is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ondřey Lapeš of the Starlet Jihlava Club.
The most suitable locality would be the Czech mill.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a pointless area for skaters, which is about fifty in Jihlava," the Dark said.
Primátor Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that a small bath uses a field with artificial grass in the streets of Rosky and On Stoopách, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are going to modernise or build sports areas at schools that will be available in the afternoon hours.
I think that in recent years, for a small bath, huge progress has been made," said Vymazal.
The other political parties in the name of the League do not appear according to Jan Dark.
We have limitations.
If someone in one field joins us, then we don't do the other anymore," he explained.
"Political movement in the name of the league, I consider it a minimally unfortunate step," said a member of the Advisory Committee on Sport Karel Voldán.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr. Moraka is using the small mining company Jihlava and supporting cities for political purposes, or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life - champions can fly by plane
We are pleased that we can answer the request by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression at the university, the company also offers the possibility of transporting a private tricycle or a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also announced that the service has its own security page.
Service is the ideal option for students who otherwise have to drag their things across the whole state in a dangerous car loaded.
We are pleased that with our VIF (very important hairdresser - very important element) variants this year, we will ensure that students will arrive at the university with minimum nervousness and maximum luxury.
The speaker said that, given that the services had just dropped, they had no reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations over the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students apply an annual school of 9,000 pounds, they expect the service to take their place on the market.
Compared to students ten years ago, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different about expectations and desires - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticised the service as inconvenient.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is inconvenient.
Many of the students attending this month's university must be able to cope with the financial crisis before spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving on the track, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot take a step towards the underlying needs.
Feminists face racism and police behaviour after the Ferguson events
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson killed an unarmed young man in Missouri.
The present ones who wait for a funeral with their hands up and say, "Hand up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri about the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz recorded the movement in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when reproductive rights and income equality are observed, white feminists prefer sex before race.
With increasing tensions in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Peréz noted that the whites’ reaction is 100 % focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of black people shortly after the shooting of 9 August, personal articles with headlines such as “the idea of whitening over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not only about women’s suppression” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is a major change.
"I don't think there's a lot of people in feminist movement who would talk about race and opinion at such a level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to be said.
For the crisis we face, it is characteristic, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially saved that they had to pay attention to it.
According to English professors at the State University of Ohio Korithy Mitchell, Ferguson has brought out problems that African Americans have to face every day and that are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and get it 150 people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about coloring in my own country, it's a quiet distasteful.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relations, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there are no questions of race and sex of the dichotomy.
According to her, blacks could not afford luxury to share these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although the whites today question race and sex in mainstream feminist circles coincide, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black people were lynched and the reason was almost all cases of white violence," Hattery said.
For reasons of lynching, you needed to cooperate with the whites.
According to Hattery, the gap between whites and blacks came when the fighters for election rights like Susan B. Anthony studied at the end of the 19th century field and realized that election rights can have only one group of people - women or blacks.
"They decided to place their cards on voting rights for women and the right to focus on blacks later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important view of why color women don't believe in whites.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained election rights in 1920, it took ten years before they began to organize anti-nursing in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Rushing.
The group emerged 40 years after the blacks first said they were helping.
According to Mitchell's response to the questions that took place in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "get to" the questions that black people faced for generations.
"It wouldn't be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] had the right to raise a child just as seriously as they had the right to an anti-conception?" Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now finding out what that means.
Significant feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown's attack on Facebook, where they published a column of Rebecca Carroll from the Guardian, who demanded that white Americans protest more violently against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding dangers in society - and opinions on race that differ significantly in public opinion - will try to change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem is a cross-sectional feminism, which includes questions of race and sex, her comments on the question of race in the Americas are made by some people.
Experts from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who stole feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young color men, are "a lot more vulnerable than their sisters", but the comments of the Stonem Party of Ferguson face criticism that she had already called.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program, which had the help of vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The relationship of the police to the Black Community is not the only problem that comes in front of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police held nearly 63,000 young people in the South-West of the country this year without a follow-up, the question of immigration laws reform was raised again - this time as a female question.
Andrea Mercadová, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to be able to address the issue as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercado.
In view of the fact that most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have an announcement in women's organisations," she said.
Pets place in Ipswichi for sale
The real office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it was resting on it in a pig’s living room.
The one-room separate house, which is for sale for 120,000 pounds, stands on a private road in Ipswichi.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig’s couch.
The real office of Connells stated that the pig on the photograph is a pet pet of the owners.
"The photo was wrong there, and that's why it was already removed," the speaker's office said.
In the real estate information, the real estate office Connells described the former prayer as "the only single single-room house."
Although the photo office has already removed from its website, promotional materials still appear.
The sale of the house caused interest on social networks where some asked whether the pigs were included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has a city on the southwestern side of the winter millionaire.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
There's a search for a new million in the South-East of Perth, and a lucky guy from Saturday's lottery draw will take 1.1 million dollars home.
Traffic in Harvey had already doubled over five years, last November 2009 was one million dollars' prize.
Honest winner must first sign up.
The owner of the store Steve Forward said he was talking about winning the whole city in South-West Perth.
It's the main theme, and everybody's upset.
We thought a similar victory was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split one win last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five millions in August and only a few weeks earlier in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning twins sat down for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the only 59th lottery winner in Western Australia this year, totaling $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
The GDL in the press release marked a protest for the warning rate for which it was approved to select time outside the transport point.
At the selected time, the GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend to the railway station until the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people who are on their way to work during the day," the board said on Monday morning in a press statement to declare the statement.
"Our first stage should mainly affect freight transport, less passengers," added the GDL.
DB has not yet published an official response to the statement.
It is not even clear how protesting actions will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The committees require an increase of five per cent in the workforce and a two-hour shorter working hours per week.
At present, the average wage of engineers varies depending on the years worked between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to enter the growth of wages when the working time is shortened.
They stress that the wage evaluation of engineers must be developed as with other railway personnel who are not counted by DB as a minimum working week.
She threatened that Christ's car would start burning.
That's why Barum's rally is over.
What exactly happened?
It was a material flaw.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like that could happen.
Could the exhaust not be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace to the service where the mechanics would exchange it?
If we were to go straight there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two more essays, and it didn't work.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk that the car would start burning was big.
I can't afford that.
You've completed five speed tests.
What do you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a cold.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the wine.
Everything was caused by we hit the car more than half a year to be at some level.
The race proved to be a success.
You've spread it so you could have really thought about winning.
I made myself a car so we really had a win.
The work didn't come out of nowhere.
On the other hand, the result we could think of did not come true.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the peaks that got out of the fight for the first time.
They've come out of him and the foreign favorites of Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did you get surprised that so many favorites have gone away?
Yes.
It was a pity, especially for the spectators, because the race ended in time.
Jaromír Tarabus, the one you're going to drive, was moving at the peak for a long time.
He only paid for getting out of the street and took a nearly two-minute absence.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat the winner's degrees.
He's had the first time.
But Mira also confirmed that we found the car well.
He's going too fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, although you showed up at the start of Barum rally.
Could it be a good feeling for you to make a regular participant in the rally races again?
Not right now.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I didn't get it.
I decided to take her again.
It was my present nineteenth start, and when there's a chance again in a year, I'll probably go.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have come to the loss just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To some extent we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's up with you guys, Barumce?
The team continues.
Next week we'll go to Vyskov, where Robert Adolf will run.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
Besides, he wants to borrow from us this race from Honza Sykora.
Mira and I are waiting for a European double race in Switzerland and in Corsica.
We're gonna have to catch things next year.
Can you point something out?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsica rally belonged to the world's championships, you reached your top in the fifth place in the series.
Doesn't it make you try that trail again?
Don't laugh.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not let yourself be exposed to a doctor's confirmation of inability to work, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform your duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately inform the employer of your absence.
As a result, it was agreed that these days would be indicated as a vacation, but the agreement only went orally.
Although the employer does not have the obligation to have a written confirmation of the employer's consent with the allowance, this procedure has been certified in practice.
If there's only one oral agreement, you don't have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the discharge may be granted, as in your case, supported and absenteeism in the work may be considered as a long-term unannounced absence, therefore the reason for the immediate termination of the working conditions under § 53 of the Act of Labour.
In the case of a judicial dispute concerning an agreement with your employer, proof is missing.
The working relationship with you has not been deleted according to § 53, you have only the days specified in the statement as an unannounced absence.
Undeclared absence in the statement of revenue does not have the same effect as § 53 (e.g. the possibility of obtaining substantial unemployment insurance), yet it is difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and let yourself be confirmed in writing that there has really been a loss, as a result of which you have been unable to work (some of the so-called "insomnia" is just a doctor's evidence).
If you are looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the presentation of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, the rapid notification of the employer or the request for written consent with the discharge allowed.
You're avoiding any complications like that.
Tony Stewart's accident back on track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart only a bit behind half the Atlanta Motor Speedway racetrack.
During the 172nd round, Stewart suddenly hit the ball, and the race for him ended.
Stewart drove a ruined car to the garage, didn't speak to the reporters and left.
The boss of his team Chad Johnston said the car number 14 was disappointed, but he will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we're going to hope we're going to have more.
Stewart went to play first in the Sunday evening competition after a row with Kyle Bush, which asked for the right side of his car to be repaired.
"To this day's race we put hope in a good marriage," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get the place in the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took Stewart to the race.
The authorities said that the investigation of the cause of the accident would take at least two more weeks.
So far, it hasn't been decided whether Stewart would face any charges.
The three-way champion reached a hot boost before the race.
Stewart started at the 12th place, worked at the 10th at the start of the race, and then even at the 4th.
Then, at the beginning of 122, Busch's car number.
18 got out of control, got out of the second gear, and hit Stewart, and sent both of them to the parking lot.
Stewart went on, but he got down to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi driver, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new taxi manager.
In 103 parking lots, about 12.3 million crowns per year.
Today, for the same seats for the cab driver, 150 thousand crowns have been selected each year.
He briefed the Council of Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
The city used to be used for the selection of administrators.
The winner then got a rent for a small amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
At present, he is deciding on the number of bids.
"The year since the opening of the original leases and the start of the selection procedure has shown that the new rental system is far more beneficial and more equitable for Prague," the council said.
The most expensive spot is in Perština
The highest price was offered by interested parties on the street in Perštín.
He'll pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
About 1.5 million crowns have been paid by new administrators for seats in front of the General House or at Václav Square.
The new rules for rental of taxis services were adopted by the Council in autumn 2012 and the original rental contracts were announced last year.
The selection process was conducted in four waves and a new manager found 29 posts.
We've had to clean the fridge for the first time this year.
We've always let her go, and this is what caused a practically second fisherman around the cabin.
Then we found Savo.
Incredible smell!
Our barn in the store has always been filled with beautiful vegetable water.
And it wasn't someone's professionally done, Grandpa got her help.
Long time ago.
She was just on three laps and she's totally ugly, like everything else in the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the summer.
When we started the season, of course we drained the water.
When she got there a number of months, she deserved it.
But then it seemed to us that the water wasn't getting any water.
We thought if something didn't happen there.
In the place where the pump was going through, it was possible in a bit of grief, the board was not quite there, so the door was locked with a piece of silence.
Our inspection confirmed that there was a brick move.
Otherwise there was nothing to see in the water, and we lighted it down to the bottom.
So we let her out again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we improved the improvised tightness around the pump pipe.
We noticed strange things in the store.
On the ground, there was a glued package with some bones.
At least it looked like it.
And then another piece.
Now it looked like an oscillated mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where streams, Grandpa's inventions, there were the rest of the fish!
And it's hard to eat!
Our store's cool, too.
Someone would have said that Grandpa was undercover for a short time.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and floors are just a dusty sand, only the ceiling is covered.
There's a main ship going.
And the car.
And a beach bed.
The door with wide spaces was mostly open as someone walked there in one piece.
At the roof of a few already mentioned passages.
No network, so they usually fly there and build nests on the plots.
It's unnecessary to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to run, and that's it again.
Now, of course, the air didn't help.
The whole store smelled.
So we cleaned up the whole store.
Especially the fish on the tray was nutritious!
We also threw out things that were around: wood, heraclytic board, and so on.
Our chat on the far side welcomed by a fading disinfectant.
We've been thinking about who could get us those disgusting remains?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here all over the place.
It's hard for her to go to bed with us.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not quite okay.
If this French guy didn't get us the shit out of there, did he?
He's been around for almost a year, he's got a stupid idea.
We decided to watch the store and check the fridge regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, so long as we only washed and washed before the tests were finished, but it was good.
Pulling water from the forest shed is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
One day, we heard a terrible nightmare of our pheasants.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw in the grass next to veranda a long black hazel.
The line jumped over her and she peeped like a fool.
Her mother took her out because she thought Réza was digging a garbage dump out of the washroom.
Suddenly, however, the snakes were partially thrown into the club and partially pushed in.
There's been a collision on the balcony.
Reza got a hysterical seizure.
We ran down there.
She was going to take a huge oil and Réza to protect her from it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save her arm or if she wanted to eat it alone, but it was irrelevant.
When she saw the transmission in the shape of our entire family, she probably said that we would eat it when we were so hungry, and she had an elegant passage to the store.
We were flying for her.
It's like a flash jump for the cold.
Just like that, we've recorded on her desk another smelling package.
It's like a fish.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new security was pumping around.
And that's what we closed the store in the day.
That he would...
We went out and each of us ran into one stream.
We haven't waited a long time.
For the cold, it's embarrassing.
At first, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole mess broke out on the fridge.
She wrapped around the pump and started getting inside.
The fired employee bought a notebook and sold it to the company.
The buried employee bought it on the computer company after the release and then sold it.
The money you got came to lose before the police were arrested.
During a short time, a man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for over two hundred thousand crowns.
"After taking over the notebooks, he drove to Olomouce, where he was selling after the bazaars," said the top police commissioner of the Sumperian Police Rostislav Brückner.
For reasons of fraud, the employer was responsible for the release and also for the profit of money.
"When he questioned us, he claimed that he used the money for loan payments," Brankner said.
The police also found that a cheater is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated in psychiatric treatment.
The money could also end in winning devices or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is we didn't find any money with him," said the Commissioner.
A subversive who has been sentenced to theft for one year to five years now threatens to remain in prison.
So far, the police have not told us that the punishment is also a threat to the barbers who bought the notebooks at the price and sold them.
"It is true that they have taken over entirely new goods, which is minimally suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the owners of the pool have been accused so far.
Come on, another bit, you can handle it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague.
This year, our directors have made several changes.
The biggest was the change in the route, which led to the goal of the navigable, instead of leading it back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of Rungo.cz team, but I was going to spend it a little bit on the other side.
With the entire team, we decided to personally treat our readers at the station, where we took pictures and videos together.
To reach my view on the other hand, I took the role of a personal guide.
Together with a friend of Kātā, we were able to get close to the end of the corridor between 60 and 70 minutes before the start.
We greeted friends who passed us into the faster-run sector.
There's not much time left.
A few jumps on the heating, turn on the sports testers, recalculation and start!
Chest screams, but instead of a quick start, the bath was followed by the start line.
After five minutes, we come to the gate, we close the measurements, and we run at ten o'clock.
We run with the yellow hat of runners who, like Kata, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly falling sun on the sky gives a view of the Vyšehrad almost to the hump.
It looks like the whole Praha is running here.
On the coast between the Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it traditionally begins to show who has the strength.
A light pile at the Palaque Square forces many runners to slow down or move on.
Right before I go to the divadelní I see a police escort, and right after him, Vitek Pavlista is flying at an incredible pace to the goal.
I hear the amazing breath of the rest of the runners.
I move to the edge of the street, I encourage him, he's going to cry with me, but right before that, he's gonna stab my feet and our hands are just fine.
The Divadel Street runs gives you a chance to take a short break and a break.
There's a need, there's places in front of us where I can see my breath.
The island on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in the beauty of the falling sun.
I'm not breathing and my legs are almost alone.
For the first time in the ministry, there is a moment of truth.
At the crossing of the Kata road, he scurries about the rudder and conducts a jump of the sail.
I see if she doesn't need help, and I'm dropping a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
We wake up and continue the Kozí street, it's one of the southernmost places of the street, at this stage of the race, although there's no such thing here, but it's a good thing to watch around.
I still don't know that the concept of a southern place will gain its true meaning later.
Behind the Prašna gate, tourists and friends of other runners encourage us.
I'm trying to get rid of anyone who can offer a hand, and I'm recommending it to Kata, because ten punches with fans are like half an energy stick.
It's actually working, we're speeding up again, and though we've fallen down a lot, now we're starting a racing ride.
We're running through dozens of runners, when I'm putting someone in particular tired, I'm trying to encourage him with a few words, "Come on, you're gonna get it!"
No one's ahead of us anymore, we're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the goal will hurt, but you really need to make it.
The sun has fallen slowly, and the final day is symbolically slow to end the race.
The last exit to the bridge, the turn and now just the equation to the target.
The pace we're running, I'm surprised where the girl's taking it?
"Come on, let's go under thirteen hours, let's go!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target here.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Right after the goal of the cat's legs, I'm helping her to a shelter where she's resting for a while.
She's got to see the exhausting, but also good luck with a well done performance.
After a while, I'll take her out of the target space.
Euphoria doesn't make us think of the pressure in the passageway.
Here's to see that Koz's street wasn't the narrowest place.
That's what's going on here is for a ride that's under the pressure of nearly ten thousand runners to break.
If someone doesn't like gifts, it's not a place for him.
And after a while I lose my mind and think about whether the beautiful views and contrasts of the past years have become more interesting than what's going on in the target.
From my experience, I know that the competition is not fun.
If ten thousand people are added to this, the rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire centre of Prague for all transport is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere released in the Yellow Baths was transferred between the race and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random spectators staged it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, in the course of the city's historic centre, it must be counted with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is on one side bordered wall and on the other, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race has ended with a running goal, I value it as a very successful one.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but eventually everything went well.
Write to us in the discussion if you also liked the route and what you're saying about the situation in the target.
Prisoners in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria attended the international protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their requirement to re-establish the original working conditions, which had recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the temporary Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov, is also higher.
The overseers of the month symbolically protested against the new working time and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the committees of the prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, informed the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The negotiations are still underway," said BNR Director General of the Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The members of the Federation of Professional Organisations of Employees in the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of staff members of the prison service staff.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
The physics usually doesn't write bestsellers, but Brian Green from the University of Colombia managed a trial in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible route for times to penetrate into the home of problems that many of the theoretical physicists deal with today - trying to unite two great functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the elegant universe is that in the search for a unified physical theory, there is no boring story.
The basic physical problem between two key theories (for at this point our universe is de facto divided into two different worlds with different laws) solved and solved the idea that it is worth retelling and timing.
Greene also advised so much fresh material that he could not count how interesting he had not included in his book.
In addition, he made his "error" from most of the books: Structure of the universe and Hidden Reality.
The author would probably not object to anything if his book was getting older faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant universe still provides almost everything that the informed time with an ambitious understanding of the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the next few years, there will be something more alive in this area (needed to be that the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas") and so it is a good time to enter Green's unviolably open doors of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound silly, fantastic, strange or mystic.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand it, let us for a moment turn our vision from the universe as a whole to something lower, specifically to the long and thin garden radiator on the drain.
Imagine that you pull a hundred meters of garden ladders from one side of the canyon to the other and follow the entire scenario from half a mile away (as on the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice the length in the horizontal direction of the hose, but if you just don't have the bristles, you'll recognize the weight of the hose.
In view of your great distance from the hadis, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hadis has only one dimension in which you can pass: the left-right dimension along the hadis.
If someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, you will answer only one question: the distance of an ant from the left (or right) end of the ant.
All we want to say is that from a distance of half a kilometre, it looks like a long piece of hadicle as a unidimensional object.
In the real world, he's got a bunch of sharks.
If we increase everything, we will suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle surrounding the hedge.
In this enlarged view, it is obvious that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hadis, but also in "the dimension in/in the direction of movement of the clock handles", i.e. around the circumference of the hadis.
You start to understand that in order to determine the location of the little ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far is it from the end of the hash and where it is on the circle of the hash.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hadice is two-dimensional (recognised by the experts) that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of strings.
Chapters 12 and 13 shall be examined in the light of the inseparable aspects).
The surface of the hadice is bidimensional: one long distance dimension is illustrated by a direct arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circle, marked by a circular arrow, is short and sintered.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size of the side of the hedge is long and easily visible.
The size of the surrounding hadice is short, "swine" and worse known.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the sharks with a much better resolution.
This example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
That they're divided into two groups.
They can be big, dilated, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary small, piggy and much more observable.
Of course, in that case, we did not prejudge ourselves to reveal the "swine" dimension of the rolling mass of the hadis.
It was enough to take a long-range help.
But if the hats were thinner - like hair or capillary - we would have discovered the pig's size with only a great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he gave a thrilling thought that the space geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Kaluza's radical claim was justified by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be vetaked into a single, unified concept structure.
Immediately there is a question of how this Kaluz's look goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly predicted between the lines and which he clearly stated and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls on the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe may have both large and gray dimensions.
This means that, just like the dimension in the length of the hadis, our universe has a large, wide, and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we realize every moment.
But analogously with the circular circle of the garden has the space and additional dimensions, which are so deep in space that even before our most perfect experimental devices have remained hidden.
To get a clearer idea of the basis of Kaluz's remarkable proposal, let's stay a little longer behind the scenes.
Imagine that we're drawing a black rather dense series of circles on the hedge circle.
Apparently, it still looks like a thin uniform line.
With far-sightedness now, thanks to the drawing, we're going to discover the pig's dimension, and we're going to see the motive of picture 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hat is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large space dimensions, then four space dimensions together.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little bit, note the illustration of oz.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circle dimension.
In the picture, we're expanding the view of the geometry of the space just as we've expanded the surface of the hadis.
Each level below represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (see them at the fourth level of enlargement), if they are wired into enough small space; this explains that we have not seen them before.
The fourth network depicts a commonly known "great" dimension, while the circle is a new, small and porous dimension.
Just like the loops in a densely wrapped cube, these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - we just graphed them for opinion only to the averages on the Thursday network.
The background of picture 4 illustrates the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in ordinary sizes such as the meters shown by the side of the small square in the square network.
On each of the following images, we focus on a small area of the previous image; we increase it so that it becomes visible.
At first, there's nothing special about it, as we see on a few first-level increases.
However, if we look at our path behind the microscopic properties of the geometry of the space further - at the fourth level of the enlargement in image 3 - we will suddenly see a new, shape of a gray-shaped circle, similar to the skeletal or thick piece of copper.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circle dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions as well as has had a circle circumference at each point of its length.
In the interest of opinion, we have drawn a circular dimension only in some regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 The representation of Kaluz and Klein on the microscopic structure of the geometry of the space is summarised.
The similarity to hadicia is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), where the hadice has only one large dimension.
Even more important is that we're now talking about space geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, or our hickeys.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circle circle haddice - much more difficult than observing the apparent, large and wide dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed beyond the strength of our most modern enlargement tools.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not just a covered backbone within normal dimensions, as double-dimensional illustration erroneously indicates.
The circle dimension is a new dimension, which exists in each point of three ordinary longitudinal dimensions.
It is the size of the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions of the top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and back) each other.
A enough small ant could move in all four dimensions and in order to determine its position, we would need four data besides three other common positions in the circle dimension; if we count time, then the data five, in each case, about one more than we would normally expect.

The price for e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, then, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, it shows Kaluzov and Klein's view that this does not exclude the existence of additional pig sizes if they are small enough.
The universe can have a calmer dimension than we can see with a single eye.
How little should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can identify the structures of a large billion billion meters.
Less porous dimension we can barely see.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with several ideas from just parenting quantum mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that the additional circle dimension could have a size of about one Planc's length, that is, size far away for the different capabilities of today's devices.
Since then, physicists have been calling the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohnut Honza Homola advises how to practice electric guitar: 5th part
The whole substance of the "double" consists of a twelve-acting harmonic form, which you can freely repeat.
Whoever falls into the music theory finds its principle explained here in detail.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By training a basketball player and a basketball player whose facebook profile can be monitored here, he has lived as a chart since he was 20 years old.
He's a guitarist of the Wahnout band, from which unfortunately he can't leave.
The guitarist is after his father, just like his brother Matthew, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one line.
"The rhythmic model is only for you, you can think of anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model twelve," says Honza.
If you add another line, you can swap the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be done with twelve harmony on two lines to think about and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you pick up the third line, you can already pop some songs with the tunes.
When you finally add the fourth, attention to the change of the ship, the Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonium and try to put it together with the twelve.
Then practice it properly.
Best of all, you can read this in the conversation with Jan Homolo at his first school lesson on the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for the great celebration, it's for the castle of the Palace.
Let's take the point, and we like it.
For the first time, we had more chance, the second home," the attacker, who had been scored this time from the execution site.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but you just accompanied her with a huge sand?
In particular, I didn't notice it, even though on the second stage, where domestic fans are, it would probably be worse.
You've settled the penalty after midnight, but you've also got the goal from the penalty in just four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, we came up from the corner, and then we went to jail.
You woke up after her, and the first half of you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we've been playing well after the incassed goal until the break.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that the housewives said something about their game, they probably weren't very satisfied with it.
You just scored at the opponent's playground for the first time while you didn't even get a goal at home.
Why is it such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it depends on us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzen, that's another category.
You've been waiting for four matches, and you're not afraid that this might be the same after the last match?
Not at all, but of course we're glad we don't have to talk about waiting for the goal since the last match.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in the six matches, which is not yet for the great celebration.
Iceland - the lava flows from a mile away.
A lion flying on the surface in the area of Holuhraun near the glacier of Vatnajökull, flows through the underground tunnel from km away the crater.
It is located under the refrigerator, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This reality now concerns the most...
The situation remains unchanging for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.)
2014) still flies out of the hatchle about the same amount of lava.
In contrast to the original estimates, however, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
On the contrary, the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
However, scientists are afraid that the lion's tunnel could open even in places where it's under the ice.
If that were to happen, in addition to the similar intensity of the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökuls at Fjöll and on the other rivers.
Around the eruption is a strong smell of cheese, the clouds of steam and gases rise out of the crack.
It is certainly not suitable for tourism movements, as was the case in the case of the eruption at Fimvardzhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and is also much more gas," says Vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, and in the early hours, it has been in the area of almost no wind.
The feet after the sandstorm were washed with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air operations, the orange level (second highest) is applicable for Bardardbung and the yellow (third) for Aska.
The sky above Chebe was the brave Lady Peggy.
She went by the wings.
A summer day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine, Peggy Valentine's acrobat was introduced, which in summer came out from the cockpit to the back of the upper wing of the double wing as well as between the wings.
It's only transferred to the muscle force.
A summer day in Cheb was already on fire this year, and the organizers were able to prepare a few interesting flight pieces again.
The prime minister at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking by the wings" in the administration of the German acrobatic Peggy Valentine, but also the legendary winner P-51 D Mustang or the Beechcraft 18th.
The man paid attention to his bright breath.
Acrobat called Wingwalking is the origin of the United States.
After World War I, this was how many former war pilots were trying to outrun.
But he was banned for a large number of deadly attacks.
But today he's slowly coming back to the flight schedule.
Peggy's gonna get out of the cockpit on the top wing after the start.
There's a variety of exercises.
At the end of the show, they move to space between the wings of the airport, where her show continues," Luděk Matějæček of the Czech Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day described.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband, Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main grave of the program, then the next performance of Mustang's contest was the famous shaker on the cake.
The legendary winner came to the ground with the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in the envelope (so-called numbers).
Such an arrangement could be seen by air fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then presented the breath of the acrobulation with a plane from 1945.
He was still made for war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was listed in military reserves.
Since 1963 he has been active in civil matters.
And like a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich City.
In the same place is also another beechcraft C45H Expeditor of the Czech Air Day, two-engine Beechcraft C45H.
He didn't go to the airport to check on the machine.
His depleted clay floor went deep into the distance.
He also won the Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colors of French aviation.
A small passenger plane jumped for the rejected Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation to the airport on the day of the flight from the German Hof.
Germany's neighbours in Cheb were introduced to reconstructed aircraft as 18T or as a triangular formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
The family care exchanged Lucie Borgy for the workers for at least tonight.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde moderator knows nothing about it.
What a good thing it was for her to keep up with her for two months!
It's only two weeks before the blondes finished the six-weeks in which women experience the greatest stress after birth.
Lucie, however, will still not show up regularly in the main news release TV Nova.
Regular return is expected according to information from Blesk.cz up to a month.
But only her daughter Linda now needs more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a black hole.
Showcases for a year in Prague?
Hala's gonna be sold out, she's planning a wedding for Jagr.
It would be honorable if something like this happened during the world's championship.
But it matters how the bond is made," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Race, in which he again met a fascinating Nagan team.
And the players who took part in the gold hat.
The players would like to, wouldn't they?
Sure.
It would be very good to make a farewell to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they're allowed to find one two days during the tournament when it's complete free and where such a game could be mixed up.
Let's say it to Gum (Jiřim Šlégrovi) or to Bédje Škerban (the leader of the Yugoslav War), who would take care of it...
The arena would be sold out.
What if you're playing with New Jersey play-off?
So, if I fly like that...
You don't want to play in the representation.
Or did the July meeting change your decision?
Representations and exhibits are two different things and there are decisive performances in the representation.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially to the world's championship.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed in any way.
How did you actually enjoy the Naganic search?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
A man has lived up to his stories and has had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans but also for us hockey players.
Of course, the most important thing was Ivan Hlink's respect.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that there's a generation that really stood for it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Rožička and Petr Chechmánek for the midwife.
You still have your first performance game on your own?
She doesn't forget about things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Holík, and Robert Reichel, we were in one three.
For all of them, it was the first performance start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, that's not to say.
In Jihlava for a long time, Dominik Hasek was captured.
What did you say about his performance?
Hasan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hasek criticised Jagra for the reasons he decided to end up in the representation).
And the Hnilikka had a great performance.
Then you were gonna train with me once in the night, and there was a hole.
And now he's caught famous.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, football players are getting qualified.
At the NH Hotel, prominent guests took their seats on Monday morning.
People could appreciate Peter Chech of Chelsea, the representative coach Paul Vrbu...
And over there, the character in the black shirt, it's Tomáš Rosický!
The hostage Arsenal and the captain of the representation arrived at the crash about a dozen in the last.
A beautiful match against the Netherlands awaits us.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said when he was already in the representative's office in front of the press.
Czech Representation Programme
Monday 1 September: start of strike, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Year)
Tuesday September 9th Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Year) end of strike
Russian and sex fans can support even before the U.S. middle battle (20:15).
The representation opened for them a Tuesday training course, which started at the Summer at 18:30.
And then he's gonna follow an autograph that Russian or Czech won't miss.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be more peaceful.
Which is to be commended by coach Vrba, who was complaining about a lot of social activities in the spring.
Finally, we will dedicate ourselves to what we want to dedicate ourselves to.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage if you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to train things that have not yet been so long," praised Vorba, who has been leading the national team officially since January.
The Czech football team will carry out a Musketeer's image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The representation has three matches behind it, all ready.
With Norway and Finland she resigned 2:2 and with Austria losing 1:2.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's it now.
In contrast, the Netherlands is launching qualifications for the 2016 European Championships.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if the General was able to fight the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now there are important results.
We need to think about being successful," Vrba said.
The only player of a three-twentieth term that has health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
He's suffering from fever.
If he couldn't heal himself in the U.S. middle fight, Coach Vrba would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how after a bad diagnosis for many years she thought she was going to die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking she was only a few years away.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the pancreas.
The CMT-charitative organization in the UK has stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because it knows very little about the disease.
It is estimated that in the United Kingdom, CMT is suffering from approximately 23,000 people, which may show motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insomnia and fingernails.
In the case of the affected, intolerance or pain may also occur, and this condition is untreated and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When it was Rodgers' thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Frederice's ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very bad forecast.
She believed that before she celebrated the eighteenth birthday, she would be supported by a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things.
I fell down every day and it took me a long time.
I've never been able to ride with other kids on skateboards or skateboards, and at school I was shocked by how I walked and ran."
When it was Rodgers' thirteen and it was after a few operations that were supposed to release her Achilles' tears and straighten her feet, she used her doctor to leave the room, and looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was following, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I returned home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he said.
When they answered, I was in shock, and I panicked.
I thought before I was eighteen, I would end up on my truck, and before I was fifty, I'd be dead, and in the meantime I'd lose all my abilities.
I was on my own, and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to walk did not worsen as much as she expected, and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said: “Daughter, I don’t think you have a disease, otherwise you’d be on your way.
I think it's going to be a much less dangerous life."
After graduating several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was a lucky kid," I said.
The CMT-charitative organisation of the UK started a month of information about the CMT to alert this disease.
Entrepreneurship in the Washington area: taxes are taxed
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And also higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local tax on companies in the country with a rapid recovery of the economy increased slightly last year and the companies in Washington were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia totaled $27.6 billion in government and local deposits for fiscal year 2013, which is 3,8 % higher than $26,6 billion in 2012.
The tax burden - both public and local - increased by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third year of growth after 2009 and 2010 when the tax fell.
According to the study carried out by the professional company Ernst & Young and the political collection Center on State Taxation, public tax increased faster by 4.3% than local deductions by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from the welfare tax and 36% of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows the relatively minimum tax revenue from the company.
Researchers claim that the majority of the tax revenue growth is due to an increase in the value of the real estate to the companies, which increased the real estate tax this year after three years of growing -1 % by 3.7 %.
Although most profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems the same situation is in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, which represents an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of the real estate is not so much an increase in public and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the real estate tax represents a total of five companies' taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax is almost half of the state and local tax.
“In Maryland, it owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., government or non-profit organization that doesn’t pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income tax to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the healing market with real estate.
According to the data, revenue from the business also appears to be increasing.
Companies in this region have taxed $2.3 billion from commercial companies, which have increased from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has selected one billion dollars for corporate income tax, the largest in the region.
Although they are used in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not increase in these three places as quickly as possible.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the level of the national average of 4,3 %, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4,9 %.
Only in Virginia was an increase in tax on average, to 4.1 %.
Virginia has the lowest income tax of 6 % of all three districts (of which all have the same tax).
The tax rate of Maryland’s companies is 8,25 %, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study carried out this year by the American Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower government and local taxes and a more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a tax reduction law from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If income targets continue to be met in the coming year, the rate of income tax fixed by law could be reduced to 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study with small businesses in Washington, this is why higher public and local taxes are being paid.
Life tax deducted by small businesses as personal income tax - the structure of compensation for higher costs by price increases, according to which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% last year to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and the state-wide increase in food taxes will probably continue next year, overall revenue from sales for government and local governments will increase to 6.2% in comparison with the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington may, however, remain behind others, because lowering government expenditure is choosing its tax on the labour market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's knives
Will a new state emerge in Ukraine?
Putin called for a discussion about Novorusku.
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government units with the pro-russian rebels have been meeting since April.
He also warned European companies that, after the current regime of anti-Russia sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine, according to it, resists democratic values.
The end of the conflict, according to him, depends on Kyev, so he can't say when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
Any more sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic has had the right to disagree with parts
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is going to propose a form of further anti-Russia sanctions, decided at night to the EU summit.
The president of the Member States' meetings of Herman Van Rompuy told reporters.
According to the Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the package of sanctions are to be prepared already Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye will replace in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Union at the summit of the European Council, i.e. the so-called EU President, who is holding top-level meetings of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuye will be replaced.
In front of the European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton's Italian foreign minister Federica Mogherinová is appointed.
Italy, which will thus become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
The assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it's just not about it.
Helping an untreated and long-term patient with a life-threatening leave?
In Czech terms, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legal.
However, the statements of the doctors who spoke to LN indicate that they hear such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says a doctor about sclerosis
Czech suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of about three hundred people, 21 patients undergoing experimental treatment with stem cells in the Prague Motole.
We don't know if she's gonna make it.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a motor neurologist.
There's a CIA manuscript, they needed a war, writes Huml about shooting a MH17 flight.
The envoy for ČSSD Stanislav Huml has a clear indication of who shot a Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is obvious that "the strong sanctions that were declared in view of the shooting of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead were intentionally caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the law firm, it's also known the CIA's manuscript.
Unfulfilled promises.
Closer elections and parties offer again impossible
End of homeless on the streets, parking for every family and chain over Prague.
This is repeated before every election: the parties promise impossible.
Now, too, with the coming municipal elections, politicians are pushing ahead who wants more.
The Lidovky.cz server has chosen a non-fulfillable promise from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks broke out at Dunkerque.
Early clothing began
It was August 30th, 1944, when the Czechoslovaks' own brigade moved to France.
Her commander Alois Liška has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side finally declared this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German forces.
SOUHRN: Plzeň leads the league before the Prague "S", Liberec classified Baník
Victoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, leading to a point in front of both Prague's "S".
Changes in the table led to the defeat of glory 1:2 in Mladé Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta was remembered in the domestic league, defeating Jablonec thanks to two Lafat's attacks.
The record victory in the year was signed by Liberec, who shot Baník Ostrava 6:0.
62 thousand spectators on the volleyballs?
The Poles say yes.
The beginning of MS volleyballists in Warsaw brought a visual record.
At the football stadium under the covered roof, 62 thousand spectators were watching a smooth victory of the Serbs.
The tickets were then sold in 100 minutes.
How do you survive the return from your vacation?

Family Joan Rivers: "We hold our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing the hope that an 18-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers stated in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the rescue service, according to which she found a hearty foundation at the Yorkville Endoscope in Upper East Side, as the source said.
Doctors intend to maintain it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of its status, which remains "significant".
The reactions didn't let them wait a long time, including ineffective online support from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Realita's cross-titles
Unfortunately, there is no news that the media is crossing the reality with their headlines.
I know the headlines are "sellers" of the newspaper, but unfortunately, I also know that there are many so-called "readers", who don't read anything else.
And that's the fact that I've been really worried about lately, more pronounced is the word of shame.
This is particularly true of articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The titles "Israel attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text do you read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often during the declared period.
Then the title "Both parties broke the line."
Is the newspaper council aware that this process is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not just there)?
It hasn't even been 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, people who have survived Shaw.
When I saw a video from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the words "Jewish pig" and similar disbelief, it struck me.
Is this what the world wants to finish with what didn't happen to Hitler?
Are our journalists aware that after the Jews they were destined to eliminate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as a watchdog democracy.
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only real democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if any of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation would be eliminated and the Czech Republic removed from the world map?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
In the territory of the State of Israel, nearly 20% of the Arab population of Israel dwells.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they don't go between their own, like in Gaza, they'll answer you why would they do that?
In Israel they have work, social security and health care (I have seen in my own eyes how in the private hospital of Hadassa, which is funded from the sponsorial gifts of the Jews from all over the world, they are usually also Arab, and are obviously treated there).
Hamas is attacking his Arab brothers with his shots.
The only real help to Gaza, and this restless area, is to rescue Hamas and arm him.
And not judge Israel, either directly in the titres.
Inform about Hamas practices, his abuse of people as human shields.
Please inform us that Hamas is aimed at eliminating the state of Israel, at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please inform us that within nine years the Gaza Strip could have been this area of humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, but which is not paid by the Gaza Strip, they are even disappointed that the supply of electricity is sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas did not invest money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could penetrate suicide attackers in the territory of Israel, but the construction of homes, hospitals and schools would be much better for his Arab brothers from Gaza.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed claims Information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys for $1.04 billion (970 million US dollars) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to buy, but because it was expected to be a YouTube customer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Google for one billion was certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, who just founded Justin.tv three years ago, had been caught up in becoming a commonly used video streaming service - live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who sent online transmissions from the game - the words Business Inside “YouTube for live broadcasts”.
Interaface Twitche.
On YouTube are already popular videos "Let's play", a species where wise people (mostly older) play mystery science theatre.
The fact is that YouTube when describingTwitche comes across a lot, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch, which has not been canceled by anyone, was a disciple example of how the company in question pays for possible competition.
The argument is why the YouTube agreement did not go out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as the Amazon.
All we have at present is the statement by CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster.”
Another mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitche.
For snobs like me, who claim that sport is better than watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about it, games instead of real play just to observe.
One thing is to watch a friend over his shoulder in the morning, as the Resident Evil plays, and the other thing is to watch someone else get twenty shots into his head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of today's, most popular games are from the perspective of players, so to look at their record, without being able to control the perspective yourself, is a pretty good recipe for how to arrange a doll.
I admit that games like speed run, in which Rogeri Bannists our electronic time will complete the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not a game master or humor, his channel on Twitchi will probably not be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon use that?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is getting involved in Amazon Instant Video as elegant as it could have been on YouTube.
But Twitch has something that would like to attract every company: the horrors of young men who the firemen want.
According to director Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch "believes in the future game" and the media don't seem to be intimidating, or like - sex - spectators.
Second basic lie to creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheistic blogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Letters Are God's Word."
Added original video.
The second basic lie to creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers argue about one of many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us, Who will you believe?
The supposed word of God, or the word of man?
It's as if human research was completely useless compared to the authority they imagine has their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about God's written people.
If there really exists intelligent with the creator for some purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who added another series of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion in the final detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people get to tell stories, to falsify.
And it was people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposed sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as a people, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictation of angels, but those texts were not written by any other than mere mortals with a certain level of imagination, not angels and no gods at all.
If there really was one real God, it would be an integral part of all gods of all religions, supergalactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole space.
If the creature of such a size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only holy letter.
She would be known everywhere in the world, without ancestors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to believe it blindly because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would manifest a deep moral and wisdom far beyond any human limit.
It would have inspired every reader to unite the common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything smaller.
Only what we see instead is an exact opposite.
Instead of the only religion that leads to ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them continue to divide into more and more distinct denominations, searching for disputed truths, and in every way demanding God’s guidance, regardless of the continuing disunity and division in every direction.
Jewish Torah, Christian Gospel, Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláhov Kitab-i-Akdás, Zarathustrova Aves, Sikh Adi-Grant, Mahabharátsk Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormons, or the Book of Urantia are all regarded as "absolute truth" and "the word of one true God" and the respective believers say that the others are in luck.
The only logical explanation is that they are all on the way to a certain degree.
None of the abovementioned books have any other advantages.
None of them have any evidence and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I do not say that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologizing (obhajobs), because they contain inequalities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered to be true ones who have already been overcome.
So you can't claim to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote horrible beasts rather than ant, and many of them claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - that everyone can also contain the prophecy that was not fulfilled.
Early theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands, so they are the subject of interpretations, perceptions and views of their primitive and often preconceived political authors, explaining many of the contradictions and inequalities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more mutual comments.
We need to point out again that here we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
It's true that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not telling an eye witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five books of the "Moses" and Moses do not assign authority to any of them, because it was almost certainly not there as described in the Bible.
The experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezdraš) of several mutually impenetrable oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents have been re-filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as those who believe it.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are much younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed the teachings and ebony and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were separated and distinguished by other Bible revisions.
One of these regulations relates to the king of Ugarita, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Mossian religion, the authors of the New Law decided to laugh and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord on the Mount" changed to "Lord on the Mount" in Belzeb.
So the Bible was deliberately and subversively modified for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what became of the New Law was canonized in the fourth century B.C.E. in a series of Commission decisions in the snow in Nika.
Four gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by a simple raising of hands, as if the reality could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depends on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of the day.
What was read on the second Sunday after Pentecost in the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found out that they were drawing closer to the same Gospel accounts.
And that's how the core of the cannon developed from the edge of the original church.
So the council just accepted as an evangelium any relevant stories that circled between unconquered masses at that time.
Still, they wisely received more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to them as books that were approved.
We find records of both the apostles and the prophets among the rejected ones.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could she be so approved if God were the true author of this random machine of stories, similarities, and mourning lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not by too many enlightenments, rather by the opposite!
That's why so much of its historical and scientific content is completely wrong, whether it's about almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believe in superstitions, blood victims, ritual spells, magical objects, fire readings, astrology and five lives of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic pipe that was called blood, they would cure him from leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought the rabbits were survivors and the bats were birds and the whales were fish and drinking that they were the whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow-shaped patterns, they would give birth to smoked calves.
How could anyone say that to anyone who knows anything about genetics?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible were written in a higher form, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from a pen that was truly superior to the creature and was meant to be a literal history, then it would not contain anything of what it contains at all.
As a moral leader, he is totally flawed because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who looked at or supported cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, abuse of children, child abuse, execution, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudices against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their indecisiveness by claiming to do God’s will.
But the creationists are still ignoring this.
Some of their websites admit that if there is any truth in opposition to the Bible, then the truth must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists did not have their loving books, they would not have God.
There's one and the other in their world.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "honoring creation instead of the Creator".
But they themselves consider man's word to be the word of God and the God of himself, and they even insist that the overthrow of their supposed "holy" books somehow misleads God as such.
Never their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creativity Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could at the same time be mistaken, for it cannot separate doctrine from God.
So it is a type of modeling, where believers worship a man - made compilation, as if these books were God himself, for they think they are Jehovah’s Word.
Only God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, amended, and often deliberately changed and crossed by only the missing people.

An attacker at the Chinese school beat nine people, three of them died
A man named Čchen, according to the New China Agency, entered the building of the primary school in the morning and attacked about eleven local times.
Three of the nine people who were stabbed later died in the hospital.
Czechan later killed himself with a high jump, introduced New China with a link to the regional government.
In recent years China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where there are many married couples in accordance with government policy only one offspring.

The youngest students took the nine to their class, where the teacher and the teacher were waiting for the president's arrival.
Then he showed the kids how he had to sit alone at school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind your back, it's not waiting for you anymore, you're free people," Zeman told the children.
Then his wife handed him to the firstborn as a gift to the head.
President Milos Zeman in the first class of elementary school in Láne.
School Minister Marcel Chládek started a new school year in private sports school in Lithuania.
"This year I want to connect more Czech school with Czech sport," he approached one of the reasons why the first day of school was spent in northern Czech.
The school's leadership spoke to him at a hockey game in Lithuania a long time ago.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the start of the school year," the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started a school year in private sports school in Lithuania.
In the first class of the year, 115 thousand firstlings took place.
The primary school will take over 850 thousand children in total and over 405,000 students in secondary schools will be trained, the Ministry of Education estimates.

Apple iCloud reportedly was under hackers, our photos of celebrity were given to the public
Screenshot of the output of unique files
So far, the anonymous user on server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, alerted American server Machable.com.
Apparently, he gained an unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where the injury was recorded by users through automatic storage of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't spoken to the problem yet.
Part of the celebrity rejects images as falsified, but several of the affected images have already confessed.
Among them is actress Jennifer Lawrence, known as Katniss in the film series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winsteado, who played for example in the Death trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
The footage reportedly showed interest in American magazines, according to reports on the 4chan server, but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to the server The Next Web is very likely to be about the weakness of iCloud security.
On the GitHub server, a tool was found two days ago, which enabled the user to obtain passwords through hard force, i.e. by automatically repeating the attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was obviously working, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is true that potential attackers had a lot of time to gain access to different accounts before the publication of this instrument.
iCloud users should therefore change their password associated with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length is at least 12 characters.
The absence of naked images should be considered as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers are companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, which are securely better than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to store online explicit photos or any other sensitive content, first encrypt files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set automatic storage of photos from the phone so that it only runs on the wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
Then you will have the opportunity to move sensitive images "to safety", and you will mainly have space to erase unauthorized images, so they will not necessarily take up space in the online store.
How to encrypt files and communications on the Internet, we offer HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an electronic book from Michal Altaira Valáška in PDF format.
Smart way to save for high school script
Since the price for a high school script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the current second-year student came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of lending books from senior employees with a nominal compensation offer to keep their sales back.
"The book on calculations, which is normally worth 180 dollars, I got in the semester for ten and for chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would be $430, he says.
I lost 120.
According to the University Council, the average student loses more than $1,200 per year for textbooks and aids, but students have different opportunities to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the book semester and often with significant discounts before they buy it.
Or Inc, operating more than 250 bookstores in campus areas, says that lending books have doubled since 2011.
Research in the sector shows that around a quarter of the books in university bookstores were in the last spring semester of loans, says Vice-President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased by the National Association of University Trades in University Bookstores.
Here's 101 of the best ways to make it happen.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be as low as a third on the Internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler is nearly $290, but on the internet it is possible to buy a new $239.99 at Chegg.com, a small store specialized in the textbook.
Buy Used
If you do not mind the comments of other people or the consumption and destruction, appropriate teaching texts are used.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid at Amazon.com for the printed "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business" 42 cents.
The new guy was selling for $48.
University Teacher Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls proposes that students in their teachers check that older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes there are no major changes to the work at the seminars.
If so, the oldest editions can be sold at a price break last version.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, they are the preferred alternative for buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
Also, if you treat them well, you will not forget to return them and you will not need to have them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, the student could borrow "Calculus" for about twenty dollars throughout the semester.
List the terms and conditions of the transaction in which you borrow the book, including the contribution to notes, accentuation or consumption and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the penalty may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-mail
Another option is to look at the normal e-book instead.
Sometimes these books are basically borrowed in the form of electronic licenses valid after a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most useful offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go after the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be on Pepperdine Law School, recommends driving according to the ISBN, because it guarantees that you buy the right book.
Before ordering your book over the Internet, make sure it's really in stock, Gault advises.
He convinced himself of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
It's a bad thing, it's a bad thing.
And then they found guns in the cold tower at the end of the war.
This barn is a piece from the church of St. Jiří.
We discovered the growth around and began to pull out the flying load - about a foot and a half of the mud and the snowy leaves.
As we got close to the big day, we hit the head," said Radomil Novak.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it was a tortoise of German rifles used by SS units.
The finding is probably unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novák added.
All the wooden construction things have spread over time, so it's useless.
Her body is, of course, preserved - keeps its shape.
How's the cold light?
There's one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably from fear of being withdrawn.
The Fascists would probably not have done it.
They threw weapons in the woods," he thinks.
The gun was the only thing that the spirits of the Spirit of the Jessenics found in the cold.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were times around a lot, so we slowed down the exhumation work, we carefully explored the mud, so that there was no accident, but nothing else was down there," Novák approached.
The discovery ends in the museum depositary at the castle in the nearby Slezky Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I haven't yet been released from custody of the Czech Republic
Exclusive interview Currently.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from capture of the prosecutists.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they're calling me from Donéck," he apologized eight times during an exclusive conversation with Aktualno.cz Ukrainian lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban, or also the director of the Dark Centre for the Liberation of War prisoners.
Lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban on TV.
In any such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - that Ruban is clearing himself with his opponent at the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it -- go there," he arranged one of the flash discussions with Doneck and again dedicated himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in custody, a pilot of a fighter and an active participant in protests in Majdan.
Yesterday, when we were having a conversation, he was in Doneck.
The release of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Peruvian separatists shall be 40 hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that on the part of the prorus separatists, the Czechs are fighting.
Our reconnaissance estimates their number to thirty.
It can be much more than that, though.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've already freed the captured Serbs, Dagestians, Chechens, one Swedish, Georgians... but the Czechs haven't yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we hit your captive country and could free him.
Ukrainian soldier occupied by separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to the Czechs who join the prosecutors and Ukrainian soldiers to take care of them?
They should understand that if the Czechs fight in Ukraine's volunteer flags and the separatists take them, they will be shot without mercy, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men to be tenants, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
For example, if Ukrainian soldiers take over a group of Donkey separatists - and therefore the Czechs - then they will put him on the net and deal with him as a prisoner of war.
That guy's gonna survive soon.
The Ukrainian side is also in war as a state.
A.cz: How many of you have managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand that well, they'll swap it.
Some sources indicate that hundreds of men have already crossed the line.
We've long stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we've just freed them... we haven't saved them from war if they decide to continue in fear.
The rescuers are doctors, surgeons, but we definitely don't.
That's it.
And every day there's another and another.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to let the prisoners go, and it's just a human request.
A.cz: It is said that in a few months, you have gained great authority and even trust in the Persian separatists... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both sides of the war?
It's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kyiv gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe that's the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Church, I've had some authority before.
I never run, I never cheat, I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it's the Ukrainian government, or the ham or luhansk very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're gonna torture and kill them.
And they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I'm being replaced by prisoners and caught... this work for me can always mean the end... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many corrections and tortures do you know?
... (long note) To torture prisoners, Ukrainians and separatists shall be deprived of hearings.
I'm sorry.
What about the repairs?
You're only playing on the side of the screen.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also repairing the prisoners, I have no information.
Not even the signs that the Ukrainian army will allow for something like that.
We have an idea about the amount of corrections, but I can't give you the numbers and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the Peruvian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They seek independence and perhaps democracy in Doneck or Luhansk - at least they say so.
They don't want to play any more games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists already have the oligars full of teeth and are their insatiable resistance to life and death.
As we say, they've moved to the back.
The same dreams and charges were given to people by the wayside in Maydan as well.
And now I'm kind of wondering: Russia supports separatists and the West instead the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be a big one and the other as a small one.
Now, this is my sentence, but it's hiding in itself an inexcusable dispute.
A.cz: For example, how do you see one of the strongest leaders of the Peruvian separatists Igor Besler?
Whenever I cross the line of war fronts, I'm without weapons, and I show soldiers or armed men unarmed with their bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of these two hundred or three hundred meters on a man or in an optical focuser.
The faces of people who look at me, I always see well... and they can always push the trigger of their weapons.
Exhibitor, experienced Colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small government in a great Russian empire.
In any case, he constantly talks about it, and Ukraine considers any misunderstandings.
He said that such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an unrelenting enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we're talking about the characters - in the Ukrainian debate show, your Prime Minister Arsenija Jacenjuka has identified you as a weak, unhappy and tired "leader", who would do the best if he left quickly.
I'll always get at least five fears in the three hundred meters.
So why should I hide my opinion that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is damaging our country?
A.cz: Do you think it's part of the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians are calling the "King."
And the king is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal from which fear or respect and authority go.
His behavior directly duplicates the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister in war he has no right to cry in parliament, ask him to play with him his intrigues, to threaten that positions of function... he has to run the country, manage it and in time of war and protect it.
When threatened by the country, the prime minister has no claim for family, friends, rest for payable emotions.
He's the first of Ukraine's ministers.
And Jacqueline?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yeah, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the markets
Extraordinary 3 Sylvester Stallone returned from the $190 million budget in the United States less than $30 million and Sin City: Women for whom I would have been murdered, I would have returned from the $12 million budget.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz during the first weekend made only $14.6 million and also movies for children like How to Train Dragon 2 were for film disappointment.
According to Robbie Collin's film critic in Telegraph, children's films are of their own quality.
Collin marked the year 2014 as “the worst” year of children’s films and how to train dragon 2 called only “functional” continuation.
When it comes to films aimed at a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, the Entertainment Weekly servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average rating of annual film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas in the period between the War Victims Day and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results taken into account by viewers and film critics indicate that this year's film crop is similar to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, there may be a change in the attitude of viewers and a higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s jungle book processing, said the Hollywood Reporter website, “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's already happened.
Unlike the current crisis in the Hollywood casino markets, Netflix has won $1.2 billion thanks to Internet services, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the study because they relied too much on the rights of comics, and predicted the "degradation" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators say that there may be something on his catastrophic knowledge.
With the introduction of possible large cash markets in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultran, Minimons and Jursk world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
Producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked a decrease in markets for simple "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter he said: "The next summer will be the summer of the biggest casino markets in history and no one will worry about selling."
KLDR again threatens Soul, fires another short-run missile
North Korea fired another short-run rocket into the sea, Sul announced.
The alleged rocket test was carried out shortly after the end of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjongang sees as a preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang lies on the northwest of KDLR at borders with China.
According to the DPA, the Yugoslav Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated that the shots were fired from the site in the north-west of the KLDR and flew about 200 kilometres away.
So North Korea was probably the first to fire a rocket from the province of Chagang, a South Korean media with a call for military rounds.
In the province there is a subterranean fire-fighting ramp for Scud-type rockets.
This is another series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks.
This year, North Korea has carried out an unusually large number of rocket and artillery tests.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests were held against NATO's Newport summit.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at the center of Newport to attend the march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the council in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as an anti-assuming.
Stephen Fairclough was watching the weekend situation and talking to protestants who arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be transported by air from the Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by the plane and transported safely after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girl and eighteen-year-old man took a tour to Govetts Leap in Blackheat on Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, the family's anxiety called about eight o'clock the night of the police.
She was sent to a patrol station, including the local police and the rescue team, and a couple of eleven hours were found near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl fell on her knee, and the man fell down, and then fell in the head.
The cops stayed with them overnight, and they were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, the ambulance was transferred to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only the point from Opava, the victory had on his leg Vasiček
The 23-year-old forvard could decide, but he failed in two of the biggest chances.
After the round, she called mainly about three minutes before the end, but ended up on the market of Opava Joseph Květonova.
I had it on my feet, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," cried Vasiček on his head.
"I think I should have put it up under the veil, it was a little bit gone," he said.
The defensive Sigmy of the Pope did not allow too much, except that Mikul's 11-minute drive, which covered the Golman Reichl.
Then they started pushing the Hanáci, but they didn't let the defenses go in the block, and they shot off the far side caught the Flower.
We compared fifteen minutes, and then we took the initiative.
In the second half, we were better, we had more games, and Ava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the chance that was presented did not change Vashček, so it ended at 0:0," hated coach Hanák Leoše Kalvod.
The trouble was also taken for absences in a facility where, apart from the two wounded, Petr Vavřík was missing with the three-point shooter Petr Ševčík, who are hosting in Slezska from Sigma.
It was not possible for them, unlike their previous policy.
The replacements deserve an absolute.
Sigma acted more football, but we did not leave her to anything on one standard," said Slezanów coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and fighting.
Remiza is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got a remix on four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of Joseph Lebra Club, who, after defeating Znojm, made his millions contribution to the diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebra's warning, so it can't be said that the boys would not want to fight," Calvoda noted and added to the address of the sleeping shooter, "I believe it will come and when it hits the target, it will start to fall there.
But after the first blow, I'll get him to run the balls for another fight," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino hit Benátky twice.
Film Festival otherwise survives the crisis
After a great enthusiasm for Birdman’s opening film, whose director Alejandro González Iñárritus arranged the race among the serious candidates in the Golden Lion, the next days gave evidence that the interest of the 71st annual festival in Benátka was somewhat waned.
Whether it was because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen, or because Birdman was followed by criticisms recognized, but for viewers less attractive images as a document of genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s With a look of silence and other films with a social theme from the American 99 homes after the Iranian story, there were short seats in the cinemas.
Comics of the species Gallus domesticus
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet covered such gifts as in the past, and it seems to have stopped being the problem of finding a place in the hotel at the last minute.
The crisis in Italy is spoken of more than anywhere else, and it is not surprising that it has reached as many institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Unfortunately, the crisis does not show a lack of personality, but present especially in relation to films.
While younger fans yearned for the autographs of comic superheroes by Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations there was no difference.
He's locked up in two movies right now.
In the story of the Review mentioned outside the competition, which filmed Oscar Barry Levison according to the novel Philip Roth, has a 40-year-old Pacino's role, which is close to him: actors at the top of the fame, who suffer from depressions from the end of their career and personal life.
But seeing him the second day as a strange owner of railways from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, which David Gordon Green made, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best artistic performance should not miss it - but does the artist still have Pacin's format needs prices?
Perhaps the greatest satisfying love of the public is for him, and especially for Italy, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his cousins come.
Body for Italy
Mostly just Italian film is running very well in Venice this year.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman's first image with a long-lasting portrait.
The Mafia Calabrian ratio is viewed in it as a family relationship between clans that fight for power and money, and the director was able to match all the assumptions for a good movie: a quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
He also took the chamber psychothriller Cold Heart, who staged Saverio Costanza with Albou Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost loses her own child.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not welcome the warm acceptance of neither the Compulsory for Glory nor the 3 Hearts, both of which are embellishing on the traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of the actors.
But in the end, two really great movies, Birdman and Black Soul, aren't so little at the first half of the festival.
And although the festival images have all the depressive themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new image called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy mentioned in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American cheerleaders 40 years old, has succeeded in raising the mood for more than one day.
Police arrested four pervitin producers in Prague, vehicles from Poland
"The detectives detained three men in the last days at the age of 42, 42 and 37 and a five-year-old woman who produced and sold pervitin drugs in Prague from November to August," said police spokesman Jana Rössler.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, an intervention unit in the Cillářska Street caught a 40-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who represented in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer.
The following day, the detectives were detained on the basis of the prior consent of the national representative of the next member of the group, a man of seventy years.
The last of the four police officers arrived in the middle of the morning hours of August 20th in the Malèske Burnovna area," the speaker described.
For the transport of drugs from Poland, a third woman received drugs
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
In the airport area, in the garden home in Horomeřice, in the apartment in Konevova street and in other places in Prague, he produced pervitin, supplied various aids and chemicals necessary for its production and provided the transport of medicines with pseudoefedrin from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the manufactured drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold pervitin.
The transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs helped him for five and a half years, a woman who had not yet been punished.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs manufactured," Rössler added.
On the basis of the judge's order, the criminals also carried out a number of domestic visits, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, injection syringes, hadics and other aids and objects that can be considered by expertise as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"Then, from the records available, the policemen found that the main organizer had been tried seven times since 1995 for property criminal activity, a woman who had not been tried," the police spokesman added.
The latter was detained in 2006 on condition as a criminal offence of sexual abuse and the seven-year-old car mechanic who has been released has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
And with him, it was mostly a criminal act of property.
The investigator accused three men and women of committing a criminal offence of unlawful manufacture and other handling of mindless and psychotropic substances and poisons, which threatens them up to decades of imprisonment.
Finally, three persons were asked by the investigator to invite the State representative to submit a proposal for the release of the link where the judge finally placed them," the speaker said.
The fourth defendant, a seven-year-old reindeer, ended up free.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as in other defendants.
The cops are still working with this man.

Disposal of high school and high school doesn't make any sense.
Czechs have few generally educated people and statistics also show that gymnasiumists have good application.
The beginning of school year is here.
During the last 14 days, large preparations were under way in schools.
Most of these are routine matters, such as the transfer of flowering plants from the summer warehouse back to the class and the painting of the wings.
They're going to have a little more frmol in the hot gym.
A few days before the start of the season, they search for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or deception, the four-year high school in Horíčić opens and renews its activity after three years.
Not on the public, but on the private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the founders.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by a registration of schools managed by the MSMT.
"French Socialists should shut down and put France in order," says key associate Francoise Holland
Valls calls for a highly fragmented left to "show his support" to a war-fighted socialist president whose new division of functions was not met with the consent of the majority of the French.
The President deserves all respect, loyalty, our support.
"Our duty is to stay behind him," he said and bowed down.
As a peaceful gesture, the president of the government insisted that his government would not question the controversial French three-and-five-hour work week, despite the passionate advances by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who proposed at the beginning of the week to set the rules free.
On Saturday, the Socialists asked them to remain "consistent" with the government.
Christiane Taubirová, Minister of Justice, made a line through the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticised the Socialist side for her "Francouses have lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, a leader of extremely conservative rights, with unresolved internal disputes between the socialists laughed when she declared that she did not assume that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls was also forced to establish a new government when the former did not last until the end of the years.
"And the new will not last until the end of the winter or the winter," Le Pen told his supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for Parliament's dissolution and stated that she was convinced that it could win the preliminary elections and that it was ready to rule the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in March's municipal elections and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey by Journal du Dimanche, 76% of the French feel that the Socialist Party is at risk of dividing itself into several rival groups even before the end of the Dutch functional period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon have patience if the new socialist government could not improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen.
Hazard and street art no longer limits Prague to elections
Changes to the relevant notices should be prepared and approved by the new head of the city.
The street of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections, and the city will not limit street art.
There will be no limit to the wedding of dogs.
Prague shall not reach the October elections to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant declarations.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by current city management, which ends in a few weeks' time," said Councillor Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several councillors, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel a flat-rate accident in their territory.
But the hero doesn't disappear, the gambling statement won't change until now.
It's the task of new city leadership after election.
Now we would not technically achieve this, for example, in terms of time to comment, and so on," Manhattan explained.
He added that the last session of the current representative, which must be approved by the amendment of the notice, will take place on 11 September.
The referendum on the flat ban on gambling will take place on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
At present, a gambling ban applies, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The statement will not change for the same reasons, even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, he complains about Prague 1, which has already sent the magistrate a proposal for a place that he would like to extend to the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians also don't want Prague 5 around Angela.
The city's wedding announcement is going on for several months, so far it's not finished.
The location of the game and the problem of the busking solves the city's announcements.
It can only be issued or amended by the representative of the capital.
Counsellors have only a advisory vote, they don't have to issue a statement on their own.
Last week he put the victory to the Scottish independence proponents on the reach of the hand
The campaign for Scotland's independence was in danger of making this mistake the second time, when it almost put on billboards throughout Scotland the question of whether Scotland wants to be rich.
But you will not get to the heart of the Scottish volunteers by appealing to their wallets, nor will you gain their respect when you start threatening them.
The morale of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, even though only a few Scottishs still go to church today.
Scotts have a far greater tendency to avoid changers from the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The head of the Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and that's why he repeatedly questioned his rival, Unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scottish people", if the Scottish voters voted for independence, and begin to support the single currency for Scotland and England.
It made Darling choose between the Scottish civil society and the London financiers, and he fell into this trap with thunder.
Of course, Darling won't be able to command the Scottish will.
However, the debate on what Scotland will have the currency has already been more neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish voters is fairness, employment opportunities and the defence of public health, which are free of charge.
Darling supported the London banker in the matter of money and also raised the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of health care.
The way Salmon said it, he went into bed with the conservatives.
This is a very dangerous situation for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish volunteer knows that the Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with a conservative.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland, not to the volunteers, but to the association of the "boss", to the Confederation of the British industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmonella was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a missing housekeeper.
The Scottish would respect him if he came to debate with the Scottish prime minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland could be "a successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost a physical pain.
What he's saying is clear: Scotts don't jump and have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Milos Urban
Illustration to story Longest year
Dear Urban Longest Year
The end of the holiday was the best, the last week that's gone nowhere, and we've just been humming around with Grandma's summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, when it came from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
The reading of the Fast Arrows, already pedestaled, the glazing on the hill around the Imperial to the back behind the Vary, some to tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun was colding the back and shoulder, stuck the paprus on the divorced.
Tonight's a little nervousness, still a holiday regimen, sleeping until 11 a.m., it'll be worse in a week, just before bedtime, they'll take a couple minutes to two hours, then get up in the morning at 7:00.
It'll be Monday.
Most people don't, on the contrary, in the summer, they're being sexually abused in front of school.
Applicable to use in a flashlight on a plate and to look like a plastic sticker in a glass bed, there's the school, ZDŠ A.
The backdrop with a filthy pink cover, and before it the old familiar faces and a few new, the boys more distant, the girls more peach.
There are predators, those who avoid it, it's just as interesting how they keep together and how soon they're here.
And these grown-up girls who came screaming now hysterically laugh at something, maybe something changed in their life during the holidays, while everything is in my old age.
And again, the new beginnings, some nerves and other joys, why are they here at all?
Because it has to be a military education obligation.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with the mop, unfortunately, still the same thing that lends the rabbit a key from the patch box, where they can leave the textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress is still in memory, now it's not good, it's pretty excited, but it's gonna get worse in a week.
It's the only way out of the picture is the stomach, and it's starting to get a headache.
A head that is even worse from math, that devilish game for the chosen, among which I don't belong, and I'll never be.
Again, the three and four, there are no five, hide before the test, get into the barn and get the best out of it, be there, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream about the stories of nicer girls and beautiful buildings, about antennas in space where no one bothers with anyone, does not humiliate anyone and does not insult anyone's feet.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
The birth daughter left her to die.
She's threatened with an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
With no help from a stranger, she was born a girl who, after she had cut the doll, hid it under the jacket and took it to the roadside trailer, where she was put into the caves several hundred meters from the road.
She gave birth to a school path
It came to me a little bit earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom on the bus, and I was born there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut through the poppy rope with the knives I carried in the school," described the defendant and said she was ashamed of the pregnancy.
"The next day she went back to the place, put the child's body in the trunk and drove it away, took the body out of the trunk, packed it into a black needle bag, and hid it and left her grandmother at home in Havlík's Broda," the complaint is that it is not quite obvious when the birth of a newborn came to an end.
It could have been ten minutes, but also several hours after birth, breathing when covered with blankets or when putting under the blanket, cooling or bleeding from the unbounded doll.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in the spring.
A woman in the near undetected period from February to April 12 when a child was found by a dead child by random witnesses under the cross at a fish farm in Havlíčkobrodska, gave herself a secret birth.
This time in the bathroom of the basement apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether she was born alive, without cutting off, and wearing a doll that was wrapped around her neck, she put the child into several plastic bags, including the igelite bags, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon hours, he and his partner took him to the fishermen.
She was finally met by a friend.
The father of both children was just a friend of the accused, who apparently didn't know about the pregnancy partners.
Even for this reason he is not now before the court, only being punished for a violation of the funeral law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him being punished as a partner.
He manipulated the child against my will.
I know that my solution was not right, but it came to me at the time as a human," did not cover up the complaint, which apparently was in relation to a man and feared him.
During her statement, a young woman spoke fairly.
The tears he shed in her eyes until the moment she spoke about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after she reached adulthood.
She didn't want to kill.
"They follow me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she exclaimed.
I didn't use my equipment because I didn't want the kids, I looked young.
I wanted to put him in a baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain that to you," she answered the judge.
She refused, however, to act with the mind and intention of killing a newborn.
According to her claim, the second child was born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I've narrowed it down.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also restricted smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, all of her repeated questions claimed that she had a health problem that she was pregnant.
And that's a friend.
The main judgment will continue in the Court of Justice on Tuesday's statements by the judges.
On Wednesday, a sentence could already be issued.
A woman is threatened with a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison, possibly an exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is close to the three-billion-dollar purchase of Prestige Cruise
According to the sources known to the whole issue, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the third largest operator of shipping ships around the world, in the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc., about three billion dollars.
The Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, which competes with higher competition Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has made it possible to access luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and rich customers.
The Agreement may be published this week, it has produced a source on Sunday, but it has pointed out that the negotiations still do not have to be successful.
Owner Prestige Cruises, private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
The resources were not to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, speaker Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise is based in Miami operating thirteen cruise ships on the North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight passenger ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced markets of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that in the coming year, the 90 billion segment of travel will benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India.
Companies are competing for these customers to become the preferred option for the selection of cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since 2007 since the closing of the trade of $850 million.
The Norwegian Cruise has been in its current form since 2000, when it has come to contact the shipping operator of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of companies engaged in leisure and casino spending time, which is controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
In 2008, Apollo to Norwegian Cruise invested one billion dollars.
Norwegian Cruise launched a stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration by the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a share of 28 %, Apollo 20 % and private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to registration records, the first public offers include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises as well as 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong challenge the Chinese authorities on the day after the vote decision
Nearly a group of loyal people to Beijing, who had a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress agreed on Sunday that only two of the three candidates were elected in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the nomination committee, which is likely to consist of members of the faithful Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democracies to get to the polls and persuade pro-democratic activists to renew their promises and protect Hong Kong's financial centre of protests by the "Employment of the Central" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on the Chinese official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered the city's trading district and occupied it.
The press conference, attended by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several press conferences were also scheduled to be held by the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Committee of the Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
Student activists declared that they were meeting in front of Hong Kong's government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kyev to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of the events in the Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop the struggles of the separatists in the country's east and to start immediately negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the secluded areas.
His spokesman Dmitrij Peskov later explained that Putin did not intend to point out that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian speaking area would have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's challenge to the Kyiv government to deal with the pro-russian uprisings as equals, is in line with a clear strategy, according to which it is directed from the outbreak of five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and make the Ukrainian government give the newly declared Novorusk a real independence so that it can connect the place to the West with Russia.
In the conversation for the first channel of State television Putin condemned Ukrainian military action, which is to reclaim the eastern areas of Doneneck and Luhansk, which ruled the separatists in March and April after Moscow was investigating the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists of the recently occupied territories referred to as "Novorusko" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which "the prison of illusions" is everyone who believes that peace is in sight, because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign in front of the October 26th parliamentary elections, while government units attack civilian populations in the areas of separatist control.
"In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately initiate meaningful negotiations and not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the statute of state sovereignty of the South Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's interference with state sovereignty was thought of in the context of a broader autonomy that Kyjeva's leadership has been conducting for several months and which is intended to mitigate the concerns of Russian speaking areas from the threat of cultural and language rights.
Peskov stated that the necessary autonomy can only be granted to the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The progress of spokesperson Kreml, who was supposed to correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's notes, stressed the Russian leadership's approach to resolving the rise of the separatists in the east, which is different from the open siege of Crimea, where most of the two million people are from ethnic Russians.
Moscow should have much more difficulty investigating both Donéck and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, as the majority of 6.5 million people are not Russians and public opinion polls, which have been carried out even before the conflict, have shown widespread support for the repression in Ukraine.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats acting on international forums would give the regional government in Ukraine the power to determine its own trade agreements and international relations, thus giving Kremlin a real control over the territory that would connect the Russian fortress with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, located five months ago, is the home of the main Russian maritime fleet, the maritime commercial background and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also centrally down, factory and sleigh, which make important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko, during his opening speech on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, consider changes in the constitution that would give various regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs significantly from the vision of Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of armaments and incitement of violence.
Putin's last call for Kyev to act as a separatist as she did after the next procedure of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks from the former peaceful area along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists of Russia have taken control of Novoazovske in such a way that the Ukrainian security authorities are concerned that it is aimed at occupying strategic coastal areas up to Crimea.
This accelerated the huge civil and military effort to secure Mariupol, a port with metalurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants lying between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate on the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, a report appeared at a meeting of the European Union's leading representatives in Brussels and called for an action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kyjeva on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaki after last week two columns of Russian defence vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Danube area to support armed separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers arrested in Ilovak during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian exodus arrested a week ago in the home country of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
In the scandal with the photos discovered there are also Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disappointment at the hackers who probably stole his intimate photos of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after, in the biggest scandal with hacked photos, the celebrity got on the internet a series of explicit photos of our Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims to have sixty naked photos of Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevenne, singer Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Ley Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Because of the departure from iCloud, the public reportedly also received personal photos of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked for a hand last month, said to the magazine Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information is given to steal and spread to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, reported online to the press that hacking is "unfortunate" and those who have become his target are "degrading".
It is considered that the hacker has obtained thirty photos of Palmer with an ex-Scott Speedman's friend, including two images on which he goes upstairs without breaking up at the pool.
Palmer acted, for example, in a movie of Love and honor, where her cousin Liam Hemsworth was.
Palmer, the TV star Chuck Strahovski and the actress from the thriller Sugar Punch Browning yesterday did not comment.
The representative of Lawrence TMZ said: "This is a clear breach of privacy."
Herec Seth Rogen hacker on his Twitter criticised: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigmy footballers got better, even without winning
Olomouc - Chromies and lightnings that the collaborator of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinate last week are apparently past.
Although they brought only a point for a free rebate from Opava.
By putting on and fighting the club boss, they just got a little better.
The payout money could soon come to the club.
"I'm leaving another game, as I talked about last week, but I'm far more optimistic," Lebr confirmed, despite the fact that Sigma didn't win, her players were convinced by improved performance.
The fight and the set-up we were playing with mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from players.
In such a case, I am able to forgive that he won't win.
If we were to play like this from the beginning of the season, I'm sure we haven't lost," Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial pressure on the home, then the game was balanced, and in the second half it was better.
After Kalvod’s victory, the faithful were defeated, but they did not reach their goal, and they could not win.
The result, though, is not according to our ideas.
We lacked complete satisfaction, but only one changed chance," Lebr said, but he did not think that the change in the attitude of the footballers was causing only his threat.
There must have been more aspects there.
Whether from my side, from the coach, or from the fans," Lebr said.
With pressure, Sigma has to count.
The players did not want to comment after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to let it go," the young white man Michal Reichl cut his head off.
He then left a question on Lebro's statement from last week's attacker Václav Vasiček, who did not change Sigmy's biggest opportunity in the Saturday match.
After all, he was just talking about the pressure.
We'll be under the pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to pull us out.
Today we've shown that if we fight and drive everyone in the ass, it'll go away," he said.
Warned by Hearts
Even Leoš Kalvoda’s viewer did not insist that the preparation for the match was not the easiest in view of the atmosphere she had in Olomouci last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about not wanting to fight and blow it off," the Olympic coach said.
It was like today's first fifteen minutes.
It took us a long time to compare ourselves with the toughness and realize what the other league is about.
That it's not just about football, it's mostly about fighting," Kalvoda said.
There's only hope that in the next matches, Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe it," I said.
