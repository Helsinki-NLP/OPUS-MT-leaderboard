Spectacular salt in "wingsuit" above Bogot√°
Sportsman Jonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a mix of wings), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous Saint Monserrate, located more than 3,000 metres above sea level, where many Badads gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners find it hard to find the money needed to repair self-propelled infrastructure in decrement, many are those who discuss a solution in the form of a small black box that is located above the table on the edge of your car.
Appliances, which record all thousands of cars through a car driver and transmit information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the government offices of planning to maintain the obsolete system of financing major American roads.
The sector generally lacks interest in the planning of major axes has suddenly led to a strong animated debate and moving alliances.
The liberators have joined environmentalist groups to pressure the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly of the road on which you travel, then use the information to write a bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are not able to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, in the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands of trips.
Thousands of motorists have already loaded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turn.
This is truly essential to our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, director general of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the state will start recording thousands of cars by 2025.
There's going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes paid by Americans to the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much fuel as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 cent, while fuel prices are high.
"The fuel tax is simply not tenacious," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State recently installed tractors on 500 cars to test a payment system per mile.
"This is the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wunks calls this the cost of using the kilometer.
It is not surprising that the idea is seducing the citizens' liberals, as taxes could be used to change the behavioural habits in order to reduce the coverage and emissions of gases, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious climate heating laws.
However, representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on the Transport of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
Free market participants from the Reasonon Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for the mile.
"It's not just a tax that goes into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Policy at the Reasonon Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they have been provided.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the way to the payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have carried about 10,000 cars.
But the Presidency of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of the rural legislators representing voters who have to spend many miles every day to go to work or in the city.
However, several States and large cities make progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country's most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay the State of Kilometric Costs instead of fuel taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the coast, is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a car, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their least facts and practices.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Transportation Department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, Nevada's ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-scale locator devices."
There is no need to build an enormous and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to preserve the records of people's daily trips and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few States that are moving now to find an affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or the exact time.
If we can do this, it added Khan, the citizens will be more at ease.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up of California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help car owners paying taxes to States.
She was looking for a search in the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay depending on their mileage.
But the devices it tests have a lot to schedule the big axes because they don't use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive means and far less intrusive methods to do so.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering different choices to motorists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any equipment at all, preferring the place to pay a fee based on the average number of miles per year by all residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport managers are looking to develop a charging device that would also be equipped to pay the parking charges, provide a "road payment" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid bottlenecks.
"Car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if all the debate on the payment to the mill is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could be very simply managing the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on fuel.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on other vehicles whose fuel consumption is low, so that each pays its own share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs with the Commission.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four unpublished listening
The English musician has not finished to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, released in January, he has planned a luxury redesign for 4 November, with several unpublisheds.
Four have already emerged on the Table.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left the whole world.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, date 2003) and too rare public appearances, English musician proved that it could still be relied on to spark the pop scene.
A party for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus planned to re-edit this album on 4 November.
For the occasion, he cooked a real party for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three disks: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already opened.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional songs compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially released for the occasion, as well as two replays.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces each of the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a book to share its own impressions, a book with words...
And, above all, it gives a taste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a highly controlled rock electricity.
Unpublished already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a disturbing intro before a light cavalcade that slows down gradually to leave room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, or even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddy, by the way, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes a new reference to his alienity: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, sendin', give you the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: turn to informant, man on board a rifle, martian potential...
He dissimulates and reveals both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he incarnates.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from 10 November.
The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, insisted that injured soldiers were not released from the Canadian Armed Forces in summary, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civil life.
Attacked by the Liberals and neo-democratics in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not comply with the "university of service" rule of the army demanding that staff be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including one released soldier last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reserver in Ontario, was released from the post-traumatic stress syndrome despite his request to remain a year longer in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after the case of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who stated before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not respond to the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared from time to time, with plans and consultations, but that it was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with The Canadian Press Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major struggles in Afghanistan, the army has been in a position to determine the latitude it can afford to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but who are not fit to fight.
Under the current rules, soldiers have been severely injured for up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the service period required to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesperson for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked on Wednesday to reintegrate Corporal Hawkins, while neo-democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prefer tablets to its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com website or via its application for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is scheduled only in 2014, detailing its Disney Junior Division's communication.
The animated drawing, for children 2 to 7 years of age, tells the adventures of the Callie cat, sheriff of a city of the American West where it regulates the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, vice president of Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the communiqu√©.
This type of experience comes within Disney's efforts to "extend the life span of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms", he added.
A study published early in the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the under 2 years of age had already been used with a tablet or telephone, and 72% of the under 8 years of age, respectively, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the denunciation of U.S. information services, said that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Str√∂bele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a fugitive and seeks to penalise the political speech with accusations that it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he felt that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, it is accused of espionage and theft of property of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said in Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany was severely tested as a result of complaints that the NSA had listened to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who led the parliamentary group to oversee foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance of hearing Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States", he had to take advantage of it.
Mr Str√∂bele, German MP Vert, posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
On his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str√∂bele said that according to the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden witnessed in Germany, he should be assured that he would be safe there, said the Member.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to "my political expression."
The citizens of the world, as well as the top leaders ‚Äì including the United States ‚Äì felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility.
The letter makes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the video service on demand from Netflix via their television in a future that doesn't seem so distant.
Cogeco's branch indicated Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to develop more friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained the president and head of the management of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus encumbers its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet a precise date in relation to this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and failure," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate objective remains to provide tools that our customers currently do not have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been mentioned, could be regulated.
In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussions with some major cable distributors to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable's p.-d.g. also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government at his talk on the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for the services on the map.
"It's been almost two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chains, it doesn't work," said Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco's father.
The CRTC has conducted consultations with the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that it had recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¬¢ by action.
This is a reduction compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¬¢ by action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline by the cost of depreciation related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States, for $1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal.
In December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's income, they had a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They amount to 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¬¢ by action, in decline compared to 45.7 million, or 93¬¢ by action, in the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable's income, however, rose by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of clients fluctuating like this.
For me, it's not an indication of a change in trend, did he notice.
This varies from one quarter to the other with a very lively competition.
Horse in beef products
The horse meat was found in beef-based containers, sold by two small British low-price distribution teachers, today announced the food hygiene agency.
routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save channels, contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
"Because horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke up in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's reviews, France was the country's most affected by the presence of such meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between the two vehicles caused four injuries, early Friday, on road 131, in Lanaudi√®re.
Just before 4 hours ago, a motorist who was driving north, in Saint-F√©lix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid of their lives.
The traffic returned to normal about 6 o'clock on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay the luggage by hand
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers who carry luggage by hand on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a handbag and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could bring the unopened cannet with them to the plane descent.
The new hand luggage costs relate to the bags in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said she would pay $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the travelers paid only once at the port of boarding.
Frontier's spokesperson, Kate O'Malley said that $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance.
"We don't want to pay this price," she explained.
Air carriers began to pay the first and second baggage registered in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as much stuff as they could in handbags in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in these compartments.
These charges are a means of ensuring that passengers carry less than anything on board.
O'Malley said that these new charges would not really be used to collect money.
This is to make it clear to the most faithful Frontier customers that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find the place in the superior compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's site will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making the tail at a borderier boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these charges before they reach the door.
Frontier baggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often look down on baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for them.
Many people at Wall Street consider adding baggage costs as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of the flight after years of losses.
However, many of them did not touch baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to airline Jay Sorensen, who follows the additional costs.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the cost of luggage at Spirit's hand was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently travelled on Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the boarding door when passengers would discover the unusual baggage costs imposed by the company.
"I've never seen a boating procedure so fluid in my entire professional career," he said.
I was expecting to see a toothbrush and a bagcar to blow up at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "passengers are on board at the speed of light."
Frontier also makes like Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can bring the unopened cannet with them, and those who take coffee can be booked free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after the passengers complained and no other large airline followed.
Frontier's decision to pay hand luggage costs when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Air companies pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of thousands of 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1 000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would make 250-miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful clientele in his hometown, Denver, but his activity goes back and she loses money.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its mother, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic has tried to reinstate Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA introduces a "internal error" rather than computer pirates for its site panel
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the bug of its public site for a few hours, and not some hackers like some of them claimed it online.
"The NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spionage agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the panel was due to a distributed service denial [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, the online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been on board for at least 6 hours, and some users are still unable to access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the agency was not "at all" compromises.
No classified information is in danger, explained the password.
At least one group of online activists claimed to be responsible for the NSA site panel by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks aim to launch a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-touch is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The NSA had previously been extremely secret, a time named "No Such Agency", was found under the fire of projectors and was strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs ‚Äì which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former consulting dissatisfaction of the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused many speculations that the incident of this evening was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who were going to turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Employers came to meet employees directly on the spot, employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of the Working Relations of the Delta Hotels, F√©lix Bisson.
Delta's closure takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had options to make.
Whether he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else, and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM Science School.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for older people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be up to two years old.
For Titan's PDG, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employees"
Having thrown out the sponge with failure in January for partial resumption of the Goodyear of Amiens-Nord site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of the U.S. pneumatic Titan, states today that it is ready to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 that counts the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After giving up the plant purchase project in January, you come back today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" per day, of "false" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries there are eight hours of disability in France.
In India, in China and in other countries, ten to twelve hours a day work.
But I don't have any prejudice on France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with the right price and competent workers, it's worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the closing announcement of the factory, Goodyear had offered the employees a good start compensation, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the factory closed at Goodyear.
At the same time, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country of the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the factory of Amiens with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
Mr. Montebourg also needs a Titan commitment before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to enter into an agreement on the starting allowances for all employees.
Then there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on the starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide long-term job guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg finds out that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the factory, we have a plan to stay in Friends-North for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit is down, while delivery and flight orders are down.
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent fall in its net profit on Thursday, under the pressure of lower orders and delivery of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains Division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has no longer provided flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious commercial service schedule before next September.
After the inaugural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the pilot only flew three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not expected and the rate of action declined by 8 per cent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank of Finance, reduced his rating on Thursday, from "surperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential of increase in the stock exchange during the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although the drop in air delivery has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to the customers.
We believe that Bombardier will record new commands for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program will advance.
However, if no new order has been announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more suspicious about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of today's market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was released in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries planes is modest to date at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential of the new liner economies.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and procurement commitments from 15 clients and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and head of management, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm commands before the first aircraft is placed in commercial service.
The leaders also assured analysts and the media on Thursday, stating that the program was moving forward in line with the timetable.
"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than planned," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the flight's stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take the first flight and provide for an update period, and that is what we did.
This will take place throughout the flight schedule.
The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first client can only fly a CSeries plane 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was evaluating the schedule of entry into service and will provide further information in the coming months.
"This slowing of flight tests ‚Äì although it appears to be in line with Bombardier's internal calendar ‚Äì strengthens our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
At the third quarter close on September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents by action, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents by action, a year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income slightly decreased from $4.2 to $4.1 Md.
Analysts were expected to result in 10 cents per action and income of $4.56 Md, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net controls were dropped to 26 aircraft, against 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 billion as at 30 September, an unchanged figure compared to 31 December of the previous year.
"In the Air Force, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13 per cent to reach $2 Md.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that the revenues of this division had increased from nearly 11% to 2.1 billion dollars.
The transport division's order book totaled $32.6 billion as at 30 September, a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered execution problems for some large contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The course of Bombardier's actions, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc's financial management, would sit in the board, dropped from 8.5% to $4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aircraft manufacturer in the world and competing with the closest to Bombardier, reported a 10% decline in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23 and 27-year-old spellers were taken missing in a dyke under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, it was learned on Friday with the Spel√©o rescue of Is√®re.
They were located this Friday-after-morning.
The two men, one in practice and the other in practice, went underground on Thursday at 2:30 p.m. to perform a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We've been out of the news since then, and the same source has been specified.
"Spelegologists should have pointed out around 5 o'clock in the morning," said Thierry Larribe, a technical adviser to Spel√©o relief in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of persons on site
Twenty rescuers, ten members of the French Speleo rescue team, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cave, have transmitted information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphin√©.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chamb√©ry, were found "expulsioned but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their steps while waiting for relief, specified the prefecture.
Realized, they should emerge from the cave with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union invited its adherents on Thursday to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services following new revelations on the activities of the United States and British information services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends journalists to avoid up to a new order to use search engines and Google and Yahoo messages," she said in a communiqu√©.
She considered the Washington Post 's scandalous' information, according to which the National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected mass of information by infiltrating the international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 supporters.
Repeated light: a Member requests the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project by the minister Brigitte Grouwels of "relifting" fires in Brussels does not please everyone.
The Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a test project consisting of redesigning 16 lighthouses in the region with yellow and blue colours.
The aim is to both "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the end, to repeat all the Brussels signal lights for an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flaming" the capital and demands the "demission" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"It is not good to spend entirely the money of the Brusselsi in lifting the signaling poles to the colors of the Brusselsi region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his Flemishing Operations of the Capital," said Mr. De Bock in a communiqu√©.
After her yellow-mangue-black taxis, she finally repeated herself in dark-black-yellow yellow-black boots in Brussels.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than to see their money spent by a CD&V minister who realizes the NVA program itself.
It's a long time to stop Troie's horse from Flanders.
"For the record, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes or 0.5% of the Brusselsers," concludes Mr De Bock.
the Portique de Pont-de-Bus removed
The Portique ecotaxe of Pont-de-Buis, which took place on Saturday a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Grapes arrived on the ground shortly after 10 hours, and the movement on the national side was diverted into the crowd.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of the Finist√®re on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, Portique Manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax ports to operate in the department of Finist√®re, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launching a Google Glass accessory shop
An online store, offering multiple Google Glass accessories, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google's connected lenses.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger, or even a set-up tube.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a micro-fibre-made protective housing or an intra-aural earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correcting glass, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At the beginning I refused his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequent."
There is no recipe, no method of employment to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then there were signs.
The first time this was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a mild awakening in the night to watch his watch that doesn't leave me, placed on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father who's accompanying me in my everyday gestures.
Our mother left us after her fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found her body empty, spat on this hospital bed with the cold drapes.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial adieu focused around the soft light candles that would fall into his circle.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little day or night appearances, a little shy, a little obscure, she quickly came back into my mind, evolved in the fur and as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that was in mourning.
And then she revealed herself to me by revealing my own faces that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnates that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her full and complete.
This distance from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my dad, "on the inside like on the outside" he looks like.
I've always been told.
I never believed him at the time.
I've had difficult relationships with him until he gets old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him anymore, and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He was talking to me, he was always encouraging me, he lived my body.
I saw his hands watching my hands, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me alone.
It took a long time then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are not anymore, but I constantly feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought?
I keep dreaming about them, maybe not every night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always something that keeps me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up anxious when that happens to me and I feel deeply about their absence.
Sometimes dreams lead me to the contrary and to my history and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The night of my echoography, where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I would wake up, I would get out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he would cheer me up, and I was happy to wait for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he shared with joy what had happened to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I'm glad to tell you this shared memory that lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother was dying of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused the young bachelor I was at the time.
I've done everything I've done pretty quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, at the point of making a master in a large school, was not, with the decline, anodinian choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I can think about how she would like me to act at a given time.
The same is true of my attitudes: I try to be at the height of generosity and the correctness of the spirit of the one who was a zealous believer.
Now, I feel like a daily presence, a kind soul, a saving spirit.
I see her eyes staring at me.
My mother died ten years ago now.
She died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstandings, anger, pain, tears that come out alone, no matter where, in unusual places, unusual moments.
Then the time came for the punishment.
It was only the lack, the lack of answers, the need to trust me, to reassure me at the cross of its mildness.
Yet, she's here, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see her eyes worried to sit on me, I see the candles that brighten her eyes, the lips that grow cigarettes, the most that mark the front of the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of three children died of a 43-year-old cancer.
We are constantly feeling his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we had little to laugh at, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to her in the creek of the night when the absence is too bad, she's invited into my dreams when morals are a little caught up.
We feel worn out and protected in difficult times, the downfall of time makes us realize how much she was the head of the orchestra and we try to stay in the way she had led us.
If a person has loved you very much, the absence can not draw you from the heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from an amateur cancer suite.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his inhumation, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I sometimes have different beliefs than hers, I still wonder if my actions are consistent with her vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in a different way, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he's going to think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, it's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
I was about thirty years old when my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6 years old.
The immense pain that then invaded me certainly slowed down, but it's always close to me.
Very often he "departs" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that in the wake I am even more sad to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with a voice so real that I woke up in the air, anxious, and I lit the headlight looking everywhere, convinced that he was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel noticed and I come back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world, I would not leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since I left, it is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to say that I am social with a responsible profession, I laugh and I sing, I'm out, I'm my grandmother, I'm full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the month of the most murder in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Prime Minister of Iraq received the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be on our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not regulated, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will spread as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Nouri al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They were marketing banners to the accused, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid his secret addiction to drugs was not revealed to the big day.
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Liverpool Trial Court
A major defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of an important police investigation because he feared his secret addiction to drugs was not revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the master of the crime Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug-related activities after being compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was named "Bash" and considered by the criminals as a "first-time record", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police-directed police operations to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers reported Sarborough, 32 years old, depositing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a Barreau dinner with nurses.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully information on the arrest of two men for Scarborough's account and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police in an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for ¬£1.5 million, as well as more than ¬£200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the criminals because he was afraid that her drug addiction would not be revealed at large.
Today, at Liverpool's court of inquiry, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Requestor's office in Blackburn, was indiscriminate after being found guilty of two charges against justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The drop of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, found that he had been regularly in contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and noticed him coming to Dinta's home and placing the drugs, which is 60 percent, under the lawyer's jaws in a black golf course.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, a member of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to use cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the drug dealer suspected because it was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a sample of hair was taken.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that customers were calling him at his home for legal matters.
But the court heard evidence that he called major actors in the drug trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were in the news.
Procurator Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that he doesn't need to violate the law, he's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He was too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he let himself be compromised.
Ditta refused any illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police stated: "Mr. Dinta has passed from a criminal lawyer to himself since he began to seek drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has never compromised it and has made it vulnerable to the backdrops of members of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have been responsible for obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to get behind his profession's paint.
The Lancashire Crime Unit has conducted an investigation into Mr. Ditta, who has been found to be guilty of the three leaders in charge of possession of cocaine and is now in the process of infringing justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and translate you into court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after complaining of complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a meeting of questions/answers on herself during which he said his dream job would be a lawyer to represent clients in the course of death in America, his last invitation to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be on stage in December
The newspaper Detroit News reports that the soul queen will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board room at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Ms. Franklin dealt with the recording of an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds in November.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, the famous performer of Respect had said to the media on 16 October that the secondary effects of treatment she received were "hard".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of his Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2,2 kilometres of seaboard covered with a light coat: the heat cut in Menton could be broken with the lighting bill.
A bill that, contrary to many commons, is also regulated by taxpayers, not by associations of traders.
To alleviate its costs, the city has used aids.
But also a different management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened the fire.
According to local police, there would have been at least 2 injuries.
It would be an employee working for the United States Transport Safety Administration (TSA) and the author of firefights.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Travelers and staff flocked to the exits or on the tarmac.
The police were very quick to intervene and a man suspected of being the shooter was caught on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
From classical song for adolescents
Every time, it is the school client who will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five phrases conceived and interpreted by artists in the region, vineyards with a high dose of humor, adolescents are allowed to take advantage of the classical song.
In addition to this show, the Society of lyrical art of the Kingdom will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that now completes the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in summer 2014, giving artists in the region the opportunity to show what they are capable of.
These activities were added to the lyrical Apero, the beneficial concert held last August, with the competition of the soprano coloration Marie-√âve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as an air of the hot air.
Without providing specific figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to prove himself reassuring.
Despite the precautionary nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is well drawn, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"The finances are fleeting and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would say even more," added the Director General, H√©l√®ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey's school faces six accused heads, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, threatening, carrying weapons in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to disarm the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Packaget via communication.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective appeal against the Saint-Croix brothers
A new application for collective appeal was filed against the Saint-Croix brothers concerning sexual assaults that would occur this time in the Oratorium of Saint-Joseph as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J.J.", which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the brother Sumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, in the speech of Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a minister and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed only at three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people said to us, "I was in such a place, was it that I could sign up?" says Lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal which has just been filed has in particular to allow the addition of complainants to any institution where services could have been carried out by members of the Saint-Croix Congregation.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Saint-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stresses that the Saint-Croix Congregation and the Oratorium of Saint-Joseph, which is a distinct entity, "have allowed sexual abuses to be committed against children", that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological burden on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuses committed and have nevertheless been committed", and that they have "slowly and deliberately chosen to ignore the problem".
These recent accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by Sainte-Croix's lawyer, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Sainte-Croix's brother who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the admissibility accepted by the Court is taken at the second stage, that is, the hearings on the ground.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Saint-Croix had agreed to settle with the friendly before hearings were held on the ground.
Importance of fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the surrounding LaSale, in Montreal, on Thursday night to Friday.
The reliefs were called about 1 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had been declared underground in an Indian cuisine restaurant on the Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with the R√©jane Street.
Thirty firemen who were sent to the places spent about an hour controlling the brewery.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building", said the chief of operations of the Fire Safety Service in Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injured, but almost twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this commercial area, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might have to be temporarily housed, the SIM indicated.
Many opposition to medical aid to death at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Conference of Palliative Care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Bill on Medical Assistance to Die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would like to end their days, according to a spokesperson of the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the Euthanasia approach would be minimal.
The President of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte D√©ry is concerned about the consequences of the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of Palliative Care Houses, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also head of the Mathieu-Froment-Savowie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless in any way.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Association of Palliative Care, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec Bill disorients the population regarding the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario's gonna get the fuck out of it.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, St√©phanie Vall√©e, said that the concept of the end of life should be clarified before the bill was adopted.
The Kenyan Press Says the Media Controversy Act
"It is a defiant country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from flouting the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper, contesting the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group, owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected radio stations and Internet sites of independent modernity in Kenya.
He said that the new media court "will always be partial because it is a extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "handling on the media". The Standard stated, as far as it is concerned, that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya had "suddenly suffered" and festered the bill as a "draconian".
The adoption of the bill is at the same time a train of measures to strengthen national security in the siege carried out by armed Islamists in the business centre of Westgate last September.
The kenyens media have provoked the anger of the authorities by spreading images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the attack scene were decomposing the luxury shopping centre.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the summons was withdrawn from the media as a result of an increase in loopholes.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to amendments up to 20 million shillings kenys and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "radiated" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations".
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animal blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, political men know that they can do what they want in any impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the media kenys as a key source of control in public life.
"In books themselves, political men would defeat the country and bring us back to hunting and hunting."
The Kenyan legislators have been the target of the people's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission on Salaries and restored their Mirobollant Salaries of approximately 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax ‚Äì which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) in Laval caused a total excitement at the direction of the City-de-la-Sant√© Hospital, which was in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement leave, maternity leave or short leave, the pharmaceutical department was very poor in staff.
Nearly 30% of the necessary personnel were missing, making this financial year very difficult, according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to engage in independent work, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We haven't been able to take advantage of the landing, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been rationalized or reduced, while things are being replaced.
Of course, we worked hard to interest our young [pharmacians] so they come and stay here.
There was a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this severe period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the pharmaceutical department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in the last few months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain fruit have been successful, as the four students are currently resident in Laval also decided to remain in the use of the CSSS.
Now, this is going a lot better, the pharmacist stressed.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will then complete our departures from last year.
ever-increasing benefits
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the field, make living in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always careful, because we have a young environment and a lot of young women are employed, so with pregnant women, we are almost always on three maternity leave when it goes well, has it added.
Over the last year, there has been a lot more and there are no pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career in cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose him to incarnate Charlotte Gainsburg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This vicious porn drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), is the erotic memories of an adult quadrennial of sex.
Stacy Martin's likeness with his grandfather is striking: a brothel silhouette, a diaphne tent and Franco-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to put naked on the ice paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on the screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac caused the temperature to rise on the Table: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in the extaise with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their power in the poster, he had used X professionals for the most ossetian sex scenes before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the double.
From Bj√∂rk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing his actors into their last break-ins, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A CGR room of Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday night, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precaution, following the bites to the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the head of the facility made an evacuation of the room and prevented firearms for a suspicious smell.
About 70 persons were released from the meeting.
People have been examined and full recognition of the room has not given anything.
Bad jokes on the bottom of the lacremogene jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the film management has played the precautionary principle and the security of its deep clients.
The room was aired and everything was back in order.
The cinema was able to resume its rights and the customers found the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into lemons
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine dissipated into the country at Montr√©al-Trudeau airport on Thursday morning.
It was during the passenger baggage examination that the drug was detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three barrels that had been previously empty.
The drug was then transported to the Office of the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie (GRC) who took the lead in the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not reveal where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Robby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she arrived in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border officials at the airport of Montreal-Trudeau have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, the border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 drug seizures.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but hits took place in the evening.
A short-range SA-8 short-air missile load would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid on Tsahal's aviation in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances close to the one that had taken place on July 5th: at that time it was also an anonymous U.S. officer who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aimed at this time at the suicide missiles Yakhont, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The standard & Poor's rating agency has reduced Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic to meet its financial obligations for more than a year.
The country's public debt note goes to "B-", focusing on the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one chance on three that it is again down by one year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external funding needs," explains the US agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of foreign loans.
These reservations, which the authorities have made massive use of to support local currency, the Hryvnia, as the agency finds itself to be more and more likely to judge an evaluation, which would inflame its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which charges that it has not paid an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of living tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public on the day following the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered from its fifth quarter between July and September as a result of the contract.
Its slowdown, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimated it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budgetary deficit, has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it $15.3 billion in 2010 and has now only $3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new instalment until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
As a result of a new non-profit mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important needs for external funding" constituted "vulnerability", as well as "significance of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "no short-term improvement can be expected".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," Presidential elections are scheduled in 2015, according to the expert, interviewed by the AFP.
The only hope is to improve the international economy.
S&P also notes the "insecurity" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditionals on the release of the opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative consequences in short and medium-term terms related to Russia's reaction," S&P explained, fearing "commercial restrictions" on Moscow.
Russia, which represents the fourth of Ukrainian exports, has predicted that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
Green light from the United States to the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday that they had not received any objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus drawing closer to the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger is indeed approaching the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review period of the merger previously announced by Publicis Group and Omnicom, as foreseen by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", announces both groups in a communiqu√©.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HRR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions necessary for the implementation of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and the approval of shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese Army seeks the rebels of the M23
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were to continue the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu border of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the point of being beaten after being chased from the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that he had been in control of the insurrection since the beginning 20 months ago.
"We are going to pursue the M23 and welcome it wherever it is hiding because it is criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson for FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have martyred the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to restore peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military appeals would not alter his claims to peace talks in any way.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, took place in Kampala on Wednesday between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Affirmatives are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was seen today in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of the province of North Kivu, profiting from the escape of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission to RDC, the world's most important in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade consisting of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC's state-of-the-art has been remanded and the army has turned to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to reach its end," said a Congolese business expert Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historical - it would be the first time Kinshasa‚Äôs government managed to overcome a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
United Nations experts are calling on Rwanda, which is not far behind it, to provide military support to the M23, which is at the start of the mutiny Congolese military.
The head of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to prove his detention, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals as a result of shells falling into Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the people of Bunagana invaded the streets of the bourgeoisie to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unthinkable to us to be released by the army," one of Uganda's inhabitants testifies.
"We lived in terror (M23), we were traumatized," he added.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus have proved negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date."
Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease had already caused about fifty deaths.
Chevron, the second US oil company, reported a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refinery margins, while its production of oil and gas increased while still withdrawing from the group's objectives.
Its net profit for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, compared with $5.25 billion or $2.69 per action, a year ago.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged $2.71 in profit.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, rising from 2.52 million bpj produced one year ago.
The company aims at 2.55 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly to the third quarter, while the profits from down-turn activities (including refining and chemical production) dropped from 45 per cent to $380 million.
This drop in refinery margins affects the whole sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil said Thursday a net down profit, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has since the beginning of the school year required the cost of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving school transport at two residences, a service provided by the organization when it is able to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was required.
"There is a mediation service proposed by the committee and I was interested," explains Mrs. Lef√®vre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, work together and find solutions," says Mrs. Lef√®vre.
The School Committee of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the urgencys of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the background of a number of months of staff and several trade unions, including CGT, Health Minister Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "cut down the implementation schedule of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergency that will not take place on 4 November".
An official application was made "to avoid any risk of taking care of the emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed at not depriving the PS campaign for a few months from the municipalities.
In spite of the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective at this date.
Even if the APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firefighters who would provide about a quarter of the 40,000 annual crossings at the Hotel-God emergency will all have received to ensure that thirty serious cases are brought daily to the emergency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the hospitals.
At the Hotel-Gode, emergency specialized interiors will be held on Monday to five General Medicine interiors.
With regard to the transfer of internal medical beds, it is programmed for the current month.
"The hotel-God emergency reception service must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," ensures without delay Lo√Øc Capron, the president of the APHP Medical Commission (CME), who supports the draft direction.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he said, as a result of the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on-site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain in place, will they also ensure?
But it is for the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"The things are happening progressively," says Nicolas P√©ju, spokesperson of the ARS for whom, on 4 November, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," laments urgent doctor Gerald Kierzek.
Released from its position as Head of the SMUR in early July to have led the front against the reorganisation project, it is defined as a "warner" in relation to a "cynic" decision made by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergency that was renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they're getting pregnant on a regular basis.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for Lariboisi√®re emergencies.
In the ARS, it is claimed that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not at risk of representing a "valanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also be strengthened.
In the ARS as well as in the APHP, the "new hospital model" has been on the way since 7 October and should continue to welcome 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist doctors should also participate in the establishment of "permanence of outpatient care".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose," asks Gerald Kierzek, for which "the concept of no serious urgency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will happen as for grade 3 maternity.
People are not mad, they're going where there's the best offer of care.
If the Minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the braquet, says Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the Nathalie Koscisko-Morizet team, Vincent Roger, a Paris UMP advisor and elected to the 4th roundabout, clearly announces that "even though the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we returned to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would mark her net disagreement, points out Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot accept it without an acceptable schedule of return to other hospitals.
Obama ends the IMF and the World Bank hearings
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to terminate its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its information activities, a United States official said Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume its hand in the matter of NSA hearings after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank monitoring has been mentioned by the information agency since the start of the scandal.
Questioned about this, a U.S. government official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance for the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Expressing itself under the seal of the anonymity, that responsibility did not specify whether such supervision had been established in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be discontinued over the past weeks.
This instruction was given at almost the same time as the one that put an end to the headphones of the U.S. headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Information Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday, but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that information agencies are authorized to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been established 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in the development of the ‚Äúsustainable development goals‚Äù aimed at replacing the MDGs, which will expire in 2015 before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that it was now time to "exceed national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and adapt to the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These ODAs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Security-related concern in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts erupt among powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, while washing them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a tea-shirt with the word "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowded crowd in the place of the Independence of Thursday capital.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day of reports of conflicts between the government forces and Renamo, the worst linkage since the peace agreement that was signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported in the start by the white-run Rhodesia and then the South African apartheid government in efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into an open conflict, but recent events have derailed foreign investors and the local population.
The issue is considerable for the full growth economy as the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and carbon deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion of investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the power party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo both reject the responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the origin of recent confrontations and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional base of Renamo on 17 October.
The beatings on the former rebels then degenerate when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering the conflicts, and the charge of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize the concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said on Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga stated that Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume the negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties failed to calm the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who don't stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open and specialist university in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections before it took place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war on the part of the government.
The share of the suffrage collected by Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, should obtain a greater number of suffrage in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza ‚Äì who should withdraw at the end of his second term of office next year ‚Äì wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has carried out very disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway axis.
Most of the junctions took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has reinforced the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the country's future leaders are the government and the president, and that it is the latter to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "life-style models," says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "the brutal force does not make the weight against subtle Russians", while the Argentine legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "very violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscenous to be taught at school", Crossley-Holland recommended a "minute selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it amazing that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been complaining about this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are ‚Äúopenly educational‚Äù makes children‚Äú completely decoy, ‚Äù the messages being ‚Äúsublime‚Äù in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be subdued; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The basis is known for what we show and that we don't say it.
A fighter of the Hamas army was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli car shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists carried out a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they shot an Israeli blind.
NSA espionage: the United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the matter of espionage, he acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Washington-wide debate with Europe on the mass data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and slander between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time an American government official explicitly accepts the practices disputed in the interception by NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I commend you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this is no longer happening in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London that he has been participating since Thursday, October 31, through video link.
In his retransmitted intervention, in the presence of British counterpart William Hague, the head of the U.S. diplomacy has long justified information and information practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured the US authorities that many attacks had been launched, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented airplanes from falling, buildings from exploding and people being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the US diplomacy pattern argued.
And John Kerry said to the address of Europeans, "I assure you that in this process, innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to collect information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already expressed himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel wrong".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to rage this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The journal, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British NSA homologue, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by Internet giants.
One of the documents believed that some 181 million items had been collected during the only month of January - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have received massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the wrath of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the US president was not aware of such rumors, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the master of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the ball to European intelligence services that would be seized of these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would be "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not be the case for Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy extended to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has convened the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international sponning network that has also caused China to suffer.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master's authority, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League Club 1 in a communiqu√©.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco with the difference of goals, has published the list of players held for this 12th day match, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The communiqu√© simply indicates that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered a left knee inflammation at the time of his selection return, at the beginning of months.
A memorial ceremony for the cremated dead
At 11 a.m., Father Lachase's crematorium organizes a lay ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in his institution during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris mayor's office, will attend and then explain at a press conference his funeral proposals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obese, more and more French choose cremation, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For a neighbor's obese, this is the reverse: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the trouble of losing a child, they're only 15% to choose the cremation.
In his book La Mort en ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, emphasizes the "violence" that constitutes cremation for survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence committed to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, which "will accompany the phases of grief".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which holds the "escapement of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymate" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without punishment in certain Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," answered Marie-Fr√©d√©rique Bacqu√©, president of the Society of Heatology and author of the book Approve death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to suppress it.
To welcome the cremation, it is for Fran√ßois Michaud-N√©rard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to arrange for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one to whom he would be entitled with an inhumation.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their neighbors, whether it is religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Now 73% of those who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately following the removal of the ashes," observed Mr. Michaud-N√©rard.
70% of the institutions now propose ceremonies, which are held in the presence of the body at the following ritual: welcoming the assembly, appointing the deceased, linking the others, calling it out, giving meaning to his death, organizing the adjournment.
This has been the case with Father Lachase's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, since 2010, La Toussaint's crematorium has organized several commemorative, secular and non-religious ceremonies, to which he invites the families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted in line, with the attention of those who could not move.
The crematorium allowed us to relax.
A La Seyne, Relogation for Rats turns to controversy
Early in the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fruccidor D2 building because of the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the South Habitat Land Office proposed, in an exceptional and temporary manner, to relog the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took excessive proportions, according to Jo√´l Canapa, the director of the office.
There's always been rats in the cities.
The deratisation company carries out two shifts a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
We have thus made 64 interventions since the end of the last winter.
The neighborhood is not left behind, and rats do not pulverize in the city.
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, sure, but for two rats, a cat will not be killed.
"We didn't invite rats at our house," protests the family father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the sour and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday in spite of good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rate paid off the decline of the dollar against the yen, prejudicial to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and Topix increased 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.33.
Sony dropped from more than 11% to 1 668 yens.
A house for the flames in the Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than thirty firemen were sent to the 9th of Hebert Street.
Flames were declared in a three-storey house on four floors behind the Qu√©bec Seminary Court.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled one hour after the arrival of the firemen, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms happened, because it took the strength to attack the building, because there are buildings caught here," explained France Loiselle, spokesperson for the firefighters in Quebec.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of vaudeville Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell lies directly to the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was recently resumed by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolina stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the posters went to Carolina, and they were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for the benefit of former combatants, organized at Madison Square Garden, where they will be present, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has taken on a large scale, just like the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have been visited by non-traditional circuits, such as small television shows, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a wired chain ("The League") on the theme of fantasy football cheerfully lascife of the FXX chain and now has his own show of sketches on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the "parks and Recreation" cast, but she is still more known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians in the single voice (the pessimist, Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an official comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held at the Hotel de Ville, downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two buildings and said, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here."
The oil price continues to decline and closes to $96 the barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday, while stock concerns accounted for a report showing that the Chinese Gourmand electricity manufacturing sector is strengthening itself.
The US gross reference price for delivery in December dropped from $14.24 to $96.24 in late morning in Europe during electronic exchange on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% decrease for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the last few weeks.
The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which showed growth in activity, suggested an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to recover after growth has increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decrease that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
The gross Brent, a reference to the international gross already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 the barrier on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Withdrawal of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal appeal court restored some restrictions on the right of voluntary abortion in Texas that had been blocked by a court of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and that the right to abortion is largely challenged will enter into force.
The judgment given by the appeal court means that doctors who practice IVG should have a "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his status as a hospital member, to accept a patient in a hospital or medical centre to issue a diagnosis or treatment.
The defenders of the IVG argue that the content of the law is likely to result in an immediate closure of a third of State clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be nearly 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a court judge had taken the view at the time of the entry into force of the Act that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were anti-constitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, the Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the Governor's position, asked the court to cancel the trial of the first instance that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has successfully returned to force, alongside hearings, with 1.3 million TV viewers behind their TV station, 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show on your date?
Some 10,000 candidates were present at the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the Persian Andr√© Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored at this first prize.
Like every year, the first auditions create a wide selection of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, a few found their account.
They are many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to be gone to the end.
Behind television screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on NYPD's policy of control and investigation
A federal appeal court blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed the case.
The United States Appeal Court (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the appeal by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and question citizens.
The city called for its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in modifying its policy and training program associated with it.
The appeal court heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which it responded publicly to the criticisms of the court.
The judge had found that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men in their control and search program.
She designated an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in areas where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of preserving the names and addresses of the people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the city should take place after 14 March 2014.
Many civil rights defenders have criticised the tactics of monitoring and research.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that mainly concern black men and Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and became a collective action.
Participants proposing changes in the NYPD's monitoring and search program say that they will put an end to unfair practices, allow more effective and reliable police forces, and will be able to change how police departments use policy.
The opponents say that these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and do not solve the wider problem of pressured police forces after police officers have been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that it did not end the practices of control and investigation, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants have to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the apartment that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each accommodation.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the City.
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us artificial lights at $100,000, land of $4 to $5 million for the case where...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elys√©e
Entered into 500 m2 of the elysene kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the cook made all the steps to become head, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou to Fran√ßois Hollande by passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and fed an incalculable number of great people in this world in a nearly anonymous one that breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years.
The man with the open face, skull degarni and intellectual glasses, born 24 October 1953 in Fert√©-Saint-Aubin, is the holder of a CAP of pastry.
His mother was herself a cook in a Sologne castle.
"I have passed from castle to castle!", ironic Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrative guests.
"He's always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," as she had forbidden women in the kitchens of Elise !
It does not move to Heads of State who displayed relative indifference to land-based food, "they are all gourmets," politely complains Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had some "a slightly more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed cheese, the seats returned empty!
As for Fran√ßois Hollande, who restored cheese, "there's someone who likes to eat" and "there's no big deal he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who returned the lost pounds before the presidential campaign, has ‚Äúno specific regime application‚Äù.
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially at the state dinners at Elysate: it should serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before, it's almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were errors.
The former chef of the kitchen of Elys√©e, who took a glass Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, went with a painting in the heart."Fran√ßois Hollande came to greet me."
He said compliments.
"His human side is resonated," he says.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been for his part for seventeen years in Elys√©e.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the fireflaming in the Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The building of four houses, located on the 15th of Hebert Street, was subjected to three fire alarms.
The fire went ahead, but it rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Qu√©bec Fire Protection Service, pointed out that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a challenge of size for this sector of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The fire house opened four apartments, but no tenant was in the place at the time of the fire.
The damage has been limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the flavors have separated the thesis from a criminal act.
The Wall Street Loop: Out of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out a few images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York courtier, is incarcerated by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will disappoint you in his role as a trade agent.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long Island Stock Exchange broker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in the context of a vast corruption case at Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort went up with a rope that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the vertigo fall that will follow.
Without limits, man is faking parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and overindulgence in all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had joined them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese took too long due to its installation.
It would seem that the film lasts at 2:45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscar race for justice.
Coulson used the phone piracy to check a tube
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a twin tube on a connection involving the Interior Minister then in exercise, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the Court of Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "beautiful special adviser".
It was reported to the court that Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, was charged with hacking Pawlby's voice box and "planting at his door all the time," but Coulson also called it and left him with voice messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house waiting to surprise them, is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate topics: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what's the first?
Does he know about phone piracy?
He claims otherwise, but we say, ‚ÄúOf course I do. ‚Äù
The speakers on a connection involving Clarke were taken first by the NotW editing office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said that she had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voice messages were recorded pirated on its phone at least three times, was arrested at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators also found arrests on the private detective's computer that involved Ms. Pawlby and her sister listed in a "Projects" file.
During the time that the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, the former head reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former head reporter James Weatherup monitored the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's minor facts and actions.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defender Rebecca Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to have co-operated with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to performing telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, full of violence
The US President was expected to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of United States aid to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
In October, Iraq experienced its month of murder in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people were killed in the violence in October, 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance sheet with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence is becoming more and more horrendous despite enhanced security measures and major military operations launched months ago by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence scares a new hug while neighbouring Syria is on the verge of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men have been beaten in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being marginalized politically and of being the target of unjust arrests, has promoted this flame of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
A large part of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida ( Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of the United States interviews with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, which will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end the military commitment in that country, had set up an optimistic table of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the congressional electors.
On Thursday, he appealed for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by republican and democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, who was partly responsible for the resumption of violence by his "sector and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded from Barack Obama that he make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Pekin accuses a youth group of the Tiananmen attack
The Chinese Home Security Chief accused on Friday of following the assassination of a group of Chinese separatists from Xinjiang who killed five people at Tiananmen Square in the center of Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, sunk on the crowd that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital, symbol of the murder of 1989, and took fire killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkey of being the instigator of this attack.
Many ears, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province the eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for frequent outbreaks of violence, which are fueled by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organised and pre-empted," said Meng at the Hong Kong-Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that was held in brackets was the Islamic movement of East Turkey," he added, as his speech was repeated by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that it was originally oyghoor and stated that his wife and his mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained fuel-filled containers and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident has caused 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement of East Turkey is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican polls on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and married couples of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of the bishops, with the aim of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important meeting on the family that Pope Fran√ßois plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic journal of the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of the Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in an appropriate manner to examine the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: the army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The M23's irreducibles, a few hundred combatants, were reduced to nearly 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Joba, two locations about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continue despite the night," AFP reported to a resident of Jomba, connected by phone at 12:30 p.m., and said that a girl was injured by a ball in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have slightly repulsed the rebels."
According to this witness who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "rising operation".
It was very clearly heard behind him of the nurturings of small arms.
From Bunagana, political fief and the last strong place of the rebellion fallen on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to one source to the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fights entered "in a final phase", the FARDCs having "closed the residual positions of the M23 to release them".
Since the resumption on Friday, the clashes between the 23 March movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco has not been directly involved in the fight, but it provides the government troops with a critical support for information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied in ammunition, mounted in the direction of the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, borderline with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians carried a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC flaming truck, to ensure that another machine was used to lift the M23's positions on the hills.
The Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on the rebels again on Wednesday night to "demobilize themselves voluntarily" without being "armed by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without results for the moment.
On the contrary, the political leaders of the M23 hoped to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it is only the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without any confirmation of this information immediately on the government side.
M23 was born in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which rejects Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its sub-floor is dedicated to mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had been refugees between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC that had turned in the morning was reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to return," said Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back.
It is felt that fire strikes are approaching populations.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this beast of stage
Classical, sophisticated, popular, English or French, the productions sing and dance take on their envelopes.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's rock opera, most of the attempts would get stuck in the ridicule.
And success like Cabaret or the Miserables carried the mystery aureol.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Ch√¢telet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes maintain the titles as successful tubes.
The first one, this Christmas, is an excellent My Fair Lady and announces the following world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the success of the season.
On other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "Bastille's lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are placed in the range of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of Musical Comedy" and lecture at the Theatre of Ch√¢telet, analyzes the reasons for success so hard.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the heart of producers...
Some use beautiful images projections and a true history as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year-old bond under the pretext that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of the poster.
After that, we have musical comedies with the suspicious productions of the Ch√¢tellet that bring us to life the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes English-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to lose weight.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of Araigned Women" or "The Awakening of Spring" are bad to be financed.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the music comedy berth is very different.
Young people are trained in these fields in many schools.
Jobs are many among the regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The livery of talent is also a result of the number of positions to be held.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theatre plays go on tour, and it is often the boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Music shows cover this gap.
They're the same young people who love television reality and what it produces as epherean stars...
To offer beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of the engagement of these young women and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are certainly held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith province.
The Mayonnaise is raised in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the great halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning at 5:30 p.m., on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who's being compensated for it.
The ring was closed to the traffic up to 9 a.m. at the site of the accident, the time when the road is delayed and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation has not caused much confusion as the accident occurred at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic can therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child badly injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured as a result of an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed to new order.
RDC: Army prepares a new test
Children play on a carbonized shield belonging to the rebels of the M23 in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in the East of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new trial on Friday against the last bases of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in the East of the DRC.
The aim is to disarm the M23 of the hills that surpass Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which surpasses that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from herself.
There will be no more than the hill of Runyonyi.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," said the AFP Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
Five political and last strong place of the rebellion, this town is located at the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irreductibles have been reduced to nearly 2,000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and nearby Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported fighting every Thursday throughout the day said that the situation was "slow since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the old man and were buried.
One girl was injured by a bullet, and three others were injured, including a scratch, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the battles between FARDC and the rebels on October 25, the two fighters have given no balance to the loss of human life.
The NSA's revelations increase the company's paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On behalf of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Information Agency was responsible for photographing the roof of the U.S. office, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV expected to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation resulted in an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. intelligence services, once again stressed in September that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "feel the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant, has become a denunciation, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of United States surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director in words.
Reports, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency spyed the Brazilian Petroleum Company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever raised company paranoia with regard to State surveillance.
The revelation that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to be drained.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between US and business information services transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said BITMI President Oliver Gr√ºn, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States is as important a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the EY counsellor's office.
However, in all the documents published by Mr Snowden, nothing to date indicates that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Political men expressed concern at the fact that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believes that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German MP says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the right way to do it,‚Äù says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company‚Äôs software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we did not have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, passing through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the magnitude and sophistication of American espionage agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations was a shock to some companies who thought until then that China represented the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials are aware that the data retained in the United States is governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional agency, about 10% of non-American members have given up their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after revelations on the US Data Exploration Program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our customers today ask us a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at any price.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring subject for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, director general of the BASF chemical producer company.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally less inclined to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, if this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
The large companies have long overhauled the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB key at a professional lounge or leave a laptop without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car manufacturer's board, says that the collection of mobile phones before the council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid during their travel abroad due to the risk of contact with the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France as well as Russia and Israel, who were guilty of the second degree of economic information piracy, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Interior, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, who dies in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a carpet of fighting in the gymnasium of her high school, think their son was murdered, said the lawyer of the family Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11th in a carpet backed up behind the grades of his high school.
The investigators of the Sheriff of the County of Lowdes concluded that Johnson was dead in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family questioned these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the Sheriff's conclusions.
"They think that this challenges any logic, the laws of physics and the common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a cartridge and they were taken to a mortuary bag," he added.
The U.S. Attorney Michael Moore stated Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore expressed himself at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts where they're going.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was killed by "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to carry it out.
The representative of the sheriff's office in the County of Lowness was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to return all the video surveillance records that the investigators had examined on Wednesday.
Adolescent parents said they hoped that video images contained clues about the circumstances of their death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children for school purposes
Wednesday, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage child food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergies has increased considerably.
A child in 20 in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the teacher's body and staff to food allergies in the child, and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock ‚Äì the EpiPen brand self-injector being the most commonly used ‚Äì to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States recently updated the regulations to enable schools to have more easily of epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something touches my tongue," "I have the impression of having a hair on my tongue" or "I have picotes on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on information
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on one side goes public by convening the US Ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran√ßois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when the Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius calls the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance over all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the columns of the World in a few weeks' time, on the one hand, the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand, a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that enables every citizen to have an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in the eyes of American power, this is an important enlightenment.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any case to make us angry with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of U.S. collaboration?
The establishment of highly powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States have, in particular, established cooperation procedures and exchange of information almost daily, which are described on the one hand and on the other as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French by means of NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, on the other hand - it has already been said quickly - the Americans can provide information to the French on other regions of the world.
Thus, the substantive question behind this NSA case is not as much the ability or the right of countries to provide interception tools as the question of the total lack of prior debate, particularly in Parliament, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and finally the issue of conflict with freedoms.
What do the United States really risk? a degradation of their image?
It's nice to tell them, I don't see how they'll be punished.
The risk posed by the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have developed.
Another effect can be more economic: more and more European or South American companies refuse, in the light of the revelations, to provide their confidential data to US providers under American law, and thus to the NSA.
Last but not least: the vast movement of revelations undertaken by the media around the world, which helps to engage a debate on the monitoring practices of information services until almost non-existent, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their information services.
Intersex parents can choose "unspecified sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be attributed to them in a rigid way to their birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report the sex of their child, allowing them to register an "unspecified" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding a sexual re-assignment surgery for their infants and to combat discrimination against the intersexed persons.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that doctors have created, confused and embellished.
It is estimated that a child of 2,000 is born every year, not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, the intersexuality of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorder, a generic term that designates people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testiculars) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best information available to assign it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a sexual identification specialist, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea".
Intersexed children have an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case with most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
Science that is about how a child develops a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the intersexed persons as different from transgender or transgender persons, as their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, pylosity, chest and stamina), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexed and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conformity now have special destinations.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after having won his trial in appeal that allows him to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F ‚Äì X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In France, gender issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from that country's land Catholic signed a petition for the "theory of genders" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that "since the world is drawn into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex," she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And hardly a decade ago, the medical community considered the kind of a hardcore, which can be wiped out and over which to be redesigned.
But now there are many who challenge the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can cheat, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual re-assignation when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with complex sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, from Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malnourished.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals ‚Äì the way parents raise a child ‚Äì interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it would be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/John", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut during a bacle circumcision to make him castrated completely, by also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about the age of 15, he returned a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors ‚Äúalways repeat this model. ‚Äù
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who have survived these sex-change operations say "they are not satisfied with the result".
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but with ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical ablation from the external organ and testiculars and was raised as a daughter.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he had a vaginal disease.
But depressed and realizing that something was not going on, he asked for his medical records.
What he discovered has horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth ‚Äì and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, a man returned after a treatment with testosterone and his breast was removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-general of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "is inviting labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an "unspecified" sex," she said.
We are afraid that she will encourage the interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the name of the third sex."
"Adolescents should be able to make their own decisions about a legal nature," she added.
The German Act deals with the attribute of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammographies in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law would "responsibly" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called complete insensitivity syndrome for androgens.
Due to the failure of her androgens receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but she doesn't have uterine or ovaries.
Today 29 years of age, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or mobile mothers.
"The law leaves some flexibility to parents so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a period before entering "male" or "female".
So it's all right ‚Äì you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what they need," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels more comfortable ‚Äì and that is something terrible.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Leta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and the right within the coalition to power in the approach of the Senate's vote to reject Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the left-wing leader said that he "strongly intended" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The High Chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council condemned for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than partisans, declares his resignation.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL), Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated last October by his refusal to surrender to the Inquisitions of Berlusconi, who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the US Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fire blows.
Firefighters called on the scene have claimed to have responded to a call that states "multiple injured".
"The forces of the order are in place," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television images show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a rifle," said AFP a spokesperson for the US Transport Safety Agency (TSA).
The ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a branch card, and a second transport on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9.30 locals (12:30 in Montr√©al) at Terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
The Israeli army kills a member of the Hamas in Gaza-Sces
Israeli car shots killed an Islamic Palestinian militant of Hamas on Thursday and severely injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, learned from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your shootings of Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army was pleased to address a "targeted action" in the area near a qualified tunnel of "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, which was crossed the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be leaving Biden to fall for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book to appear and reported on Thursday night that the president's close collaborators had carried out "deep work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's escape could help Obama in his re-election while his hopes diminished.
According to the political correspondent of Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the impact of the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary of State of Clinton on the poll.
The possibility of a trade is a secret that has been furthest kept in the Chicago campaign QG and inside the oval office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president ‚Äì including Daley, the former leader of Obama's campaign Jim Messina and the former advisors to the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe ‚Äì knew that the change was under study.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley has carried out the task of replacing Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "would not significantly improve Obama's chances of success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said that I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley said in the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, so we were told, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified as a "concerned" review, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would benefit from the vote.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they're serious about taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know if Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of any change.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the president "was aware" of any change, the former secretary-general admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had so far.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not respond definitively to the question of whether the political surveys had come to Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's escape from the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
You want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous collation.
He had this idea after reading a study on the meds and convinced Chinese scientists to re-create the brilliant protein chemically.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to sing when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more milk we drink, the more it becomes bright.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about ¬£200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth heats the protein, the pH increases and the ice becomes bright.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives a brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the light of the medus is worth four times more than gold.
So every ball costs me about ¬£ 140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach society, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice. "
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
The ice uses fluorescent properties of the medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Thai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing Thai chi exercises on Thursday, his wife, Laurie Anderson, revealed in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" to the inhabitants of the town of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, watching the trees and performing the famous 21st Thai chi movement, with his hands as a musician who blew the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was the master of the chi, a Chinese martial arts.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband the week before her death to get her out of the hospital and take her to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had," she added.
Lou Reed had a liver scratch last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and enjoy going to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pinger.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed one candy and I'm certainly not going to do it any more this year.
But the cities show that I'm the galloping sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans ‚Äì 158 million in fact ‚Äì will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, decorations and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is trends.
The disbursements should represent $1.2 billion over the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the The Walking Dead TV series, and I bet the men of Dapht Punk's space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after discounts are zombies, Batman, pirates and sorceries.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
We did our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million in animal waste this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't get glamoured.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion in candy this year, according to the Nielsen firm.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we don't tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize beans are the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn seeds.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than used houses.
They carry the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million of revenue, according to the Americana Haunts, and this includes these amazing photos of you as you are pissing on yourself that your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which a type you love very much leaves a comment of the style "beautiful head".
Finally, let's talk about lemons.
Charlie Brown showed us La Grosse Citroille when we were boys, and sculpting a lemon in the form of a lantern, it's like decorating a Christmas tree ‚Äì it's something we've been doing since we've been little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby-citrollium trend" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potions and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, the Americans will spend around $106 million in citrolliums, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The latent citrolysis that fluttered gently on your house's porch was probably from Illinois, where 542 million citrolysis was cultivated this year.
If you are trying to make you notice more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg citrolyte.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal deficit structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion books (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relationship with London and accelerate its privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the share of the assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleared it in the next three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for depreciating the suspicious additional claims of four to 4.5 billion books per quarter, a writing related to the establishment of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up from 10 to 11 billion books of capital, thus strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a deal on the past, and the government, in particular, had been accused of taking part in the management of the RBS.
"We can now move forward, we worry about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a large bank for the clientele and the UK," said the new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces his sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has six-point boutique seats and hair belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General of Bowler Motorsport said: "The rally lovers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and real access to international events.
We are very happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the United Kingdom and the international, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of raiding rallying.
We were very pleased to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle ‚Äì the championship will really be striking.‚Äù
In addition, Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The firefighters were called to rescue a lost cock after being stuck 15 m above ground on an unstable corner in a career
Ruby, a cocker's spaghetti, had escaped after an accident of the road without gravity
It was recorded three days later by a person walking his dog stuck in the career
The firefighters came down in memory along the cliff to recover the dog and save her from a certain death
A rocket had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to recover it safely while it was lost 15 meters above the ground on the unstable floor of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old gambler, escaped after an accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for only three days before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to the Flappit career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They desperately sought their lost dog and launched a call on social networks sites after it disappeared in the career following an accident without gravity.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a man with a keen view of his dog noticed Ruby on a corner in the career, 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton firehouse went to the places and came down in memory to save Ruby using a animal caviar to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue specialist, said: ‚ÄúShe was in a precarious situation.‚Äù
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She certainly did not move during the rescue ‚Äì she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
The technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a lot of chance of getting out of it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted at the veterinarian for a check; her general condition was satisfactory, except for dehydration and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing to have it back in my arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had been evaporated, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were hot.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely awesome.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid that she would fall, but she did not move."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger said he never loved Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was choristic about Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He loved me when I was 18 years old."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger said he "did not categorically make any progress in Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses it with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing Causes a Turkmen Islamic Movement
"Turkey attack support came from the Central and West-based East-Turkey Movement," said the Chinese security authorities' boss at a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party Political Office (PCC), spoke at Tachkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official designates a special organization after Monday's assassination.
According to the Chinese police, three Oighours of the same family of the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their fuel-boiled car against the entry of the prohibited city in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of East Turkey, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives Scotland the choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are expected that an independent Scotland will have to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And here we hear passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbeled wires along the Hadrian wall.
If it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper has indicated the potential economic consequences of a greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not the case in the major titles (and that was to be expected).
No one has said that the EU Member States devote a large part of their time to cross their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for all it wants from the Scottish people.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: for the first time I heard the bobard that "independence means passport control" over 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty account.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels, especially now?
This is the real present for Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, the parties who oppose the EU or who fight for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency win from the ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and came from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes during the federal elections in September and came out of the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the Carcan heavy on national economies through its accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has nothing to do with national governments that record excessive budget deficits ‚Äì this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has put its members at the heart of the exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters ‚Äì what German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of assessing the national currency, the countries of South Europe face an intrinsic productivity problem for Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in public wages and expenses ‚Äì encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels ‚Äì which is a reason for subsidizing French and German companies in the energy sector at consumer costs ‚Äì the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-reduction problem, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage freezes will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by a good-market US ski lift gas.
As a result, the Great Revolution, in particular in France, is one of the major players in the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a way to control Germany and put Paris on a footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to drift away.
Result: the extreme right-wing party of Marine Le Pen, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, returning the Socialists to power in the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffrage ‚Äì an appropriate warning for the British Labour Party, which reminds him that it cannot depart from the principle that a right-hand split will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use European elections next year to create a single anti-monetary and anti-European bloc within the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties are good at these elections, which is very possible, such a block could be controlled by the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the single anti-European and anti-money sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more similar to the free Europe of the Nations (superior) privilege of the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could preserve the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I look forward to the United Kingdom taking its distance from this project, and I hope that it will take a gentle look at the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left on its own in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more freer European agreement if we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Nations Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is ‚Äì and it is worth noting ‚Äì the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the labor force, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democratic coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Older early
Studies show that young Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in family and health issues in the child.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's boobs and hairs start to grow to 7 or 8 years old?
During the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents ‚Äì generally this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kalowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as boaring the breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body smells, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and a half years, while it was 12 years and three quarters in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "early puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops ‚Äì something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in the adult age.
The recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the rate of emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications but recognizes that ‚Äúthe control of puberty can mitigate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others‚Äù.
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first ten-year-old rules.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from school and was upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories of public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages transported by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, get their puberty sooner.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study conducted on girls 6-9 years of age who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger Pubian area, the trend towards a true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among infants and grandchildren.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally respond well.
Girls whose puberty is early must be assured that, even if this happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Honoring the People of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by Coen brothers, the Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and popular music that began to resonate, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just become the subject of a retrospective to the French Cinematics, had picked up the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unable to hire Dylan or the Trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their return on the star amount of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humourful film where music is a central character and the songs interpreted live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to a musician and singer of people who performed, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich rounds in "Gatsby The Beautiful" for less glowing clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the oath is due to the machine when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about one week the tribulations of a folk singer who doesn't get to see and get angry with the whole earth.
He accepts the replacements at the feet of the studios.
Without housing, he turns the sofas of his friends who still want to receive it.
Documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of nightmares, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a careerist but integrates, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen, coroned with his brother Joel from several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real characters of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before the Greenwich Village event, this New York district called to become "the epicenter of the estuary of folk music that would generate international stars" as written by journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes documentaries, dusty music label of 33T invented by an impeccable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafes where the singers were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a character play that passes through the film continuously: a magnificent red cat looking cracking, lucky companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "great in Tennessee, bathed by the blues and the country".
"My first musical lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary for "to be considered as good", "the gambling can also start someone's career", and "more and more today".
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses any compromises on his music, the star pop explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
G√©rard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He'll never know the word retired.
The phenomenon of the French edition, G√©rard de Villiers, died on Thursday at 83 years of age, was just published by his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dedicated it as "the author of spying novels who knew too much about it".
He then spent ten days in Afghanistan, the 198th and 199th operas of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved on this journey with a detachment.
And before Afghanistan, he was also assigned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, G√©rard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, would make sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 million and 150 million all confused countries," he made progress last March.
His Burmese chat on his knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of an apartment of the Foch Avenue in two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designing a pile of books on the bottom table between the bronzes or reported ivorians of the 130 Arpent√© countries to place their novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with a beneficial chest, carrying a gun or a gun.
Inside, its very serene height (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, aristocrat of Austria disbursed and CIA contractual agent to pay for the repair of the family castle, is launched at the gates of all the earth's wicked, communists of the 1970s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 1990s.
Each book has the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitical and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a dozen of violence and torture.
"I never thought I was a literary author," explained G√©rard de Villiers.
I think I'm like a counter that's written to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters of Albert London, who went on the spot and came back with real and long investigations".
SAS's father said "make a sort of geopolitical sheet".
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," G√©rard de Villiers added.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people I've known for some 20 or thirty years.
Suddenly, many of its SASs are often predictable: so, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several high officials, he had told the story in "The Road of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command center in this city, a berth of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Conspiracy of Cairo", a year before the assassination.
In October 2012, in Panique in Bamako, he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I'm not davin, I was defending G√©rard de Villiers, I'm just making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these travels in frequently troubled areas, he was installed for a month after his machine to write IBM to Marguerite dating from 1976 "of which all the parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in the style.
At the walls of his office are reinforced with AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and pictures of the author with African warlords.
G√©rard de Villiers, who was regularly harassed by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I'm always welcome in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
G√©rard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die and he won't retire.
Not more than me.
Airplanes are interested in the width of seats while large commands are in play
The dispute rages among the major aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-distance flights, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the Dubai aeronautics lounge that takes place this month.
The conflict covers the width of the seats proposed on long-distance flights to the passengers of the economic class ‚Äì which are not always the shortest by airlines, but to which space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its major American rival Boeing states that it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted while the aircraft were seeking to sell even larger versions of their bi-engine long-distance aircraft, possibly waiting for a record of commands during the event that would take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which seats will be available at the rear of the plane ‚Äì in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats ‚Äì is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its refurbished "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 persons in economic class in 18 inches wide in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange punches on technical issues by making advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Aeronautic Salon, where 777X should take action on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the finance of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept it?".
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in closer seats than in regional turbopropulsors," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The size of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival adheres to a seating concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circuit of the newly baptized "get set" device was closer.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicates that an additional drop in the width of the seats would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing answers the Airbus figures regarding the width of seats and claims that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that cabin experience does not depend only on the width of the seats.
"It is really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they should do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to aircraft orders for an estimated market price of at least 700 Md in the coming decades, enough to balance US and European exports.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what feeds the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a seat performance in their latest models of long-distance bi-engines 20 % higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends partly on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this in order to be able to break down more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Kenston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins set up with 10 seats per row in the 777 existing ones suggest that many passengers speak in favour of a more dense configuration, which can be paired with lower rates.
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said the expert inside Mary Kirby cabins, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a supplier catalogue of which airlines must choose.
Air vendors who make the world's tour even carry a meter with them to check the competitive configurations.
While offering comfortable appliances, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it hasn't sold it yet.
Up until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only major manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say that it is unlikely that his appeal to the aeronautical industry will set up a size standard for the seats to be completed, but that it could make it forget the 777X sales gap.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it has slowed down the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just aureolated from the victory of his ship at the American Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that it co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had voted negatively on his remuneration.
Oracle's employer has given up a $1.2 million bonus for the fiscal year 2013 ended in May because of the group's poor performance, which failed to achieve its growth goals, but has found about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire period of the decline in 2013 the net profit of Oracle increased by 3.5 per cent, while the profit of Boddi Stock Exchange by 27.5 per cent, exceeding the S&P-500 index that took 24 per cent at the same time.
The new anti-nicotinic vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice alive from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before testing on the human being begins, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodys trace all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having its dose of nicotine.
In tests, the vaccineed mice to which nicotine was then given continued their normal activity.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were passionate", the researchers said, sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines were ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so often that levels of antibodies remained high that they were too expensive and little practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human-use vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tried to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotinic vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but reported that much more thorough research was needed.
The leader of Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a hit by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But those responsible for the intelligence, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, which was carried out in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The Watchman, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, moving to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with Tehran and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi is not influenced by Obeid
The former New Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi refused to change the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out if Mr. Obeid had pressured several government ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids had two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without any call for tenders.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Assistant Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the government pressured the banks to make bids.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which related to Obeid approximately $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Ports of February 2006 to November 2009, was in favour of tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, demanded a change in government policy in the field of bribery.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICAO showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports Department after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of commercial leases policy?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely asked Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but in any case, it wasn't.
In any case, it certainly is not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, states a responsible
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, confirming a military officer in Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said that there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian production missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel had air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass a "authentic" test
The Government is currently studying the possibility of establishing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa of 457 while considering extending the measures of repression.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent the 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified posts or as a diversional means to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was released today, while Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying he could offend the neighbours of Australia.
"The failing statements about "foreigners returning to the end of the file" and "Employment for the Australians first" are a distasteful return to the time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected ‚Äì and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working paper refers to the 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to see "if the job offer is authentic in the case of a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the company sponsoring it".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum applicant would die of a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The prodigal son of the man, 9 years old, had come to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died on Wednesday at an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study designed to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opening in 2026.
The Minister of Transport Kramer stated that the project would "assemble the United Kingdom".
The Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown called himself "excite" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will bring on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England, from ¬£32.6 billion to ¬£42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of the journeys to the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of a three-hour trip between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Baronne Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is to build a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it offers are huge.
Without it, we are facing a capacity problem of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support "no doubt" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Great Britain.
"We are therefore excited about working in partnership with the British government in order to examine the options for bringing the train network to Scotland at high speed, creating an advantage for all and complementing the line Glasgow-Edimburg that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I am eager to read the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide all the next steps."
The rules on the use of on-board electronic devices remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to extend their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States gesture to ease regulation on electronic devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft".
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it painful not to be able to access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision that forces American carriers to do an important job to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the ad but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is the subject of a regulation that obliges aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of permanent safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who had already spoken to CASA of her intention to extend her use of on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but stated that she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Quantas stated that she was in compliance with the current rules for the time being.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the decision of the FAA and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interferences from electronic devices, as well as review the manuals, training equipment, hand luggage delivery programs and instructions provided to passengers.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to remove their equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment be placed safely under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent baccarare
The small town of Pia has experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a group of thirty people according to the evidence collected...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia, where a race involving several people broke out on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injuries would be to be regretted.
Alertly, the gendarmes have gone into place to separate the wounded and to ensure that the wounded are taken care of.
Singapore's gambling lenders benefit from the average classes forced to close the belt
Janani Amirthalinga holds a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold ear loops to pay for the school fees for her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is gone," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, she says, the monthly family income is not enough.
In fact, the application is such in some parts of Southeast Asia ‚Äì where the debt of households is increasing ‚Äì that ValueMax, where it has done its transaction, became the third loan company in charge this week to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Spending jewelry is not only a quick way to obtain cash ‚Äì $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga ‚Äì but it is almost as good a market as non-guaranteed bank loans.
As a general rule, Singapore's loan holders receive an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same business centre.
However, bank lenders have the advantage of not asking for a check of solvency or wage evidence, and they can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to debt lenders, while families feel the pressure to increase the cost of living and overhauling households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market credit provided by a monetary policy too laxistic in advanced economies, low-income and middle-income families turn to bankers to cover the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the growing debt of households, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore were registering the high-end ratio of households/gross domestic products in Asia.
Malaysia ranks at 80% of GDP, while this rate rose to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also afraid of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which came out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with the increase in costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [of the salary scale] are trying to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high gold prices over the past two years have forced people to pay for their personal effects to touch the value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items in the 200 loan shops in the city are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's spend the gold chain of grandmother and we'll be looking for it again next month."
In Thailand, easyMoney, the largest bank loan operator, has recorded an increase of 20% of customers using its banks over the past few months.
The increase is as high in the stock loan sector as ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer store and of 15 other shops as well as in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighboring Malaysia ‚Äì where it already has four shops ‚Äì but also outside Asia, says Yea Lee Ching, its Director General.
The company will finance them by using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week at its introduction to Singapore's stock exchange.
While some low-rate borrowers have put off criticism of the exorbitant interest rates that they practice, Ms. Yeah points out that not only does it offer lower rates than other borrowers, but it does not increase the debt directly.
"Customers mortgage assets that they already own, and currencyizing their personal property does not increase the debt of households," she said.
Spending is better and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining a guaranteed short-term funding.
People who go to the banks are not only those who have financial problems.
The easy people from Singapore also go to the ValueMax loan shops to charge gold lingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase prices.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It can be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who have cash needs to go through a difficult puzzle," adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax region in Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following his searches at his home and at the Office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor was an official, was deeply attested by this news.
In a communiqu√©, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
It will be compared in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He becomes a Nazi uniform at the supermarket, before being kicked off
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform with a brewed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the head of the establishment that called the police, said the shop Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time it arrived, it was already gone without hesitation," she added.
I was making a tail when I saw a woman who seemed to be upset.
People were good-mouthed.
"You don't go out in the street like this unless you want to draw attention," said one customer, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, in Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it's customary to take off in a monster, but it was hard to know if it was a canal.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS brassard twice a week at Asda for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems".
Rescue plan of $325 million for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the 325M rescue plan for the vacillation health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government does not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking urgent measures to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
Funding, planned for over four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will solve the unique difficulties facing the State," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for emergency surgery.
2 600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up with the delay.
Funds are also provided for clinics without meeting in Hobart and Lanceston, with better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to care for the Tasmanian health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister said that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain the current funding levels in order to receive the Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million would not count for anything "unless they were followed by a real reform to consolidate the Tasmanian public health system".
However, he commended the Government for responding to the urgent request for assistance submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing the public health system from the black list of Tasmania," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these non-emergency extra procedures will in large part reverse the recent coups.
But Peter Dutton's health opposition spokesman thinks today's announcement is a "a solution of fortune".
"The reason why we are here is that the state laborist government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
There can be no government of the state that can raise almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and pretends it's a long day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollars in the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is marked by a remarkable artistic direction and a minute reconstruction of time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
She was in France in the 1760s, telling the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces cruelty without the support of a Supremacy Mother deliberately sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never puts itself in lubricants or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
Consciousness of the story could also become a prison sentence for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says the monitoring agency
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Agency on Thursday, while violent confrontations raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also stated Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived with a day ahead of the deadline for the
1 November, established by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including maturated gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, opens a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Great Britain.
The group of militants, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of Syrian-based militants, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were dead.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces found death, 18 678 of which were pro-government forces fighters and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition combatants, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
The troops of El Assad are fighting the rebels, many of whom are linked to groups of the Al-Qaida network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not specify.
The fights highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they were due to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that is going to end in close times.
A statement by the OIAC, working in close cooperation with the United Nations, indicated that its team was now "satisfied with having controlled ‚Äì and destroyed ‚Äì all the critical production declared and the machines for mixing and filling".
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned for the time being."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first phase of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors reported.
On Thursday, the IOC said that both sites were, according to Syria, "refused and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OIAC inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a total plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the OIC Executive Committee the following month.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmet Uzumcu's Director General in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels in the government of El Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alauites sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence pronounced against one of Bali's bomb holders
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the attacks of Bali in 2002 reacted furiously to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be executed, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years running as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the manufacture of explosives used in the attacks.
It could be released at the end of 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for attacks targeting two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many injuries.
It was also found guilty of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia in the wake of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors have asked for a permanent detention penalty, but they could have asked that the man, qualified as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision dismissed the painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two twins 39 years old, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction of Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the side of the tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be dragged to the execution platoon," Ms. Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other children, not seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in an outdoor van, exploded just after 23.00 a.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze jumped a back bag with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He went into the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while he was in respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should have known the same way as the other three members of Jemah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage ‚Äì Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra ‚Äì who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, therefore, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bomb posers to be translated into justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaida, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that reports of intelligence services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore ties between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't go," Mrs. Corteen added.
Until recently, he had been laughing at the sadness he had caused to others.
The verdict was brought to the attention of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be held later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal for his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but don't call with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music ‚Äì but not to talk on their mobile phone ‚Äì under the new very expected directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be introduced will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft complies with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules on the installation of equipment for compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies that have already submitted plans.
"On the basis of the plan, we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA stated in a statement.
Currently, passengers must spread their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not supposed to be lit before the aircraft reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to remove their aircraft when the aircraft is landing before landing and do not light them up until the aircraft is placed.
Under the new guidelines, air carriers whose aeroplanes are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and ground operation, the FAA said.
Most of the new line and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Waiting, said happy about these changes.
"When the new policy is implemented safely ‚Äì and we will work closely with the carriers for this ‚Äì it will benefit everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are extremely tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices in order.
So not always from Words With Friends, the Srabble-style online game that Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was kicked out loud from an American Airlines plane after refusing to extend his device while the device was locked at the door.
And the heavier devices like portable computers will always have to be sorted because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
On-board mobile phones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to be at risk.
"The mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone antennas if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to discuss the problem recommended last month that the government authorize wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased over the last few years to alleviate the restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no reason for security for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extend their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New line planes depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.
Air carriers have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified planes to host Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio power transmissions much lower than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, only emit minimum transmissions when a page is turned.
But the transmissions are stronger when the telescopic devices or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who pressure to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders loaded a plane from Kindle's electronic bookreaders and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there was no one.
This has inspired members of the FAO Advisory Committee on Mitigated Feelings on whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers stated that he thought interference from devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA authorize pilots to request passengers to extend their equipment during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed changes, calling them full-fledged arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird from a North Sea platform has been released in nature
A bird, helicopterd after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil platform, was released in nature.
The water line was mounted on board a helicopter headed by Aberdeen last month before it was put on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue centre of Alloa.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This river of water was probably a winter migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added: "It was impossible to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and to define what wealth and jobs creators want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive investigation of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, generally representing all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now seeking export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to join in the long and hard process of reforming European institutional arches.
When asked for their opinion on specific political issues ‚Äì ranging from monopolies to product laws ‚Äì the majority of business leaders feel that controlling these key competences should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has caused general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate compared to the benefits of the European area of trade ‚Äì 40% of the major companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agreed.
Finally, and more importantly, our investigation with business leaders revealed that an important majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a "significant change" that gives power to the United Kingdom.
Issues are high ‚Äì changing the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would allow for a 16% ballot of votes in favour of the country's maintenance in the EU at a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt one moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies expect renegotiation to be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is engaged in a closer economic and tax union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our investigation show, for businesses this means re-emphasizing trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
United States of America with Halloween colours
In the United States, President Obama did not give up the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, yesterday night, he distributed a few friends to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivals on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passing of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, therefore, the feasts have fallen apart.
In New York, thousands of people customarily participated in the parade organized in the neighborhood of Greenwich Village.
Everyone is excited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the suit that I had planned last year.
We play like fools, add Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated in the wake of the Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom says Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Gazprom Director.
"A historic event took place today: The construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest-scale project in Europe," explained Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, in a Thursday statement.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream should diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart from Ukraine, a country through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe is transiting, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that direct accession to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries below by the end of the year.
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday daily The Tahitian News, which includes information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutinies of Bunty, an episode of the history of the English Navy, which led to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bunty mutants, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which corresponds to its exclusive economic area.
A deputy to the Mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanitize these 836,000 km2, provided that it has the means to ensure its surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to zone surveillance, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEA, neighbor to Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former vice-president of Jilin Province, north-east of China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Except for the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million pot-vin yuans, reports the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first interim court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the head of state has promised that justice would be as intrusive with the powerful "tigers" as with the "mouses" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, including former oil giant Petrochina's leaders.
The recent most spectacular case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having targeted the highest positions in the state.
However, the government has not shown any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent body of the party.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing by the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of New South Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse against Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, YMCA stated that it had "never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization".
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, a counsellor with the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA was inaccurate by stressing that "the external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the worst second evaluations on four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they had to report any violations of the child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings to the safety of children.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, that he had them sitting on his knees, that he loved them and that he had let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said that she was responsible for the services at the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who was going to bring Lord ‚Äúvery intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time‚Äù.
The Director-General said that he rejected the testimony of staff that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their superior hierarchy.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord had clouded their judgment, which made them not to report their actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his view in front of the Board of the YMCA of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson learned from "the incident of Jonathan Lord" should not concern "the signal" by staff, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to make confidentiality agreements staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the Chief Executive Officer of the YMCA in charge of child services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "exceeding of zeal" and that it had been misappropriated.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the Commission.
He noted that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return Prime Minister, but he admits that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of its departure at the end of its mandate, 59-year-old man expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments on foreign affairs and his special role as Quartet in the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to find the Prime Minister's position, Mr. Blair would have replied, according to the London Standard Evening: "Yes, of course, but it can probably happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events gathered at Cardiff to face and win the Cheval Trophy of the year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But nobody expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the small and his pony Shetland Toffee were defeated during the three rounds with a great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind them the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable ‚Äì which are of the same size ‚Äì were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his plate helmet a little on the side untraceably to show his poniey Toffee 2 years old around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his natural qualities of little common dress for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for her 3rd anniversary last March and has been in contact with her pony Shetland every day.
His mother, Donna, 30 years old, said, ‚ÄúFenton and Toffee make a great duo. ‚Äù
They came up against and against everyone, but they both pulled the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were unhappy with the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This young boy, from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air, and everyone encouraged it and praised it."
He traveled all the length of the track running and even if he seemed to be all small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is mad with animals ‚Äì he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he began, he will certainly be involved in the manifestation of the Year's Horse ‚Äì and I am sure he will do a good performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they showed up on the track.
They are looking for an effective team work between the pony and the trainer ‚Äì Fenton and Toffee have been the best on the track.
I'm sure his pretty clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of it.
A Chinese journal that launched a "remote" call
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of an accused of defamation journalist will be remedied, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted to television that he had accepted wine pots to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will go up a "full replacement," the regulator said.
The order of "recast" comes from the administration of Guangdon for the Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the company Zoomlion listed between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The New Express drafting was unorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided to "impose an administrative sanction to Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "commanded the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete replacement of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the persons responsible for New Express and immediately regroup the management team of the newspaper."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his journal published a first-page appeal for his release twice, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories against money.
"In this case, I have hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's excuses, New Express published his excuses on the first page, writing that he had not checked his articles correctly.
Several important suspects recently made television glasses.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their ears, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft port in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft is on fire.
The radioactive steam escape detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear fuels in mid-October and while the ship was at sea was "without danger to the marines", but it is not without consequence to the Marine.
In fact, the Royale has just confirmed the "unavailability" of the ship until the mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are needed" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DNCS company, a specialist in the defence ship, ensures that its teams and those in Areva, which are deployed in the Var for the occasion, are "currently involved on the aircraft".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the defective fuel.
"Everything is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013, however, explains the DCNS.
And the National Navy's certifying that "it doesn't bring the ship's activity program into question" to nuclear propulsion.
Let us remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft is out of a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He'd been on Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is, in particular, for the purpose of qualifying young hunting pilots.
A "small accident", which is limited to the reactor's containment space, was then produced on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to find a lot of discontent on the part of the people I meet: a monstrous reassessment of their properties, a discharge of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to no longer finish them.
Brief, unlimited syphony from our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be spared in order to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money removed from the taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their reduction.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, there is no doubt about the sumptuous spending and the maintenance of housing canaries: a poor cultural centre, a strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, either they are sold to the private company or they are demolished.
It is also hard to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention of the transformation of former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but what is the cost for taxpayers?
It is not for the public to invest in such companies, but for the private sector on the basis of the consumer's request.
Citizens were pleased to learn that lakes in the Fish and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the start of all industries (large water consumers) and the major decline in the population, the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the country.
Without saying to waste it, the city will never lack water, and the heavy regulation on its use could be very well-adjusted.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is not even able to buy a style without going through a loan settlement.
We've been managed for over 40 years by ties with beautiful diplomas for most people and I don't think a sheep lift gets worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway route
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The American authorities described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they've ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagan on an equivalent length of nearly six long football grounds, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, the United States.
The area has indefinable storage facilities, which allows easy to dissipate drug-loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were responsible by going unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to the court case.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine for sale.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traders operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth major crossing in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following the harvest of marijuana in the center of Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that was part of the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
The British Police issues an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against 40-year-old Australia, asking him to introduce himself to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible ways under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he filed against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm authorized his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London on 19 June, requesting that South American country to have political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to present himself to a police station, on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
It continues to breach the conditions of its release under bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issue of the notice by the police.
He was afraid of being expelled from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after exposing more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks' website against classified information.
How biometrics invaded our lives
Finish the password to tap to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a transversal and transnational universe as well as the Internet .
Organisations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this commitment to biometry, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 and France, the National Commission on Computerism and Freedoms has authorized 774 systems for the recognition of prints, hand form or hand network in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, wherever and whenever," said Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, one at a time, one at a time, and one at a time?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques that will allow new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are the digital prints, the hand contour and the surrounding network of the palm or finger.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work on concrete have very low fingers and their prints are inaccessible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the field of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the neighbouring network and the surrounding of the hand, is a voluntary and specific gesture of people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data at their insuu - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the coloured part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased precision of the sensors and the calculation capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten in the last five years, calculated by Cyril Bataller, director of the accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or an iris in motion.
"Today, we conduct research on the recognition of voice or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridar Iyingar, director of Intel Labs Security Research.
A unique and unforgivable marker, DNA is also a source of hope and concern.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the last biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Perspective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a voucher of EUR 90,000 to analyse DNA samples at the scene of a crime and within an hour.
The use of biometrics is divided into two groups: identification (recognise a person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is what it claims to be).
The identification concerned the issue of identity papers so far: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information the state has on all citizens already posted.
This ensures that a person does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We will recover the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible for commercial development at NEC France for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a photo of a person who makes the tail in a store, follow his progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical access (frontiers, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the peer that points to another," explains Cyril Bataller, of Accenture.
But more and more, authentication will also cover transactions, in particular those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by entering his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the fall of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoul√™me by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and teachers of the large distribution: when paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at the French traders.
Tracks to assure users
There are three ways to make biometric seductive in the eyes of the general public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometry, a client remains in cash for 30 seconds less, it is appreciated," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you options in measure.
Finally, reassure by putting in mind the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The digital prints are stored on a first server; the identities of people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
However, due to in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Personal life protection specialists, they, they, continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa makes me afraid of the worst: widespread surveillance," says Andrew Patrick, of the Canadian Privacy Commissioner.
A 210 km/h wheeled driver with a hot drink between his legs was struck with a fine of ¬£1,000.
A car driver saw a fine of ¬£1,000 to have rolled 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was detected driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to carry between his legs.
In the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his permit led to a six-month withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a fee of ¬£90 and an extra charge for a victim of ¬£100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally numbered the capital gains tax measure, but expects a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has recorded a 7% stamp right for properties that cost more than ¬£2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties in a company rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp right is already applicable to the residential properties of the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents ¬£708 over the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West and the assembled Yorkshire and Humber region.
Mr. Cook said: "As a result of the increase in the right to stamp on high-value property and the introduction of anti-avoidance law, it is very difficult to advance that high-value property is subject to the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors resistant to the idea of buying properties in London or the current owners resistant to the idea of selling," he added.
The real estate ‚Äì the 5% to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market ‚Äì in the prosperous sector located in southwestern London, which spread from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by 11.8% in the last year.
Prices in the centre of London show regular annual growth of 5.6 % but have been driven by a "internal market" in full growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a resumption, according to Savillas' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its humour.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs removed their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nerve dogs removed it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that, in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that, as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about the way dogs react to other dogs' deranged tail movements, researchers have followed animals by watching movies where other dogs were.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will certainly not take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs of the movies where other dogs ‚Äì either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion ‚Äì and we have been able to smuggle the movement of the tail and present it as going further to the left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression remove the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they saw a tail turn mainly to the left (once again from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they had anxious air.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you encounter several other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react on the basis of this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, who was invited to the School of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol University, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his tail turned left rather than right instead of becoming anxious ‚Äì the reverse of what is in the Italian study."
He pointed out that the differences could result from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified ‚Äì and dogs do not make an exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail moves sometimes on the one hand and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed to its singer.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to take place on Friday in the The Hydro concert room in the city center.
However, his laryngitis forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "After deciding to postpone the concert to the LG Arena de Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys also have to report the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that it cannot occur in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will be held on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all the ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact the customer service to the ticket where you bought your tickets for any additional help.
Pope Fran√ßois will nominate his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest men of the church in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Fran√ßois will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope ‚Äì this is why he returns to a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops would be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the constitution.
"The Pope Fran√ßois decided to communicate his decision to convene the constitution of February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholiques said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably have decreased.
He stated that a pope generally appointed so many cardinals that he needed it so that the number of cardinal electors would reach 120 and so many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
The constitution of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Fran√ßois in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a tendency to favour Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Fran√ßois formed the council of the cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to examine the ways of reforming the church.
Earlier, the pope decided on his own.
"Now Fran√ßois has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "all possible" that Fran√ßois asked for advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation ‚Äì it is completely new.
Valero indicated that the popes generally elected bishops from large communities to the cardinal rank, but that Fran√ßois was ‚Äúfull of surprises ‚Äì so we don‚Äôt know who he will name.‚Äù
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the headquarters file
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually inclined files, according to a Friday statement by the US vehicle safety regulation agency.
On some pickups, the previous seats could present a defect at the level of the tilt mechanism.
Consequently, the records do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not protect passengers properly, thus increasing the risk of injury," according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statement.
The models were built between August 1st and September 10th.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its failure and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the default pickups owners during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to examine the owner's information letter due to the end of 16 days of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra pickup sales, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% during the first 10 months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
The GM stock exchange rate rose by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies enlivened under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday before noon, in Montreal.
The drama took place about 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been done in this area for some time.
A mythical foundation wall has just been raised in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim just arrived on the site in order to recover his tools.
I was driving and I saw the wall crashing with a big smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the yard.
I'm off and I'm going to take out the big bricks that would cover it.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim was an old man in the 50s who worked for a boxing company.
Rehabilitation maneuvers were attempted by emergency services, but failed.
Man has not survived his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was deployed to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair of an Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He said Obama had made commendable efforts by the Republican Party's obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, or drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a book that's so sad these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's memories of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I was asleep, this book took me back to the time when the policies inspired millions of people and the speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with a stunning victory and news reporters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cried with joy and my parents kept all the papers they found.
A young visionary team headed toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the Obama transition period prior to its entry into service in 2008, it had 82% favourable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I imagined.
I place on Obama's credit great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, passing through the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the murder of Ussama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partial obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reform, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after many times defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can't provide any more explanations.
I'm on the side of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, or the prosecution of complainants who reveal the government's evils.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the avoidance of public finances and the overexpenditure authorized during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the House to reduce the media to silence are "more aggressive... since Nixon's administration".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I mentioned above appear to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and slightly refined alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or his positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had been meant to speak for so long.
However, while the index of favourable opinions dropped below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to get back to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses for Clinton's profit to the Principals of Pennsylvania.
At a follow-up meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place from Retinne Street in Fl√©ron.
The motorcycle, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fleuron, was not wearing helmets.
Despite the rapid intervention of reliefs, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system.
Billionaire Clive Palmer said Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The magnitude of the mining extraction, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, made this argument an effort to avoid issues related to a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mineral taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to benefit from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a change in the suffrage-depleting system to accelerate the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is completed?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 p.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it possible to delete the result if someone disagrees?
Today, having a pencil of paper seems amazing.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options for the electronic vote and recently published a joint discussion document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We do not seek reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of forest dolphin outside the northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, who is responsible for scientific mission at the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marines (OCEAMM) Observatory, returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of boxing dolphin surprise you?
It's good news, but I'm not surprised.
If, in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics will allow us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
Furthermore, it is not possible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to result in the classification or belonging of a species to a kind, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged because of the advances in genetics.
Similarly, two very closely morphologically close species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific dolphins and the Atlantic whales.
Recent analyses made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this a discovery of importance as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known by researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have a case of extinction of a species rather than of a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or by extinction depending on the number of individuals on Earth, that is, stock, and the possibility to recover from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species discovered has come out, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This bridging of genes limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more close ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, not to know what lives in the Mariannes pit, only 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent in life research on other planets than in marine research, and it's a long time that this changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the file, which shows that the global survey of regulators on the suspicions of foreign exchange manipulation begins to bear its fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the most important financial market investigations in the world, where $5.3 billion changes by hand every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the extension of the investigation, which has led to the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulators," said one bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources near the file reported that RBS had sent instant emails and messages sent to and by an old trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European trading officer to the accountant for the currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Trade Manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
The file of Mr. Usher included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had attempted an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities ‚Äì the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ‚Äì are examining allegations made concerning bankers that would be heard to manipulate rates on the exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Cr√©dit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicating sources close to the file.
Banks are using instant messages and emails sent over the years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News on these investigations has derailed traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment banks trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of highly liquid changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having a low-cost market impact".
The new came the very day when the Swiss Credit announced that a trader working in his office had been negotiating funds from the London Stock Exchange this week after he lost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation into Major Rob Ford has been carried out, supported by a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby said that he had never seen an investigation "so bad".
Ruby said to believe in the Canadian press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
This Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's occasional friend and driver Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of exorcising about the video.
Alexander Lisi, formerly accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said they had observed this guy delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby qualified as "inexplicable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, claiming that the chief of police Bill Blair chose to know why he did not act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have demanded an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police didn't comment, but his spokesperson Mark Pugash called Me Ruby's "clear and desperate attempt" to make use of the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European scholarships at mid-session, except for London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges evolve in a fall on Friday to mid-session, fuelled by some news from depressing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe that the US Federal Reserve could undermine its quantitative mitigation policy earlier than planned.
On the contrary, after an inflation rate of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could simplify its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street is precipitated by the opening up of US actions after two consecutive response sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest CAC 40 response, as a result of the warning of his partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also publishing down results this morning and announces the creation within a "bad bank" structure of 38 billion books of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the head of EuroFirst300 in response to press information that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the market for change, speculations on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy are going well, as evidenced by John Hardy, a strategy at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's unique mandate has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong drop in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its mission against the US currency and has reached a lower meeting of two weeks at $1.3517.
These same concepts in turn support the mandatory market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court validating the Obama Health Reform Act
Great victory for Obama's administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today stated that Obama's health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ‚Äì which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, with the penalty of having to pay a fine ‚Äì and stated that it was constitutional under the government's taxation authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Law of 2,700 pages and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that Medicaid should be reduced to a threshold of eligibility without losing all the federal funding of the programme, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates in the high-ranking presidential election during the early 2012 primary elections, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, were far-reachingly opposed to the law.
Vibrant respect given to former combatants in Menton
In the heart of Trabuquet's cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and the deaths of all wars on Friday afternoon.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by M.J. Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Crossing between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured Thursday, October 31, 2013 at night at a violent crossroads at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, November 1st after the exhausting of its fuel stocks, the Palestinian enclave's Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another framework of the Hamas army branch, Rabbi Barikeh, were killed by a car accident at an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel crossed by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli car and a armoured bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred metres within the territory before leaving.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqu√©, a spokesperson of Hamas, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heros" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the Heroes of Al-Qassam who fell in defense of the territory during an incursion into the Zionist occupation of Khan Younges.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," the spokesman threatened.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was at the outset a section of a large tunnel crossed into Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and targeted, according to the army, "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the purpose was to eliminate Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqu√©.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck a military base in north-west Syria, aimed at loading missiles for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday, October 31.
An American responsible confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he was pleased to add.
The Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information on such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it had not designated, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombing aimed at a load of ground-based missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn in an air defence base in Sonar Jabl√©, near Lattaki√©, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of militants and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies at Dance Dance: the first inspired by Henri Michaux's poems and poems, the second inflated by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
A evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, art to the ticks, and black ink to the white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, progresses, profile, finish like a line and black dress, a body.
On the screen, an encre of Henri Michaux is designed.
The body, just treats, takes its form.
And this form will be that of all the room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and the face discovered, wait on each side of the game area, hurry when the next graphics appear, incarnate it, emerge by running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in group at the unisson (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
It is thought of "Glorie of the morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of written choreographic tasks on posters, placed online at the front stage.
That's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, drumming and electric guitars.
Energy is high, speed is always fast.
There will be a crash when Carol Pray will take refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro in hand, without sovereignty or restraint, a part of Michal's poem, monocord and monotone in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if possible, ends by swallowing and swallowing.
As does the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashing - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - like these hairs that buoy or these black tissues that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It is felt that the choreographer, instead of going to the Michaux work meeting, was forced, with his ticks.
Result: the bodies look flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's encres, like Gestalt's forms, opens a broader and gibby imagery than dance, more porous.
Only the end, negatively, with its dancers touched by a stroboscope light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touched the magic.
The audience loved it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the contract, are richer.
The scene is partly made of grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers relax to play the scores.
Their impatience in music, touching, gives real weakness.
On the stage, the couples pass through, in loving dues, very sensual, even erotic.
Groupwork, small transition soils, groups that move, hearts, writing is less binary.
Buffons appear, also family members of Chouinard, with red nose, in very polarized male-female parades.
Loves are carnage, runners or players.
The gesture, laughter, and the small crissies beautifully convey the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in the coyote, of the beings that are founded.
But the room takes its real envelope after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the cabotine dancers descend among the spectators, shine, smoke, short-circuit, play code of applause, rip the sauce into a highly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
The joy and madness are inspiring, and it is the art of Chouinard, here, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nortel patents has launched an avalanche of court proceedings on Thursday's patents against mobile telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company he took to the pot when selling the patents that took place after Nortel's failure.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Northel patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the United States Court of Justice in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly held by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising in relation to terms of Internet research, have indicated the results of the trial, which is the heart of Google's business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which provides a strong competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally offer 4.4 Md$.
After losing Nortel patents in front of Rockstar, Google has subsequently purchased Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 MD, a partial market based on the Motorola Patent Library.
"Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents," the trial concluded.
Rockstar claims more damage and interests to Google because he claims that the violation of Google's patents is prevented, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: A Defective Water Warfare at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a housing in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a defective water heater, indicated on Friday evening the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert on the spot by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was designed by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying at his grandfather's and his companion's, was on his side and was burned more slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long-termly conditioned on the spot before being taken to the League CHU, she was in helicopter, in ambulance," said Mayor Jos√© Paulet, who came down to the places.
Traumatized, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Safe and except, he was able to join the ground floor by the ladder remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the landlord of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were dismissed by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police were involved.
The civil protection of Crisn√©e has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt requests the first freely elected President to lend an oath
Mohamed Morsi loaned the investment oath, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the investment oath to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Moubarak who was defeated 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi has also become the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore to the 18 black judges of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life ‚Äì absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer from the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and severely repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered before the Court to call the new president and, demarcating from the presidential record of the years of Moubarak, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy to the very frequent streets of the city centre to the south plains.
Considered as the little charismatic "wheel of relief" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been considerably strengthened since his victory and his speech on Friday during which he tried to present himself not only as the candidate of Islamists but all those who wanted to finish the work started in the 2011 uprising against President Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue and red tie suit, addressed to the judges present in the hall with an oath of peace.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national hymne while he was on guard.
Major Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand..." enchanted by thousands of people gathered in the university's great amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and the former foundation of secular education, Cairo University later became a fan of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, from which the uprising which ended the authoritarian regime of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of the military council, which replaced the former President-in-Office.
But by accepting to give an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he is inclined to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's talk on Tahrir was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the United States slowed the growth of the car market
The closure for 16 days in most federal administrations has weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published by the manufacturers on Friday, five of the main six achieved lower performances than expected.
The three major manufacturers of Detroit show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
The analysts predicted on average 15.4 million annual sales and adjusted seasonal changes, but the market was set at 15.3 million according to the estimates of Adam Jonas, an analyst for Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight break is primarily explained by "the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first fifteen months".
However, GM reported a progression of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from, among other things, the success of his pick-up, saw his sales progress from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
On his side, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to 143 536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also sell less than consensus, despite increases of 8.8% and 14.2%, respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM was 1.4% at 4:35 GMT while Ford was 1.1%.
Renault plummeted in Borse by the warning of Nissan
Renault accuses Friday the strongest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced a 20% reduction in its annual net profit forecast, reports traders.
Nissan, who had to make such a revision, also announced a change in his direction.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," said one responsible for trading a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from the Nissan website.
Greece: two deaths in a shooting near a site of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was severely injured on Friday night by fire blows fired by two people who were on board a motorcycle passing by a place of the Neonazi Aube party golden in the west coast of Athens, we learned from a police source.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Dore Aube's members had argued that the victims were guardians of their place.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service moved to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio Bay, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident took place a few weeks after the accusation of six Aub√©'s golden MPs, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in "a criminal organization" within the framework of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's call was rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two matches of the League of Champions of his club against Ajax and the Milan AC.
Kicked against Bar√ßa for a blow to Neymar, the Scottish environment saw its suspension extended to three UEFA meetings.
In a communiqu√©, his club was called "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15 042 subscribers to the black, Monter√©gie with 13 464 and the Outauauais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also knows its lot of breads with nearly 7,000 private houses of electricity in the metropolis and Laval.
You think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its net increase in profits and hopes for record results thanks to vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expected to realize a underlying benefit for the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million, against a previous estimate of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17 per cent of growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had achieved 8 per cent of the first semester's benefits and that the second semester had begun in force, in particular with regard to travels other than business trips in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are in a good way to achieve record results throughout the year before interest and tax deductions," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the most profitable countries.
In Australia, the leisure sector rebounded during the second half, which provided compensation for a domestic market for small business trips.
Also in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre leisure travel sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
His subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses during the first half of the year in which the seasonal demand was lower and was expected to benefit from the year as a whole for the third time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to reach $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown places on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown conjured people opened the fire this Friday at a hotel near Cairo pyramids in Egypt without victims, as a result of a querelle appearance with licensed employees.
The attackers took the escape, specified the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt no longer receives any tourists since the army has replaced Islamic President Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses in the blood the demonstrations of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, orthograph and grammar
In the course of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to our day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow ‚Äì the first materials to undergo a radical review.
It will make changes in other fundamentals next year.
Furthermore, the Board of Regulators will, of course, open up a change in the structure of the GCSEs, with a new rating system and less training.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence", stressing that GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students make about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the GCSE of deep maths ‚Äì as well as the greater importance given to the materials contained in international classifications ‚Äì would probably encourage schools to provide more hours of training.
The programme will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State, which puts the right to abortion far into question, will be able to enter into force.
An octogenary welcomes children with a gun at the Muy for Halloween
The 9 and 13-year-old minors made the door to the door to claim candy at Halloween night.
One of the banks of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86 years of age, explained to the gendarmies that he was afraid.
His weapon was captured.
The ex-chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
M√ºller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his mark, was actually buried in a common pit of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, said the German Resistance Memorial leader, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
M√ºller didn't survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he assured the daily high-drawing, based on records.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great Enigmas of Postwar.
The German secret services, the BND, would also ensure that during the summer of 1949, M√ºller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"Since August 1945, M√ºller's body has been found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the Reich Aviation by a commando," said Mr. Tuchel.
He wore "a general uniform."
"In the left inner pocket there were, in particular, its service statements with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district mayor of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the district's Jewish cemetery.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal Nazi Sadducees is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormous amount of bad taste.
"A large crowd of the victim's memory of the foot," he got in the newspaper.
Heinrich M√ºller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He participated in the Wansee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and in particular under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, only 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the election of "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father to alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and to go to hospitals that were not equipped to come to his aid.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaound√©, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken it abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent many years accompanying his father in closed clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could receive.
"It's not easy," added Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, go to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they've waited too long.
The situation hasn't changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 physician for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonis could not pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so much of his compatriots suffering, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed over 700 surgeries free of charge during the last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaound√©.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which takes place in rural areas during the weeks to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost all Fridays, with thirty people, they get into vans after they have fixed the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
They're not always followed by chance.
They often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or bouleous tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, song and dance and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle ‚Äì with his great smile and energy ‚Äì is more than happy to join the parties.
The following morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people at each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come walking.
In this traveling hospital, various health care are provided.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive bees, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate ‚Äì a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally practiced in a school, a mayor or a house; after intervention, the patient wakes up and goes to the wake room to leave his room for the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrical group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers are working until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It is an exciting rhythm, but the musicians of the villages generally help the team to stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can keep working," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts for free during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make a whole difference for those to whom they come for help.
One man explained that his free operation to care for an inheritance would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to having this traveling hospital live and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works in private medical offices around Yaound√© at night.
This is the second job, he explains, which accounts for 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Dr. Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering within Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still at the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity to learn on the ground they do not have at home.
"We have been able to participate in operations to help shed blood or to pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," explained Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have an opportunity to do in America when you are studying medicine in the second year.
Voluntary students generally pay their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with the medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaound√©, their pensions, their transport and education are taken over by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonese people is not near to expand.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happy by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," Mr. Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons that motivate me to do so.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, university students have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but by stressing his weakness for the cross-roads, Science-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbitrary of other works in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
Indeed, but by ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heavier of the faucet that employs Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacred one could not replace the true holy oil, the one of the thesis, which happened.
They have voluntarily recognized him as a great wake-up, animator, and a federate of their work, but noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
In this image the monument of the "Memory Places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages were able to see a giant market in the pussy, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a vibrating eyebrows and a lousy hearing, but incredibly delicious.
The two works published by Nora for almost two years have already established that the one who spent not writing had a lot and a lot of writing.
The book here should definitely make him righteous.
However, once again, there is the temptation of obesity, intellectual vagabonding, the jubilation put to jump as on foot from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the missing objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the brochure back to a single passion: to discover the constituent node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It is a concern of time.
Little by little, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the perennial spirit of our leaders, French identity was a temporal essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, compulsory jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that tracks Pierre Nora is everything else.
He does not inherit eternal freedom, he refuses to define.
An anxious analyst of a family stranger, he is mistaken in a forest of symbols, arrested each step by an object in the form of a rebuff, tortured by annoying questions.
So this one, who is born of the company itself: why, in a country so long-lastingly installed in its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly masqueraded, do we understand these dramatic calls to unity?
They are not so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, but to conjure up the birth of the differences in French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that doubles the national history.
From the Seism of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; he was concerned about finding the sacredness of it and being so much more attuned to unity and indivisibility that it had cut the head of the one who was its evident and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation shared between the left and the right, laity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To feel this singularity of the French identity, nothing is worth four steps outside of the Hexagon, so that the American escape from Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one revolution, written a statement of rights, and I want to set up a new society.
But the U.S. Cousin makes it better to emphasize what is clean for us.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer cared about it.
Here, men covered by an ancient indigenous regime, and even more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when she here planted the drama and confiscate it.
There are always respected founding fathers, and here there are revolutionary ancestors who are doomed to make models, and who have been confused about the rest.
There is an institutional consistency, and here there is a cascade of constitutions, such as errors to catch and attempts to resume.
France, France, France, France, France
There was, however, a time when the French thought they could cut off the clothes that had been torn off their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this third Republic, central time and creator, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: greeting those who were then used to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schools everything that in ancient France had obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity only took a while.
This is once again in the debate, which is fuelled by the immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of claims minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes and the sketches of France that comes.
With, first of all, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We find out that the fireplace was a couple.
The man of the multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The ledger was located in the center of the center.
And the one who had filed, here's more than half a century, a subject on the idea of the nation, but it was the initial exercise of the thesis, trusts us, cum grano salis, that he will end up doing it.
Certain in a less rigid, more fragile and subtle form.
But we don't cheat, we don't cheat. It's also binding.
Because much more than the figure imposed on the university course, this thesis says the inner need for a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Taken to Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team "Antenna 2" came to film a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation of the Association for the Defence of the Otages of the World, which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Held more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida at the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc F√©ret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Gr√¢ce on Wednesday afternoon, they were able, since, to find their families.
And try, at least, to resume the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages of the World".
From the evening of your release, you were on the 20th floor of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, for example, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it makes black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very inclined too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very inclined.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive on the site of the hotel Summerland where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first rounds to parents, the family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And I had dinner in a t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to escape to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
When we arrived there in a helicopter, we took a private plane that takes us to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival on the French soil take place?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and it's full.
The descent of the plane ladder, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and at home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin is driving.
The bikers take off the bourbon to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do some police to stop some of them from coming up.
Media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're all suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, rather complex to manage.
But we've done the hardest.
The night itself, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV.
Then start a kind of life-rehabilitation, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like vacations.
How have medical examinations and DGSE debriefing been performed?
I was entitled to a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Greece the following days my return: radios, exams in all kinds and meet with a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that does everything, but we know that we can rely on it, remind it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
This is part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostages.
It was logical.
It didn't hurt me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I hear what they say.
The debate on the budgets in particular.
Some things make me angry, others less angry.
I'm trying to share things between questions about my past as hostage and my presidential helmet from the association "Otages of the World" that allows me to put away, and I find it much more interesting to approach.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fought, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the stay.
I think there's a semantic problem.
The taking of "political" hostages - which is the case most of the time - must be qualified and allow hostages to have access to justice, to bring complaints and to bring their hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is done for that.
Why don't you tell the hostages "you've broken the rules of war, like those of all the conventions in Geneva, you're going to be brought to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be founded, legitimate, and sound.
This message is heard, but it's not listened, and I'm shocked.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger spreads into the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President deputed Mohamed Morsi, they went down to the streets.
Mobilization throughout Egypt to claim the restoration of the first democratically elected president of the country.
This is not a trial that highlights this Muslim Brotherhood militant.
Until now, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial instigated by a pro-Morsi, he is the one who is supposed to be judged Sisi, not the other.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Faces broke in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel accuses 9 American States of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military partners have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with," the Minister in New York recalled in an address to the Anti-Defamation League against anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to partners of the same sex in the National Guard's facilities" established in their territory, which they have denounced, accusing them of violating the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these persons cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said that he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The front of the nine States began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the National Guard's deployments, due to a conflict between the texane law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to some 5600 active persons, including the National Guard, Reserve and Pensions.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hy√®res
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard took place on Saturday 2 November at the skate park in Hy√®res.
Organised by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are held on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the rally at 10 a.m. before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the awarding of prices at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical strengths of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen, and he likes nothing but to show off to competitors who exceed three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto chases journalists who came to ask him about a drug case
In Canada, Mayor Toronto is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media.
A video released to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always refused to use crack, while recognizing that he has a pen for cannabis.
On Thursday, he chased several journalists from his property and questioned him.
We also think that sometimes the images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, October 31, that a case of rage had been detected in a cabin in the Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The caton was found in Argentina on 25 October and died on 28 October.
The anger diagnosis was confirmed by Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and take care of persons who could have entered into contact with this caton between 8 October and 28 October," says the Departments of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the caton have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"With man, prevention of human rage, administered after contact with the animal carrier, but before symptoms appear, is very effective," the communiqu√© said.
The departments now call on those who would have been bitten, bitten, scratched, or laid on a mucous membrane or on a skin damaged by this cat or whose animal would have been in contact with this cat between 8 and 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free of anger since 2001, this caton or mother has been imported from another country, not free", according to the communiqu√©.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last case of "acute" of identified rabies dates back to December 1998 on a kidney and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (IIA)".
A case of anger on an illegally imported dog from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"The anger is a fatal disease if it is not treated in time," the departments recall and is transmissible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama is behind his reform of the health system
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his promise without doubt and often repeated that ‚Äúif you are satisfied with your health care, you can keep it.‚Äù
After hundreds of thousands of people received feedback from their providers, the Republicans criticized the president over the last few days by accusing him of cheating the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a lack of confidence in the current situation", President Obama urged Americans who were receiving these opinions to seek new market insurance.
Most people will be able to obtain full and better health schemes at the same price, or even less expensive than expected.
"You'll win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5 per cent of the population that themselves contracted their insurance were forced to change the regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "poorly".
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I'm looking forward to regaining your trust.
It is an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her micro cut, addressing a assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting yesterday following a exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced the government's sponsorship insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel features a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy chosen Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the track level.
German Sebastian Vettel, a four-time Formula 1 World Championship, took off for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from among the 1,500 designs sent around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, and its sponsorship.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to bring this helmet on Friday and Saturday, to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his party of the banlieue
We don't cheat on each other.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" does not address only the banlieusards.
I've chosen a map of France as a logo, he justifies it.
When I speak of banlieu, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
Its project, presented on Thursday in press conference in its native municipality of Auberviliers, is born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural milking pot that characterizes all neighborhoods.
My proposal No.1 is to create a multiculturalism department, it says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorially attached, today claims to be "100% apolitic" even though he has not always been neutral.
Military in 2002 on the side of Jean-Pierre Chev√©nement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I propose in my programme are linked to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will listen to them, too.
There are only extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme - consulting on the Internet - from many topics to talk to the banleys and in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of the guardian of the building...
It remains to be found for candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, it may be fair, he recognizes."
It's a time and money problem.
The Banley Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy, and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that he already has seven lists in Metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the letters of support I have received since yesterday don't all come out of banlieu" he rejoiced.
John Kerry admitted, without precedent, that American espionage "was too far away in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry indicated a reduction in the United States' defensive attitude towards his surveillance programs by admitting, without precedent, that, on several occasions, espionage "was too far away in an inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had been a "automatic pilot" when a series of fire-fighting revelations by denominator Edward Snowden regarding NSA espionage activities had been observed.
The escapes put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Kerry said: "It is unthinkable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in an automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on September 11th."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the American espionage had exceeded the limits, but stressed that the rights of everyone had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to the people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one is mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have been very good at preventing airplanes from falling, explosive buildings and people from being killed because we have been able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, American legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, the Senate subcommittee on European affairs explained on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut stated that he had spoken before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is very important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment to combating terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the European Senate Subcommittee, during an interview since Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue working together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some United States allies, but the Director of the Agency stated this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it was related to the metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents published by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and from 34 other Heads of State.
The Director of Information Services, James Clapper, justified the spionation of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this stormy atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would understand members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to prove "closed in affection".
He explained that the European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have been applying themselves for years.
"We can modify our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans' rights, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do espionage," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to go this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the response generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, culminated in Shell's bad results and on the day of a announcement by the Fed of the maintenance in the state of its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian calls for his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in Phuket for claiming to have been abused by a taxi driver, appealed to the trial and was released under bail.
Steve Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled it, attacked him earlier on Sunday 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separation from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local commissioner's cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in a low-security detention centre in the Phuket area rather than in a prison for women.
This is the daughter of the former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the foreign affairs department in Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to go to Australia.
"We have obviously lived a distressing moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed for judgment and was released after payment of a deposit of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that while waiting, it was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but they warned that the appeal could lead to an extension of the sentence that could go up to two years in prison and imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to reduce its damaged image to tourists, which could lead to a execution.
French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters other than the RSCA cars.
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain fixed Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson for the Brussels-midi police area, announced on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this meeting of the League of Champions will have to use the RSCA displacement system.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stage," the spokesman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture indicated that measures had been taken to allow arrests or to be carried out by guards," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Committee
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
That is what motivated, one year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback among several cultures.
The School Committee has just revealed its vision of "Live together in French".
The Vision of Diversity has been walking in schools for one year to help students of all origins discover common references that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Some great names of writers, artists, whether they're of origin or they're from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"Then, projects are created so that they can identify themselves to all of this," explains the President of Vision diversity, A√Øda Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support for staff in the transformations that we live in the student clientele," he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board has set up a research centre that will give teachers tools that sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"The different pedagogical strategies, that's the real need," she said.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: language, school, social and cultural.
