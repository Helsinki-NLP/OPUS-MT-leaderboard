A Republican Strategy to Prevent Obama's Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this last a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a beam.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of American governments have enacted new laws, starting in 2009, that make registration or voting difficult.
This phenomenon has been extended since the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 Bills were introduced during 2011 that restricted the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the election and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present an identity document with photographs.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities were therefore reluctant to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported Bills in 34 states to force voters to present an identity document with a photograph.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people aged from voting, do not have any identity document with a photograph issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
However, obtaining the required identity document often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions thus disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of those who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens aged 65 and 20 per cent of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have a photo-identity document.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who most vote for democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with a photograph issued by their institution.
In addition, the same states authorize members of the fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote to the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished electoral registration on the same day of election in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create an aid service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that promoted the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter did not represent more than 13 per cent of the state voters.
In the case of Hispanics, exactly the same would happen.
These represent no more than 11 per cent of voters, which is equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent no more than 46 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the register of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked a number of bills.
The United States Ministry of Public Prosecutors intervenes to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, it was possible to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the submission of an identity document with a photograph.
However, it is unacceptable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the party nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they intend to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too ready to confirm with certainty whether these legislative amendments at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer detection: Is the test done or not done?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which useless medical interventions are decided upon.
It is more than enough to make men doubt, already reticent of themselves, whether or not the detection tests should be done.
Is the test done or not?
We've asked for advice from the experts.
Studies in the United States identified a large index of infection among the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between the patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, followed by 12 years of age, also showed that between 30 and 40 per cent of the potential for metastasis had not been tested.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the risk level of his or her cancer. All possible options should be offered to him or her and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not respond to long-term life, in which case it should be chosen rather by active monitoring of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since that cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if this progress is made, we offer them treatment.
We have increasingly determined the precise criteria to decide who should or should not be dealt with.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be performed.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smokes, that rate would be at least 50%," stressed André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against tobacco continues to be a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It is extremely damaging to people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesperson André Beaulieu said.
One hopeful data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
The weight
Fatigue and obesity also favour the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Charcutaneous products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for its ahumid, dried or salted may cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the time being, their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in the other, what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family backgrounds of each individual with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs's box in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs boson caused a great shock last summer, and rightly.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is participate of the responsible mechanism of the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicts the standard model: our better or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it's not quite clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks much like the Higgs boson preached by the standard model.
In addition, new data released this week at an important physical congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there is still more data to be completely secure.
In any case, we assume that this is Higgs, because the chances of making mistakes seem small.
In this great world, there is a generalized and irrefutable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that norm and don't try it too hard, because it will end up doing harm.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantical state"; a "state" which consists, in a large way, of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify the particles in two categories.
On the one hand, we meet with the good citizens called fermiones, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand are the boons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories, which is, by the way, extraordinary, the boons are divided into two groups: the moons, of which we will not talk here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature are propagated and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These boons, you might stress here, they're not the exotic kisses we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extremely banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" that acts as "messager" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, "distorts" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrareds, ultraviolets, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force carriers".
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it's about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" to make this boson appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. In order to activate it, it is necessary to reach extremely high energy, a little as if it were a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That is why it takes a huge acceleration of particles like CERN's (the great hadron collisioner is a 27 km circumference ring!) to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept by itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while the rest (like photon, by default) do not have it.
Now, what can all these investigations bring?, Mrs. Plamondon asked.
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows the physicists to scrutinize the differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many are eager to meet, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physical" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, we must say, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or the dark matter, which accounts for about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such research in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be no one.
To see: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution their work would cause.
They interviewed the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the tools around the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light capturer in 1969 in the course of his optical research.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this capturer now serves as an eye for all the world's digital devices, which was valued by the Nobel for physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but they never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Committee to die in dignity, Quebec had recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed as soon as a draft law is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
The Devoir tried to look for him.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Monterégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying her had given her a two-year breath.
"They had given me five years of life, but I'm already seven," she relates, a walk, falling into her bed in the Beloeil palliative care centre, Victor-Gadbois, which came the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," she goes on.
The disease has caused him damage: a huge weakness that prevents him from going only to the bathroom and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetiteful lunch, he accepts renegade to help him eat.
Valiente, she comes even to smile, to talk to the strangers who pay her attention, bring her medicine and offer her a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhoea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes a bed," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer curative care.
Mrs. A., 89, is the greatest fear of dying "conscious and exhausted".
But the disease has made her children know.
"I have some good kids," he adds.
"I no longer have any more wishes in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and help with food.
They're palliative care that they're given when you can't do anything else.
To help her death be more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a bed of palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, as we know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether physically, emotionally, or spiritually.
The moribundo is offered with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of daily life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, your son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In Victor-Gadbois center the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his lunches while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by persons under 45 years of age with cancer", says Dr. Christiane Martel.
A 53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadboisarrivant center come from their home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Palliative Care Society at the Grand Montreal Home, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative deficiency in Quebec's health care, which makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the eminence of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been on the move to demonstrate their opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted with euthanasia.
"Recently," he says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in emergency suffering great pain without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients will want to die only because they do not receive proper care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are opposed to their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard’s survival expectations were already low when he left out an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me I was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she said.
"However, she had told me there was nothing more to do!"
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who ask to die thank their caregivers for not responding to their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually use palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until his death, either in sporadic or permanently.
We can't pretend that we don't understand that part of suffering.
More and more, unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be fed."
This report has been made possible through a journalism scholarship from health research institutes in Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fund-raisers of political parties and Italian Mafia specialists have, day after day, what they know about a tremendous "system", which is part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafias.
A "industry" that was too expensive for the Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It turns out curious how the system is spraying once we've hunted the big media," ironically, Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the abuses associated with road contracts in Quebec, which the prime liberal minister, Jean Charest, at that time, had only allowed to delay.
The "Dutchneau Report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of parties and corruption among officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to remain with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen to two mayors", he adds, while waiting to be able to "show the existing strategies behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government stakeholders, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of the "Marteau squad", which, since 2009, have made Montreal's "cartel of the cantarillad" move in time to inflame contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registering a series of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his mayor's post in Laval, the third city in Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
It has been formally charged with engineers of the Montreal road network and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurus and Lino Zambito.
The latter was shocked to explain to the committee the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
For three years he paid a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the mafia who transferred the money to the Montréal Union, the mayor's Gérald Tremblay party.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and the left during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of contracts for arable land
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an engineer of public works, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and company bribes for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for contracts with accruing costs.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflaming bills between 30% and 40% in terms of false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately taking a bold view of a parallel budget and filled his dirty money chests.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay left early in November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money of electoral campaigns was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she pulls "from a thread so that she can understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits".
And it adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but there would be a clean research unit in Montreal and be very careful not to repeat the questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of the "elected politicians in the stream of the stratage."
Estimate 70 per cent of the percentage of dirty money spent on funding electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironically, "they told me that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to it, "until electoral spending is strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a full review of the public procurement and party financing system: "We cannot fall further; go to the bottom of things, with courage, it will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story pushes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who are going to look at the mirror.
"The PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would that advance explain it?
It could be explained by an individual awareness-raising process, but also by the new size of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Advancing day by day at your side.
Technical personnel have also brought me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a party, that's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't regret it.
From my beginnings in the pre-formation centre of Clairefontaine's INF to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I've always made progress on an urgent step.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to fighting very high-level parties.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me much in terms of my positioning.
It is supported by supporters like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, no one is equal in League 1 and is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's been working with big players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our lead.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our greatest goals is the League of Champions: we have classified ourselves for the eight finals in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, in order to begin, to finish the first of our league in front of the Porto in order to be able to receive the turn of eights in the end.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is being delivered to its resources to ensure that the project is implemented.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in bringing this title as champions.
Last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the best conditions to finish the first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be good.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Burdeos are fighting for the title, I think we're dealing with the guns to take him away.
Do you think the media expect more than the PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 home in Troyes, they still meet with things that reproach us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what the people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the League of Champions we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for eight finals, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been "pulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say we've got a Zlatendendency.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and has many goals.
It has come to prove that it is the star of League 1.
And he's shown on all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live Eurocopa 2012 with the team in France?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I went out reinforced.
Today I win good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we must have exemplary behavior today.
What view do you have of the first month of Didier Deshamps in front of the blues?
He's getting results.
They are well located in the World Classification Group.
The selector is strict, close to the players and inspires to win.
Like Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deshamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the empate (1-1) of 16 October in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I didn't have a game like that in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, paying and selling without banks
All contrary to the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, the transactions identified and the processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a safe exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equally.
About 200,000 transactions have been recorded through 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment form.
The bitcoin quote, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before the 10 dollars were returned today (quotations are listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not surprising if we compare it with world changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credit", used to advance in a video game that can be won by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes change).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange, a central authority controls and deals with the changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of books of accountancy, verifiers, coin issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing the anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes are contained in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key hit is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is due to the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a type of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file sharing, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical trace.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "trace" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular trace (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the mark.
If, in order to make a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would accept only one of the two transactions as valid; the other would remain an orphan, as both have different marks.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network already has its high places.
The websites that offer Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The case used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash actually has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November the "magnificent rains" were launched.
"The $30,000 has changed," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes quite in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain in the anonymity.
The system is easy to set up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide you with an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that there are thousands of users.
There is a general movement for the revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but there could be a change in 2013," she predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB intends to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event that this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have particularly punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, more wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes unite the jihadists, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbek or the Tayikos.
Tolerable, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when the Westerns become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from above the hills planted of almond trees thanks to the French credits, was ordered.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban flow in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since its irresistable advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Its control over the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old multi-ahidins, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, being made with government land to resell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the pair of huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are faithless; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: capital escape is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state colleges are full of both girls and children.
Those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to work.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. Turkish television and its leaflets that feature a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to direct the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will flee the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, eliminating the position of the prime minister that has existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the basis of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country is dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no embalming has been fixed, and important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing happens except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been required.
The rumor that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth expanded.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take over from them.
No energy to extract the iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up the huge Buddhist location and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' colleges, children's colleges, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, sanitary and agricultural fields and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of attempting to "wine the hearts and the spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of bringing aid and offensive actions together, a service of "civil and military actions" by the Ministry of Defence (Chimic), which was abolished in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain locations.
These works, greedy to obtain local labor, have been able to help to contain insurrection: river, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often located more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they wish to do, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid and to bring it directly to them.
A Constitution with strengths in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it temporary full powers, it has decided to play it all over.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given that Assembly two months more to finish his work.
And nearly two years ago, Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakened institutional stability and led to judicial confusion.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For its opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "traiting his word" and "tracing the right".
On the part of its partners, it is ensured that it is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while debate causes damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or they vote my text or I hold the full powers", powers which are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its vast majority, voted yesterday.
Most of the liberals did not go to the summons.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they believed that they could not make their views known.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brothers.
As I could expect, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, that one of the few differences in the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so that a number of committee members came to think that the Constituent's watch was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday, contains 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the subject of all views, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulates that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "rules", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and of their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals take it out of hypocrisy and consider it no more than a advertising craft.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm compliance with Sharia's laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the assumptions of a theocracy."
The fears of liberals are further increased by the fact that the next principal of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not students but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic case law, etc.].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent civil judges are competent to speak over all of this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms referring to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers will claim that they are few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Nor will civil proceedings be prohibited in military courts, as human rights associations requested.
They also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberalized.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, under the emphasis of Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The leaders of the head of state were present on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the world's obstetrician and a saltwater sea
The promised earth combines the magnificence of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine into the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the filled networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are located in Jerusalem.
The believers travel here by Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Delorosa").
Begins in the Fortaleza of Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was carried out, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre in Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Union and the place of the burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian obligation of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in a place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people from different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then be realized.
Perform a vertical travel
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountains at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to the climbing can.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m there is the famous Hermon ski station, where in the winter months there is a great stream of tourists.
So far, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain they supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all on one trip.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It retains the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has ties of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
The entry is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You're in him and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives are sung.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that even in the winter months in the Red Sea, the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed there throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point of the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
Blue waters there are a salmon that easily sustains even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around you are truly beautiful.
People come here to take treatment courses with salt water, salmon and curative crops and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to arrange their broken nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Old Age
They are preserved by the old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here where Noah built his ark and Persia rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "messy" symbol, fortune will be a favor to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples from newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Poncio Pilato.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If he travels to Israel, he does not worry if his English leaves much to wish for: in this country about 30 per cent of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shequels (currently 1-3$.8 shequels).
The urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast traffic and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
Actually, it's from a underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and at this price you can travel by transbursing for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Saturdays are celebrated.
From Friday night to the setting of the sun on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts its work.
But Sunday morning starts a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only served kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of beef and sheep meat dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are floured shrimp balls, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well fed cats who "pass on to their taste" in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The roners love the places they compete and do not reject the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Gettz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And the renting of a bicycle will go out for 15 shakes a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 sequentials.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to the country and rested were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which exceeds 51% in the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While Members and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the law on compulsory review, they have already appeared in the country of shy trade with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money to help your families who have stayed home.
Since 1 December, a law has come into force, whereby each migrant worker must conduct an examination to verify his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, Community services institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to review the language, if not also the Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language are exceptions.
Persons who have obtained their education and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of review centres will be served by the Russian-language Institute Pushkin, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to present evidence in all cities, and now more than 160 centres of this type are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: And what will this really bring?
What changes will the mandatory knowledge of the language, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves, bring about?
First of all, representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
Immigrants have problems without profession, education, who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the immigrant future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, with the pretext of helping, put a "paid traveler" to a mirroring and narrow cove, where he and dozens of others like him consume for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay their promised wages," says the head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get angry, boss!
However, while so many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they not only know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much your fault but its own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tayikos can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to give children to eat, because they don't talk about getting dressed, kicking them and buying them what they need for school.
When you get to adolescence, these guys get used to working on the first chance.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize them.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, rights defenders point out an important point.
The examinations shall be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no review and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and by only a thousand fifty rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"A hundred or two hundred rubles are required for cigarettes or tea," said journalist Umed Hushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Come on, don't be tight, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it was shown that not only immigrants' registration documents could be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed in standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is twice as much as the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diploms" can not be bought, convergence of government officials and rights defenders.
To date, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who would not have been able to pass the exam for the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered work that does not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to implement the law with greater rigour regarding the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: To catch shots during weddings in which there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinográdov, in which to catch seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of trauma weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a licence to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the arms possession law would be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures be taken of "unreasonable rigour".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, Russia's BBC news service, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms were committed during the six months of 2012, compared with a total of 1168 recorded crimes for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a more stringent legislation in the civil use weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to address the black market.
Now, according to your words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says Colonel Víctor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Higher State.
Screenshot of the website that accepts arms orders
The first, "military or military vestige", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were broken by the Russian and Caucasian officials," says Baranets.
The following type of "black weapon" was stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons come out of the military arsenals for sale.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were caused prematurely to cover the lack," says an ex-military.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also put their sand granite.
"Now they have distributed private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market and distribute arms under the control of the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Many guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes crafts, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," the former military explains.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of illicit arms supply on the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal literature and public access data from portals whose topic revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from armed forces and security forces.
Half of the weapons of the black market have arrived there "on account of officials whose work is related to weapons", the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during arms production and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The guy in charge of one of the arms stores, who asked for his name not to be mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal diggers did not buy them for a long time because they were too old.
More often, it says, suppliers address military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some affair, the supplier buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the valley.
"This carries the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," we say.
"But, of course, the police are at the heart of all matters, so periodically, when the crime detection plan has to be implemented, they make proof purchases to illegal arms dealers," the addict adds.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would lead me to a "screw" where we could negotiate.
At the price of the gun, I'll only get it there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"In order to get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop manager. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also a need to get there, let's say "on the part of Mr. Ivanovich, who asked him to tell you that a tooth had fallen on his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel sleeves through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to delude him.
The new people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military, Viktor Baranets, was tested in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article was available on this subject.
Schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no "everything".
"I felt like a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, does not offer a cat for free: everything there is can be proved.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; let's go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"You give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Soup Store
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups where we offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal encounters are required for this purpose.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising notice title "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There the users make their orders and ask questions.
And sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asked the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy a gun TT. Moscow," he laconically raises his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two hands for those who want to buy firearms.
And the people went, as the hungry fish did to the hart, and then to pull out coals in Siberia.
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: in general, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the gun is hidden," reports the NGO press secretary "The Right to Arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one remains unarmed and puts him in prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two hands for those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the liver, and then to extract coal from Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half should be expected.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-class leaders.
According to official ministerial statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which is 22,900, and the number of cases identified as theft and extorting of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
The employees of fast and supermarket restaurants in the United States are being beaten.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, in the United States, a wave of protests against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken" have been launched.
For now, no one dares to know whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose strength and get away in its first stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of Walmart workers and those of the fast-food system, the objective of protest organizers is the creation of workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the day of Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Fridays". That day, in the United States, the herding orgy that captured millions of inhabitants was accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some employees of the Walmart corporation, who employ 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protests alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in corporate stores, whose products are directed to modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything, from clothes, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are averaged between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and delivery of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of mountings or hand scanners.
Those "Black Fridays" participants demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary up to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on consumers' shoulders, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12,39 more than they spend now.
Walmart's supporters are pleased that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its shops from 8 o'clock in the afternoon of Thursday until midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their registration boxes carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the Huffington Post left-wing website, that they left their "less than five" jobs in Walmart and that the protest had not been more than "another trick of public relations", organized by the workers' union.
"Free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the goals were not exactly the large Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and therefore for now there is no one), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells thousands of millions of portions, and then they don't even give you the discount for sickness and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants will increase it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one wants less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's something incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers spent their time at McDonald's and worked there, behind the indicators, in part time after school, although they were still living with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal magazine, there is a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to give them to eat.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast-food cashiers and cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, that is to say, double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be established in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits administration from prohibiting this right and from punishing activists of the trade union movement with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main is the excessive rotation of staff.
Distorts
Noisey protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place half the half in McDonald's located near Times Square, where several local politicians participated, in particular the member of the City Council of Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says he's selling thousands of millions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent Democrats in New York, such as the candidate for mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast-food sector in order to receive fair wages and economic prosperity that every New Yorkino deserves."
As the New York Times described it, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employed in the fast food service, where tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy."
The topic of increased reality, so popular among modern technology lovers, is recently perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at his annual Google conference, he demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, Microsoft was supposed to have also submitted an application for the patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was argued that for scientists in that company, the glasses were already part of a past phase.
They are attracted to the perspective of the handling of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the study object of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the personal-computer interaction, but we are also trying to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now, mankind in its large mass has been caught in the working phase with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ago and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in controlling by gestures.
- What about the future?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change this, we're working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world must be freed from computer science to our physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to the devil with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you cannot be considered a panacea, it is up to you to solve the issue of privacy, as you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device camera, but by a pulse that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wrist watch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, e.g. gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this cup of soda to you?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- Or do you want to force users to adapt to what they can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good deep resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about the modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution on X and Y axes, but also on Z.
It is also important to speed, number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it can be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the man-machine interaction.
To me, it would be very useful for my work to have an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And isn't it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is actually the infrared transmitter and the second receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that from the point of view of the daily use of increased technology of reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased reality "transmutable" when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could go from the glasses to the smart phone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (the private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the movie "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakdown in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of touchy sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really oriented towards making these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone was supplanting it in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrists for the doll that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this too is a promising direction.
- Has he tried to deceive the brain?
Does it make him think he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open, almost endless space. We are also working on the idea of racing tapes (not like those of gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant globes.
For now, cheating on the brain is not so easy, it still has to work for many years.
That is what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens facing, to the avant-garde of art and culture.
In this list of the best there are brilliant figures of art and the scene of San Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: often they find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
The pictures of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophists of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the San Petersburg vanguardism of the late 80s - the early 90s.
In addition, he is a urban man whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and lifts up all the state of soul.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his existence Bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I'm dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between artist, image makers and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a bit gray causes aggressiveness and agitation of good properties.
But my provocations are directed to start a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you understand that you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Cultural Palace, where my work was shown.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became a friend of the artists of the new wave, with those who were exposed to in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I sat in the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the letters.
It was important for me to meet at the cultural centre of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a music art club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore adjusted pants, among them was the currently fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was an entertainer of many programs before the times of Hali-galivski.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and assiduous customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the poll was conducted in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so finished my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something noticeable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the presentness and occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Pajasos".
Paids are a temporary category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and scary.
But in the pajamas everything is embalmed and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change in clothes.
Now they follow one another through the clothes, pointing in the outside, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person shouldn't even give him a hand, but spit him in the face.
And deception will be eliminated when it changes clothes.
- We just saw you in the role of urban organizer.
Who better than me to be!
- All right, but can commercial art best be nice?
- Now trade art must be scrupulous, sweet, touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people grouped in manadas, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now everyone's divided into micro communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred-dollar ticket to like everyone.
Now we have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And a cultural event goes 300 people, 10,000 never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to waste what you've achieved.
When I was young, I made such pictures that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now the concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money just to paint paintings.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with San Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were all right, the kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in San Petersburg who might well be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate them and open them up.
Now it's prospering the subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is infinite.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from San Petersburg.
Light up in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans aboard depart in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same planet of replacement?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in Venus orbit... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with the flora began to be addressed.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of birds cultivated in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the creation of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, Drosophiles.
In 1979, codorniz eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of pregnancy.
We get a normal pollution as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this pollution has to find support, must be kept on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) Laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When no support was found, the pollutants returned at random.
And after 10 hours in the newborns, a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
Pollutants did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they would just die.
"And twice we got the contaminants born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the contaminants in space.
The last time a biological miniarca flew to orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion", only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, when losing their usual habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instincts.
However, unlike the small animals, man can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have traveled to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female body.
Our gaviosa flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the airspace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told who after long flights have all worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, a hero of the Soviet Union, a hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
In terms of zero fleetability, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newly born child is its birth element.
The small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months within her mother in amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water.
At first, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a recently born swim monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, women need gravity, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy, abdominal and pelvis muscles are decreased very quickly, the ability to expel the foetus is reduced.
Well, we missed that, trusting in the action of stimulants for delivery.
You can, of course, give light to a special camera, it will push it.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special suit for training, as for adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person to Earth, to a totally inappropriate person," says Igor Pestov, head of the Institute of Bioethics of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships turn to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the "szvarc" system has not done with the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is limited.
So said Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, mention Petr Neczas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on the role, which is known as the "szvarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the operation of the office which has an obligation to carry out such controls or require obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee at the Congress of Members, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, which compared public procurement legislation in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel check that we started doing about two years ago.
This is a simplified statement: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, and this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice in itself.
We have united everything and, although control has not yet ended, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more stringent and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more and more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can actually make this project? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely a common control of this kind that could help us stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, reducing and improving the limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting something right at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the allocations, it means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much paper that those who want to find fault in the system can do it more easily than if the limits were kept as high as now.
You talk about our country's problems with the transfer of legislation governing the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it otherwise organized?
In how many offices, such as the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Tribunal of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in his case is structured in a different way, but in principle both offices evolve simultaneously.
However, as Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level, and in this respect it is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, which we call state funds here.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data; however, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately defined in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of the inspectors?
That sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like making this kind of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't for that, you wouldn't have any benefit from collaborating with our office, would you?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act mean for your Office? Is it any way of demonstrating its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in the control actions.
Since we perform ex post controls, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have launched a new tool of "non-economic risk detection", which has led us to spend almost 14,000 public procurements, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection process and similar are corrected.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mistake for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the legislation "is driven" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
As with the previous legislation, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
A system of this type will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called schvarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on the role. What does that mean?
Is the švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the Office from acting that has the obligation to carry out such controls and to require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, the legislation is quite strict in terms of how to act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer for failing to comply with formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
The roads present ice plates, although most of them are transmissible
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads present ice and snowboards.
Although most roads are transitible, caution should be lifted in some cases.
Region of Karlovy Vary
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitible, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops down and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine.
On the other hand, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters in the slopes of the Metal Mountains.
In some places, visibility was still poor due to cloud, according to information from the road traffic control centre of the region.
The R6 and the first category road in the region are now transmissible without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to extreme caution, especially on certain bridges whose surface may be frozen and resbaladizable.
In addition, all roads of the second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also transmissible.
However, in some of them there are still layers of ice and snow on.
There is a need to increase attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, informing the Road and Highway Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates, especially in the higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can be produced in the immediate vicinity of Lanškrona, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokýh Mýta, and especially in the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There are snow especially on the roads of the mountains of Krkonoše and Orlicé Mountains.
There is a snow layer lying in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will today be between dusty and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will generally oscillate between three low zero and a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitible this morning, although caution should be lifted and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be iced, temperatures will rise between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent fall of the temperatures, some roads could also be covered by ice.
In some places drivers will find themselves cloudy, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the Road Operations Control Centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is transitible almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to extreme caution, especially on the road between kilometres 80 and 131.
The surface of most first category roads is dry and without ice.
In the Pilsen and Tachov road area bordering with Germany there may be ice-plates.
The second and third category lines are wet, so in this case they also warn of ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less-passed routes in the area of Shumava.
Olomouc Region
The drivers who go to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will be found with partially depleted snow.
After chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the way to Videlský kříž.
The road operators removed the snow during the night; on the Shumper road they accumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to the administrators of the roads.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transmissible without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of Shumper's road, there are snowfalls.
The drivers at the port of Červenohorské will meet with a medium-dried snow in the direction of Jeseník," a road management operator from Šumper to ČTK has confirmed today.
On the ground and at night they also approached their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the trails of the highest areas are now cleared and wet.
On the road of Olomouc the roads are transmissible without restrictions, in the road of Šternberská drivers should drive carefully on the forest tracks, where the roads remain wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
The road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different plots at the first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
The temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lower areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain in the footwear. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central macis, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No service complications have been recorded by the House.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow is expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavorable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarming news that we like to catch up with.
The Tap Tap music group likes to joke about this, and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to put the end of the world or avoid it.
In addition, in December you will organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It is a state-friendly act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the May calendar set out for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the previous day, on 20 December at 21 a.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end about the same time as the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
At first it was my idea, then we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at the beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it'll be just the last, good, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All performers will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The anthems will be linked simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech TV.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
Most of them have been shown to be interested in working with us.
What will be the purpose of the money collected in concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment for the educational centre without barriers Studio, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the Civil Association Tap in Jedlikkov štav.
Students from Jedlijkov Institut school regularly receive a visit from teachers with whom they engage in fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to do so.
As part of the completion of the Jedlikkov ústav works, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and interpreters act.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you expect any other "spectacular action" similar in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Prague Jaro festival, so here we will certainly prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
The next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of our being in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalists, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How is logistics and the organization of these trips?
It's not that hard how it can look at first sight.
There are five members in the electric wheel chair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared so far, something that did not stop surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back a short time ago, everything came out without problems.
You can compare the different attitudes of society to those with disabilities and other aspects by going abroad.
What have you found them with so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is much way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there remains no frequency that a person moves alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as current as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in the wheelchair in the elevator, it's not there.
Fortunately, a civil association has been established that seeks to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on those directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move on their account in public and be able to go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap Let's go a little ahead!
A respectful society or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes when prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will start to change everything.
So far, there are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years back, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I went as an educator at Jedlijkov Institute, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among other things, the saxophone, I started an amateur group with a workmate.
And in time, as our moderator Ládźa Angelovich says, we went a little out of our hands.
However, the popularity has not come to these last years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that it helped us quite well to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also allow ourselves to be taught quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, which can be done in a different way.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and it takes a long time to accept it.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well with people with disabilities, then it's not just an advance for them, it's for society as a whole.
Did he help you to be a demanding boss, as many people describe him?
If we want to do quality work, we must be strict in many aspects and require certain discipline.
I think it's totally normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they realize that they have to go two days to try, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't avoid it.
Anyone who has will and wills will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena de Prague, in Fléda de Brno and Plynojem in Ostrava and will take part in 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through videoconferencing to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment from the educational centre without barriers to the STUDDEO in Jedlikkov štav of Prague, with a cost of 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free entry in the pre-sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member of the ESA of the former Eastern Europe bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began to work closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission during the subsequent years.
However, the way from Poland to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had already dedicated themselves to flying to space before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference of A. Sternfeld in the astronomical observatory of Warsaw in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautique".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the indifferent assistants and, years later, Sternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautique".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautique.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautism, he was known worldwide and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a train was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Regrettably, the author of the proposal is unknown and the scope of the project is not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the train or for its braking.
Information on this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Techniki Uzbrojenia Komórka in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
On the basis of the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation has reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the Rohoziński engineer appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakitobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczysowy Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all draft missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautique appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautique (Polish Towarzystó Astronautique).
The November 1954 issue of the Problemy magazine refers for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Professor Sototwicze proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautism.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has longed to form part of the International Astronautic Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA has become a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He performed this task until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the rocket probe RM (Meteorological Rocket), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apex of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg of weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed, and in the summer of 1959 air tests of the RM-2 rockets began in two stages in the Błądów desert.
The rocket weighed 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket would be the subject of a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket would have an apogeo of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of altitude.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-step rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (names Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed between themselves by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, in Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum height in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km of height.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the space space research on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Judge suspended the Social Bar Association Act.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
From then on it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less regulatory competition.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with the unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour cost (wages) is economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and thus "probably lowers" the competitor's price with the aim of making it with most of the market and thereby increasing its margin of profit.
To a large extent, for most entrepreneurs, it means moving production abroad, buying cheaper or disappearing there. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, it is not responsible for the unemployment this phenomenon generates, it necessarily increases the social expenditure of the state.
This whole situation is conducive to the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and in compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in order to obtain benefits.
The situation is so universally known that concrete statistical data is not required.
Unscrupulous practices in private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to compel the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees in respect of employment rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing the gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years now, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of help is already at the millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public with regard to the situation of assistant employees in the German federal parliament.
The measures to save virtually all states of the southern EU are undoubtedly leading to the same situation. People, pressured by an abismal decline at their social level, are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or to abuse with a very bad wage at the frontier of society, hoping that someday it will reach the private capital country.
Do you have to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or Africans continue to work for an infinite part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media say to the wisdom that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which leads to the failure of the economy.
The private capital defends with nails and teeth thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by taking control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital is not influenced by its selfishness in the political process and therefore throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clear.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in the very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favour, in a legislation that is virtually acceptable everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting draft laws to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is adopted later on the Bundestag, the German Parliament.
Thus, not all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like the one that describes Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state took time to disintegrate and the administrations took care of the force."
In exchange for bribes, unlawfully obtained favors and help finance stones or swords.
The bribe and corruption spread without interference, and people turned to the urns with the pre-populated vote"... "there were no people with the character to aspire to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "He started to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was self-cracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appian thought of Pompey, Caesar ascended to power and transformed democracy forever into self-cracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in ancient times, is that the present society is based on unbiased preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
The private capital is, in essence, unable to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of the then, a decline in the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it deeply.
The causes of the increase in fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the free liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a defined pause, pending the next blow.
The fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and within the EU, the Czech government will be forced to continue seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete sociopolitical reforms, which strengthen both the participation of the state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos lab.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (nothing from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his Fragile song and whose stribillo prays "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget the fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be no "Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have occurred, as always.
On the one hand, on the other hand, Israel argues in favour of the right to self-defense and enlists Palestinians in the role of terrorists; on the other hand, it supports Palestinians and claims racism by the state of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and a terrorist attack on Israel.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the repeated killings and who is the victim. In the end, the citizens of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live through the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the screen, a look to find out who takes advantage of the tensions that have taken place for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small area of the Middle East land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on the conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, about who or which group of people is the main promoter of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of struggles for power is in the first line.
At each time we can find a Magno Alejandro or Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always those who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live at a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated on the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the most prominent (if anyone is still behind, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
It's not much written near them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant strengthening for them.
They have important participations in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, have been declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the defeat of Gadafi there were only four, but Russia has suspended the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Central Bank of America of Rothschild, began to print money during the Secession War and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to demand the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Its afane by the world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the Maison Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the major monarchy states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain; and the third proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (such as the number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a preliminary project for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong, and always lead to a deterioration in the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So after the success of the death of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after that, as a result, World War I was triggered, Russia was destroyed by the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unwarrantedly from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitulation (wars to end Zarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent demise of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, undercover, a conflictous situation resulting from the huge war repairs imposed on Germany, creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the poor masses. Later, they had to serve them with the Germans the Führer solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to guilt, and then to build a Czechoslovakian nationwide with a strong German minority that should represent and represent the function of the fifth column, which took the call and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
It was World War II: it is hard to know whether Hitler had drawn too much of the rope the international bankers had attached to in principle or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the best conditions for accepting the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly, in the way that war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If the international bankers could initiate it, the Jewish nation, like in World War II, would become a victim of the first-line battle, now along with the Arab population or, generally, the Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within its country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are divided in an exciting way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice lead to injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at first it was the greed of some individuals and their greed for the world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandates, because, just as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does all he can to declare war on Iran and, considering Iran as a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan) would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the close of Ormuz, where 20% of the world's oil passes through (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls the whole of his being.
"And it obliges all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or on the front, not to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: who has two fingers in front, adding the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-six hundred and six."
Argo Film: If it gets rough, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamic students took up the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the corrupt shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: taking the shah on board could not allow it, since if it did, it would endanger the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even more with the failed attempt to free hostages by force.
The diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran has made a decisive contribution to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck discusses an episode of this story, which brought a small success to America.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped the building.
After a complicated period, they ended up in the Canadian embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, which helped a covert story: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the cinematographic team that examined the country's location for the rotation of a superproduction of fiction science.
Gender combination
The plan taken by the expert in "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
In order for the lie to appear true, it was written on the cinematographic project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, fiction production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of different genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper motion", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the state of mind. We find well documented sequences of Tehran. The credit sequence shows emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were also placed in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And moreover, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: worn men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the office corridors, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been bullied, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is its third long metre, after "Adios Small, Adios" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which action is not taking place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic of the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Teheran will "do it" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's taking is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that at the same time transmits the emotion of the unconcerned and the lack of predictiveness that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the taxing team in Tehran Basar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it's pretty well arranged. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here everything doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unbridled search after its track becomes a madness).
Argo's weakness is the discontrolling of the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, not much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic track, but it's a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, evaluate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it falls, it'll be hard.
As an expression of a real story and as proof of the exaggerated notion of omnipresentity and omniscience of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"After the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 per cent quota of women in senior positions in large European companies," said Pávo Patrick Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities cited, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013, Nacher reported.
Among the EU's contested regulations, for example, is the mandatory addition of biofuels to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the shadow guide the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to a considerable increase in egg prices this year.
It has been criticised for the fact that the expression "mantequila de entar" or the removal of the classic bubble of trades has been used.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 cm.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, including with the threat of veto, claims the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that top-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission has defended itself by saying that it seeks only to harmonise national non-harmonised standards so far, which have only complicated its marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU requirement last year that in the inflatable worlds that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflam without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, the globes are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction applicable to the use of mammals by children up to 14 years of age is also in force.
Interesting events are even born in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To avoid hurting Greece's sensitivity, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, appointed in the survey, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies available in the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for preserved silk, which was a threat of substantial fine.
Organizers of the survey were also interested in paying those countries that had no access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the request for grants.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're in a disadvantage because we don't have any water.
We have asked the European Union for compensation," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that there was a lot of grain in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stores and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development directed by Minister Pavel Niemec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often clear criticisms, EU regulatory efforts and, in addition, more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fiber, as are other countries in the Union, by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these wars.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc's requisition, but had to change their name to the national run, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became "tuzemák".
Only products produced from the sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar cane.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, along with the well-known feta and gorgonzol cheeses around the world, the German city of Lübeck or the hammock of Parma, for example, are the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the Pohorelice carp and Treboň and, even, the variety of Žatec lupus.
As well as protecting marines from the EU, they may be proud of the Pardubice wine bread and the boats from Horjice v Podkrkkonoshí.
People want to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Mr Senator, how did you get the election to the president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in the last 20 years in our country, how thieves are being punished, taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to give a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon it has been headed for the presidency.
Aren't you giving the back to those people who voted for it?
I always said that my application to the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I specified that if I was elected senator, I would submit my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the TV, but that we tread on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is accompanied by the media, which despises you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I'm told that I've bribed journalists what I've been counseling for Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
The presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership of over twenty million is presented.
For that, the law must be changed.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure for the leadership to be recognized as self-employed, and we have succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether from the right or from the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to obtain support from all parliamentary groups.
Without censorship or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is it a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people think I'm more than left-handed.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we get out of here.
I don't care if anyone is on the right or on the left, I want to join people.
Always support openly any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
It's funny when it's said that you're a populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you're saying?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without Parliament's support, there are only signs.
And this cannot survive long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will, for example, get a criminal and financial liability?
I don't have another choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my side to achieve it.
If the President were elected, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that points to the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take the President's direct election, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals, I'm trying to find allies.
I have just started in politics and I am trying to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I try to get things out myself, but if it doesn't work out well, within six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not doing anything with a person, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, because they're best encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For me, at least I have supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself from the base that people are really unhappy, now I'm in the balance.
The 60 per cent of the population did not turn to the polls and, those who did, voted on the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time for this, to check the untraceable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't have any money or for the presidency campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
He's talking about property statements, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a rated land of 25 million, a rated floor of ten million, another floor of eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Super-Skoda scored in a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant to women and, at the same time, was fighting evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that you don't have any sponsor shows that there's not too much interest in my program.
And I don't have to pay the campaign with my pocket money.
The campaign's costs are essentially what I'm going to get as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only wanted to earn money, then I wouldn't present myself as a candidate.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say before I was going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a bigger salary.
As I promised, in part I have left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in spring.
People would like me to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How much do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I still win.
If I were president, then I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic aspect, and there is something interesting to see at last," says Lisette Verhaig, a transeont passing the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
Nobody likes to enter those old fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping city located at the gates of Rotterdam that only deserves a runaway visit, shows the dubious honor of being raised with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of decorated armed concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was as politicians decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of bar charts and responsible for fun and cynic buildings, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was looking around and looking at his shoulders, Maas proceeded to grab the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: "Dear fellows:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain rises in the expected place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and nursing buildings.
In early November the book mountain was awarded the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also appointed to the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
Thus, the small city with no history, which so far had nothing more than to offer that a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town after whose white facade one would rather perceive a milk center, now has a contemporary architecture work.
But above all, Spijkennie now has the first public cultural building of its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a queser.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this mountain masso, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to blend with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glassed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the soil of the collected brick and the elegant flags clearly support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can see the park's banks, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And on all sides books, books and more books.
"Really book sheets are available along the façade and in the centre there is a huge dark room that is usually something uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put your feet on the classic space configuration and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: there are offices in the middle, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room.
Special mention is due to the black sheets that assume the functions of wall, parapet and wall covering at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We would like to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, in a fresh agricultural holding, we meet with the right sub-product from agriculture.
For many years, a plastic fabric of very few millimetres of thickness has been used in winter and in the Netherlands as a basis for subjecting the roots of crops.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library, this fabric was taken for the first time in such quantities up to reach plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sports shoes.
After 105 pulds it reaches the top of the mountain.
At the end of this route, almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café there is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also in it you can enjoy a delicious Dutch crochet and its ficus planted in huge machetes.
These create a pleasant atmosphere for the pair that maintains the proper atmospheric humidity for this literature mountain.
Donations for a New Soul
"Although it is expensive to believe it given its large crystallized surfaces, this building is an example project with regard to ecology," Trouborst points out.
The required heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden rings located cross-sectionally to the crystal facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable inner climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic Persians.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, Chinese traditional medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, due to the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical hooks of a library that still does not have its full file; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has been silent for a long time.
The sheets are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative, all inhabitants now have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Although he's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all success in this queen discipline that in the specialized argument is known as "the creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenie has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of the young man and innocent what he can be.
Finally a starting point to match your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany agreed that it would vote against the proposal to grant the status of observer status of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a flight ban zone.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is due to the fact that it is now reorientating its foreign policy, away from a leading policy, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what is even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Thus, the Germans are in a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they're still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, stands ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the vote of the United Nations?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful not to deviate from the Arab public opinion or from the Arab elite.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give you so much importance as it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in the German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a dramatic collapse as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to earn some respect.
After all, all this has not done but to demonstrate that it is a country seriously taken as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
Instead, the United States has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed due to US internal policy.
I believe that Obama's government has a great understanding of the European position in secret.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the magnitude attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not excited about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it has with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the attitude of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the opportunity to be part of a superior body, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will take a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, it is simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a pragmatic topic.
But I think that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or is it still hard for him to accept that leadership?
Germany has not become accustomed, it is always a bit uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are being removed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude toward the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the United States in European politics is increasing, but the EU does not currently cover that gap, who is left?
Germans will have no more remedy than to assume a more protagonist role.
Even if they don't like it, if it makes them uncomfortable or if it makes them a more unpopular people, it's life!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-famous brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name a name officially registered in China is hidden but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this enjoyment of protection while the true eponomies do not present a claim.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them reason.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing Bufe, who specializes in violations of rights of protection in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The simulators simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports articles Puma.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which he holds seats from the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company asked to register the brand Zenga DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zenga.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is a well-known thing.
In large cities there are large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. Because of its clients, he fights against the fact that the brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears, and the damage the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year China is, in size, the third market in luxury goods and growing at a higher rate.
However, the cancellation of registrations of questionable legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and entails a lot of money.
The process can be extended for up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had spent so much time that the subject name of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the complainant is lucky, he may even have to pay money to the complainant because the process has damaged the mark of the complainant in China," Pattloch points out.
Sometimes this is the law of the forest.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that had been absorbed recently by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete bombs.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo, which largely reminded BMW; the case was addressed in the courts, and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against copyrs from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking at the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 there have been difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the situation of work emergency has returned to normal."
Thus, the number of untreated claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and it means that China will lead the list of new registrations worldwide for a decade, as the brand office points out.
This also seems to be happening with the number of valid logos, a figure of 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been disbursed in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1.280 yuan or 160 euro.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as evidenced by the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copycat.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the simulator has managed to ensure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because the names are not protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also dismissed the use of the munitions.
In the following two instances they have given Freudenberg the reason, but the opposite is still fighting at present.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where a resolution is pending.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the issue and commend the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files of up to 100 years of age in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite "sum of six figures in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but was not successful.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler says.
The dangers facing the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if copyrs are assured there of the rights on unprotected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
A long time ago the group left this trading area, but managed to prevent registration.
"We must be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both him and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on brand rights, but what we have to do is "to register in China all that can be protected", as Wentzler points out.
On the contrary, the subject can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg loses the last attack of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the party the contrary license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi choir and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice
The history of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
It begins with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, taco shoes and mocasines seek the compass on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers begin to rise slowly (contrary, low, tenor and soprano), shaking, stuttering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out almost from his boxing when trying to order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the choir Imbongi is trying a new song.
The 50 singers, from 23 to 69 years of age, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a well-known foreign language: the zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS Control Programme has around 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa association has found patrons in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the town of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, a child can be accommodated.
This contribution will cover the school's record, uniform and ensure a hot meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "history storytelling" or "panegirist."
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this buntu language, but singing does know.
For ten years, this choir has been trying songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 km of straight-line distance from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the Kingdom of Suaziland, there is a village called Esitnie which depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some in simple clay and pajamas, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitje is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see with good eyes circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of contamination by half.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are immunodeficiency virus carriers, and dying with something more than thirty years has become a habitual thing.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this returning population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who were not only the protection of their parents, but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, the opportunities in a poor country are more than rare.
In principle, it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a warm meal every day.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally occupied by AIDS orphans in Esitnie.
Committed on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial-origin ETS are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral ETS are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sarna are located between the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected people?
The syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who maintain sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (Hongo) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, about 20% of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, Chillidia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has remained a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were reported.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms do they indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, nausea during urine, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or vertebrates.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of contamination, but do not offer protection to the hundred per cent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirty infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change frequently as a sexual partner.
If early diagnosis is performed, most ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations, and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for its actions throughout Germany are getting a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitje," said proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman herself and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
The orphans are taking care to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "gogos", as called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof where to live and make sure that children come to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who do not have anyone are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, has built two hens, and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has succeeded in many of the people's HIV testing.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patent that this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually spoken of openly.
A King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted form of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless times that travel the country from one side to the other and that they take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "on any corner you can get free condoms, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here only accept skin contact against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost end of the African continent still remember the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings you an excellent environment and a lot of joy, but has also managed to lift a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitni, where the singers visit the children who are abstinent.
Although this small population only appears on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is very well known.
"Come to Esitnie, there the light shines," the people of the place said.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight-line back to Heidelberg to the trial rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The Messenger survey has found evidence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the closest planet to the sun, there is also cold water, as it appears from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shade.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in their day shocked Mercurio.
No one relates the finding of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the Sensenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, findings could help clarify how water and other life components have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unwary for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that form our solar system, in addition to the planet, enamo Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Telescope Spitzer shows a "family portrait" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "born newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, called in a little romantic way by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Telescope Spitzer in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This isolated image of an extinction star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut ring is made up of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the huge Nebula Trifida, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture from the Galactic Star Training Zone.
The Pléyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Nebula of the Helica appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrared.
It is located at 700 light years of Aquario constellation.
Its similarity to an earthly continent has validated the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a colorful spectacular.
This star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn's months that disappeared without leaving a trail of 4,500 million years ago.
One of the largest and most neat photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Galaxy of the Remolino.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years in the Sagitario constellation.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark dust lines divide the burning heart of this star formation area into three lobes.
At the constellation of Ofiuco the astronomers were able to photograph the indications of a cosmic carabola: at 400 million light years of Earth the nucleuss of two galaxies in fusion process are suspended to one another to end irremediable shock.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to her with the nickname of the Australian Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Nebula Iris in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebula at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographics made by various telescopes.
Shows a black hole ring located at 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, known as Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star formation area constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rose Nebula, are also constantly emerging new stars; to 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brilliant galaxy with a small black hole, there's no dust yet, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is raised.
It allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this most economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to pick up light.
Despite having a relatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI for its English stamps) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the Eastern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here comes the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also welcome the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
By 2018, images are not expected to be taken.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
From 24 April 1990 he sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are inhabited.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 global candidates had been located since the beginning of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 to 2018 rocket.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers depart from the basis that ice is also present in the southern shelf of Mercurio.
However, there is no evidence, since the Messenger probe rotates around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger 2004 survey, the first to orbit around Mercurio, now scientists are sure to do so.
Drinking butter daily and living 168 years

A search for marks in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be called wild and romantic.
The minibus progresses with great strept through the sinuosa road that passes next to forest hills, rivers of large valley and the simple houses of local farmers.
It's all green and juicy, you might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here the "talyshi" live, a people who don't know much, except that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azerbaijani and that they are very distant.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city assumes of an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and that it does not seem to fit completely in a mountain landscape so picturesque.
European tourists only reach this place, as the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too heavy.
The 323 km that separates both urban cores takes eight hours because the road is one way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this rich region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what you need to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva points out.
It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis from the place that have passed the 100 years. Fatulayeva points out a picture in black and white.
This is my grandfather, who lived for 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been mistaken then in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registration.
Every day bottles full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Bible age.
Currently, there are 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do they live here, in the south, so many elderly people?
The Azeri tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the rich food in the calorie of the talyshi, who worship meat, bread and especially milk products, and many of which, in addition, drink daily a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or is it the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Ruba Mirzayeva.
At age 97, it is relatively young for what it is all about.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house in the entire Caucasian region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves tirelessly a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, one of them sons and one of Mirzayeva's daughters, both became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play on one side to the other two little children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that is served in a typical glass with an abundance of water.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the panel hides two long pieces of dark blonde hair that his son discovers us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and kept your color.
"I've never used a shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always only eaten what he produced in his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and guisantes.
I've never gone shopping for a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the postwar World War II.
However, everything went back to its tail when the "Dear Father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of a bigger woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the worship of the nation's fatherly figure, which governs his country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This was held in power until 2003, the moment the witness gave his son Ilham.
At least the older persons in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking account of the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son-in-law is right: "In our culture the older ones are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is alluded.
The future constitution, with the Sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president didn't waste his time on Patatism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the secular ones.
All of them, unmedied so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
I fear a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate title awarded by the University of South California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by an assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamic members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does "principles" mean?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that has appeared, to impose a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new article added: in all matters relating to Sharia, it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunny Islamism.
It does not matter why it is, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the inability of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that he intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exert a severe repression of the opposition.
After the dictator's death, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the drafter states, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morality and values".
It is such an inaccurate wording in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Speaking of which, of course, it is nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, it is forbidden to offend or slander the Prophet Mohammed and his legions.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equal to doubt is the formulation that prohibits "opposition to people"
Is it enough for the president's caricature or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
Weeks ago the opposition was closing rows against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir del Cairo and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who takes the third place in the list of presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and Ex-Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft of the constitution should be "in the cube of the trash of history".
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a state coup against democracy.
"When the referendum is convened, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been shed," the Egyptian politician Chaled Ali quoted himself as saying in the media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestation; if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi to "clean the country", at the same time as they proclaimed: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers said that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their high and clear views.
Now would be the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamic eraser has guaranteed most.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were detained in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," she laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State led this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Outa feels abandoned, also by the international community, which notes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestor in Tahrir Square warns: "You are designing a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: is the world's most illustrative fish?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the largest living standards, not just in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success will preserve some relationship with its greed for a very melancholy fish?
Take a series of excessively curated cheeses.
Place them in the midst of a dirty and wet football mountain.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralysing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is tricked in salmon that is let fermented in water for a while, depending on the melancholy you prefer, up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, the Norwegians flock to a festival that is celebrated here in Fagernes, dedicated to this meal of the most, so to speak, capitivator.
"You eat raw and then drink a pot of aquavit from a towel," says Havard Halvarsen, a city bomber who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
On the other hand, we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking important quantities of drink.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," said Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a piece of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
The rakfisk is a product from a very different time, in which poverty took place in Norway and in which, before the refrigeration existed, the fish was kept during the submerged autumn in water and salt in hermetical barrels.
Later, in the winter, when it is already well fermented, it is extracted and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mostly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of residents of Sweden, the old rival and even makes not much more rich than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be an important part of Norway's past, although quite unfavourable.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A can of beer or a sandwich costs you the 10€ fridge ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news, and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still not ready to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22".
The Norwegians find it most costly to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth there is growth, from the beginning of the 70s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," said Anna, our comrade, as she passed rakfisk flags and that, with her long red apple and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
Your English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like flashing, we don't like flashing."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution; everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
While the whole world was wasting money that it did not have during the years that preceded the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the ticket well closed.
"As we can ski in winter and make hiking in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a loaded development.
I'm in the snow doing cocoon to eat something; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now a high hamburger is certainly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, he returns to that poor fish.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which the comincials vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most testes the nose pits.
A TV has connected live to a presenter who wears pajamarita and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fishing up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are laughs and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the steams of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take over his post, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, has since Monday installed a steel circle that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the nation's management.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been gaining good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war on drug trafficking that has been charged some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment with the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before he co-ordinated with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populous and fast-growing state that surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bustling town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are reminded with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads can be driven, which is a huge improvement compared to the steep roads and full of bays that have been rehabilitated.
You can also see plates with their name at the entrance of a modern multi-sport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, MP of Mr Peña Nieto's party, PRI.
"Partly, as far as security and economy are concerned, we expect the interesting and real change our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was released by Vicente Fox in 2000.
MEP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party with regard to Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the claim that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He's a very sincere, very committed man with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other hand, that state is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast to the well-adjusted streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway tracks is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico's own city.
And the problems in the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than the one in Juárez City, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, in the best case, that I did not know how to deal with the problem of feminism while in office.
The most critical accuses your administration of making the fat view.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorating neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I came to her house, it seemed as if they had cleaned her body," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and the strict mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, along with a cross where a single word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says she has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like an old chismus, an abbotator, a queer.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up."
"But that can't be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential party that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says Pri Olvera MP in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of the City of Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't report bad treatment, the prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's abuse complaints while in prison.
The trial focuses on the period of Manning in Quantico's military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the highest filtration of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military arrest.
During the investigation that the prosecutor conducted in Manning in a pre-trial view in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein said that the records of the weekly visits of officials of the unit that Manning received for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a vision carried out on the basis of the defence's request that the case be dismissed because its imprisonment had been hard and that it had already suffered enough punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In the view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled after Manning's visits during his arrest in Quantico's military prison, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officials would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the celeators as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although officials asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officials visiting him had talked about those issues and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they had not made any comment on those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'unincidence' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not complained about the treatment he received during the January 2011 meeting with a counsel to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a previous form.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was under.
The military said that it had been placed under that restrictive regime, which was a degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, in order to ensure its protection and security for other persons.
"I wanted the biggest state to know that I was good and (I wanted) to stop being under the prevention of injuries... to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison based in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost his knowledge because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he would not be allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to the Arafjon camp, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that after moving to Quantico, most days spent in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a spoon, a blanket, a scarf, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even to fall asleep during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming out pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the waiters couldn't see his face when he was back at night, they woke him up so he could come back.
In January 2011, Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint on Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday the judge asked Manning about an argument he had made in the statement on Thursday, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to remain naked in front of the cells and other prisoners during a morning account.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the account.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he was deducing the order given to him by the cellist who should have let the blanket fall with which he could have been covered, but admitted that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he might have used the elastic of his inner clothes or his self-healing ankles but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed from their cell their inner clothing, their ankles and their glasses.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account the experiences he had experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduced his sentence in case he was convicted in the council of war, which is expected to begin at the beginning of the coming year.
The defence said it intended to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and to defend other accusations considered too extreme.
The view is expected to resume this weekend and the prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application to any detainee who is under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illicitly triggering the publication of information on the Internet, filtration of information from national defence and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face a permanent chain.
My Mexican-US identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who went; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just fallen down the road and arrived at the immigration treatment area and was already completely confused.
Some signposts indicated the way to two tails: one for "Mexicons" and the other for "foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was supposed to go.
When I grew up in Central California, they've been calling me "Mexicon."
It's an ethnic tachograph, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends as "Italian" themselves.
Later I decided to "Mexicon-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, the tachygraphy or script was not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish, as well as to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself on the line of foreigners.
I thought this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, as long as the leaders of these two countries are gathered, it was stated: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wishing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is so likely that a Mexican stays in Mexico at this time that he will be able to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a trade block in the European Union style in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to surrender half of their territory to the point of gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, at the moment when a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctzuma are at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a whole challenge is that of the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point of our genealogical tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or any of the grandparents, to whom the door to the opportunities in Mexico was closed and had to go north.
And most of the time that person fit in a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, from a poor people, etc.
We are his descendants and we are loyal.
Mexico doesn't.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Our identity may not be clear at times, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many of the Mexicans who belong to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still like lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that this rock exists between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first ones know with greater strength who they are and the second ones this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered a member of the two countries.
In the meantime, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del North, but also Bruce Springstein.
You have the best in each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico you see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect to the diaspora again.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised ambassadors of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American comrades how fantastic it is to visit that country and press the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be alone with this idea, guys.
You're right.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still reciprocated by how they treated their families much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood flow that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and common debates about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to taste or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional alborote.
Maybe this will make your fight even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons to believe that their fatal death situation could be resolved.
A War That Neither Loses nor Wins
At first sight, optimism seems currently very difficult to justify.
Even if the fires agreed on 21 November were to be maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the halons of both bands.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good strike.
And despite killing some of their leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous reefs on the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays for them.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the wealthiest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The successful Hamas members say that the middle Islamic month is around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbula militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamic trend could defeat Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Above all in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamás.
On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are Hamas' cousins and their leaders depend more on the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist to which even Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
In the meantime, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
The Israeli Cup of Hierro's anti-missile system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quietly... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended up with the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of an aspiracy territory to become a state of Palestine, and it protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that international legislation has been illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why bite those Palestinian turtles by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they shoot rockets like they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their head.
Perhaps the harsh wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could change its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere have little regard for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire out is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is supposed to create a powder that will one day operate in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics is worsening as the Arab population increases.
The gruesome missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic salary.
Both gangs need a push from outside the conflict.
The solution remains to be the one who prays for people of both sides, the majority of the outside world and this journal: two states and Israel's territorial assignment for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to the foreign people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to put a stop to the entry of weapons in Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also had an important role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term of office, he ignored his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems as reticent to devote your attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
General Tobacco Package Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on boxes of a green black, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian Tobacco and Generic Package Act, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by a wrapper of a green olive evaporate, a wonderful images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies ill because of being children of smoking parents.
Except for the various pictures and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a kind of small source.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to the tobacco package.
The federal government of Australia states that the aim is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the features that make this habit glamour.
It trusts studies that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is 99 per cent of the possibility that he will never do so.
"It can be seen that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put a lot of pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that will be brought by the facilitators from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited since the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for bottles and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired almost two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal of the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to majorist establishments and was expecting more stocks.
"For us it's a good deal."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot be restricted on foreign websites.
"If you trade tobacco and just stay this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increase of reviews on brands from "foot citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It should be asked whether it is only a private citizen who really likes Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco from Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new legislation implies than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unduly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, more stringent laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"Photos don't affect me.
I simply don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Creationally, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack at the centre of Sydney, says that the uniform boxes make it more complicated for him to put them in the cabinets.
"It usually took an hour to unload a delivery; now it is late four," Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, it's, well, it's over and we're closing the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get bored a little bit
During this year's Thanksgiving Day parties, I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boring.
I'm not gonna lie to them.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But there are increasingly academic and child development experts who praise the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, at present, most of us are connected to this or to that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we gladly accept boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, he assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The Borrowing, An Animated History") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, it is not so.
"In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom dating back to the 1st century C.E.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and putting the idea before a panel of discussion consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desire, but not power, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
She points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, says, is "the change in the care process, associated with a low state of mind and a sense that time passes slowly".
Tiredness can sound awfully similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that the problem has them.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have problems to concentrate on.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened in the next room to a television program at any volume that had no connection, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was only perceived, while the third group did not hear the audio at any time.
The group that heard the program with the volume below showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the shift of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a line of manufacture, a music that distracts you can help you not to be bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or doing garabats, actions that often are interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to be bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
In order to help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of tendency to boredom".
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and they actually need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 per cent of adolescents said that he would be bored while he was at school or doing homework, while 23 per cent said that he would be bored when he was not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would be bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current abortion rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "adultness is a period when boredom reaches its highest rates", largely because both children and adolescents are not given a great deal of control over what they want to do.
So, returning to my question of principle: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taking to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way you have the brain to say that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, it'll satisfy you.
But if you see television, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to do so," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he said.
Your son not only learns to entertain himself by himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really wanted to praise boring.
But neither should we be overly critical of him.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable parts of the constant voice of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a very anxious and worrying desire as to relate it to something that deserves the punishment," he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colored: no instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community and soccer institute in southwest Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove to Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and soon Orozco received a court quote for possession of drugs and related articles (administrative crimes involving each 100 US dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the holding of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor cases of drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes for possession of marijuana are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to submit charges against the 21-year-olds by small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with cases open for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from Denver's suburbs to western mountains, are voting to prevent shops of marijuana, recently authorised in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are responsible for the regulations in Washington state are also returning to the matter.
They continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale licences; all of this before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead with most states regarding the regulation of the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
"There is no real precedent that serves us as a model," he says.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which to swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but ownership will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to provide "adequate access" to the authorized marijuana and its prohibition of undertaking cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or kindergartens.
"In no place will it be more difficult to place an authorised cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a research group recently created.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would stop bringing legal proceedings for minor violations of marijuana possession to persons older than 21 years of age and that the police would stop bringing charges against such crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for implementing the city's rules governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute drug dealers and drug dealers.
In the county of Weld, in northern Colorado, the district prosecutor, Ken Buck, represents a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he assured his office that it would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and that they were determined to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to intervene in judicial action against those offences that were criminal at the time they occurred," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest county town, no longer cites adults for having small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, the county prosecutor, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases by possession.
"I don't think you're wasting your time by continuing to enforce the law until this change," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system was easy.
Contradictive reactions occurring throughout the state show a marked ambivalentity among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
"It is a cultural barrier with the district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the accused of possession of marijuana and who is the local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"They've been taking us so long before the courts that, in fact, they can't yet accept it as legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become test cases at the national level with regard to drug law.
While lawyers and state officials have a new border of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving instructions from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will resign.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of marijuana patients and sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed most of its sales of marijuana to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although it is likely that drug agents will not pull down the doors to confiscate a small drug bag, reactions will probably be shown to allow the operation of state-regulated shops for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted by the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an overdose of the Obama administration's drug policy.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it would be about a year before any of them could open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a town member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted in favour of what the state voted in favour of."
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was beaten up by Oxford for being a Tory."
He doesn't attack the university for his views only now
I don't remember any time in my life I haven't dreamed of getting a place at Oxford University.
My father and my older brother had been in which I assumed it was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks of occupying my place at the Worcester College in the late 1980s, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father fell apart and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper said that I had abandoned because it was not tolerated that some college colleagues had sexual relations in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in unscrupulous cups.
The truth was less fun.
Get out of there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because it came from a private school.
They argued to me for a single reason, which in the cone of the alleged illustration turned out to be something intolerant and barbarous: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what's going on now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students from the right centre is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students is such that last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights for homosexuals, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of grade students) of the Corpus Christi College affirm that they are "often seriously, personally attacked and treated as not free people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the equality committee of their university college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wunderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on students' policy and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lighting a plated suit and a stick with silver push.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "turkey heads" because of the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is an increasing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, who is the elected President of OUCA, says that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards the right-wing people has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I went to college in September 1986, she was a young 18-year-old terribly shy.
The hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, an old student, a title "honoris cause" after cuts in funding for higher education.
The environment would have spooked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students get to know and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.
I found that not only did the cathedrals make a bold view of the mofa that was made of conservative universities, but they were happy to participate in it.
The policy of the strike of miners, the privatisation and opposition of the government to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminary.
At first I attended, French texts of the 18th century were to be translated into English, and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Señorita Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I don't know one.
Pitt, a man down with a face that looked like a bizzoch mass, knew well how to eject bad biles.
"Is it that the thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other university students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you're not too busy knowing people," Pitt shouted.
I returned to my room as a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at dinner at the university; then I felt a light palm on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James, who was introduced as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They're messing with anyone who's suspicious of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Many Tories recently arrived to appear to be laborers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardlyly to dissimulate.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student in Philosophy, Politics and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I've become the perverted dirt.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"You give each other a thumb, don't you?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after the nightfall?
Would you have to make me a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I was expecting were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
Tory's only open cathedral was Norman Stone, professor of Contemporary History for my university college.
They hated him because he was not only the Conservative party, but also thatcher's advisor in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was only there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because he adhered to the Marxist-Determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of the most open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father that he hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dreams needles.
Even my Communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
I'd break my heart if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his belief.
The following week, during a seminar in which another cathedral of History had insinuated, speaking completely seriously, that I was a "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "old stupid."
The truce took little time.
It was my father who put the last key in my college career at Oxford.
That's when my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was in a hurry of fear and, last five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When the suitcase was made and I took the first train in London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party, but, to this day, it is hidden behind a reputation of nothing worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
Due to the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which has been inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the opening of "Valentino: Master of the Costura", a retrospective apothesist that gathers more than 130 tall costume dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colphon of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but it could not have been written without its distinguished customers.
Valentine has always had a sense of fascination with the distant and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until the next 3 March, there are many private letters and photos with the signature of the most granite of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: of humble humility in the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the icon of the international "get-set".
Being in love with reality has nothing to do with it.
"At least they don't delete the collars of their pistols on your magnificent carpet as they make some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and maintains generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet at Gstaad," explains the exhumer of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, shining a Valentine
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the modest.
Many years ago, after a show in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on her floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costume Week in Paris in 1995.
"Never goes fashion because your designs are works of art," he says.
Alcurnia Show
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-recorded love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long gateway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to slide through the gateway to contemplate a "hearing" dream that shines in Valentine's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, the dress that Monica Vitti used in "La Night", or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Farah Diba Emperor.
In that public of manicures they highlight names such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the modest, in 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable to forget."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a jacket "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love to women, because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duke of Fairy.
I like the colors you use, have great light and are "donors" on your face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovapaola d'Arenbergtampo can not forget the first time she saw Valentine.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of coming to have the age and the opportunity to use one of his nightwear...
Finally, the time arrived at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a fold of wings, "corsage" flagged and heard a word of honor.
"It was a dream made real," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dress of the modest party with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it's also the set of memories she wears."
The "king" of fashion
The great end of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul de Greece in 1995.
Four months of work were needed and 25 "girls" (as the modest calls their ribs) were needed to develop that silk marfil suit with pearl incrustations, twelve different types of fitting and a four-metre-and-a-half-metre tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the maximum authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a hit from the high sewing of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnubated for years with the "savour-savour" of the elite, now Valentino is his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Laboro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion de Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always called me attention to his refinement, his calmness, his bright and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The toughest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by loading 70 kg of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom your work is a hell and another who, literally, work in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sugar from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this end, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the earth’s guts is strengthened when contacting the air.
After starting big sugar rocks, which total up to about 70 kilos, they are loaded in two bamboo baskets carrying on their shoulders through rocky trails.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters high, but the wearers' exhausts take more than 40 minutes to climb a tortoise step, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to shake and fall down the precipitation.
They know that any trapeze could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was dumped years ago because of the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents Euros per pound of sulphur that extract
Once above, there is a passage between the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys of the circus and, tirelessly loading heavy canasts, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) per kilogram of sulphur.
Then it is sold by 10,000 rupees (83 centimum euros) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is generalized in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual, we carry 70 kilos, we pull out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily doors.
Three hours later each and it ends in a wet state, but it allows you to gather 138,000 rupees (€11.5) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what I would win in the field.
"The newspaper of miners is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid to 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2) on the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167)," explains the carrier, who previously worked as an Albanian on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the tajo was not so hard, but then he returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, turns out to be as overwhelming as the sulphur: "I married a young Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought it to Java to convert to Islam."
Then he has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases
At 27 years of age, then he takes three playing the fight in the Kawah Ijen, whose sugar has already begun to pass his bill despite having to cover his face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that discharge the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," she promises in a more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice young and smart one could be a tourist guide, a roommate or a receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other bearers, it rises every day to the two of the morning because the sugar does not stop driving at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defining the shadows, then lowering the crater with a little flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers load the sugar basket on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its narrow benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs, nor provides any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and on both weights.
In fact, it is not even part of the 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) of recharge by camera, which, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who go to photograph the volcano and their human mules.
"This work is for animals and not for people," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving college.
He is able to raise up to 110 pounds, assures that he will continue to work "everything he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and listens to the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of having serious diseases... there, of course it is, of their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and joints in the shoulders, which have been damaged by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on your back, Unainik can already load only 50 kilos at its 53 years old.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulphur into the volcano, which three trucks transfer to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away along a path of goats between the male.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where he lacks a number of teeth.
Of his five children, the older, of 30 years old, also works with sugar.
Time passes, but the eternal misery of generation is one of the toughest offices in the world: that makes the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks to save the economy
Singaporens blame the race, the stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we do our civic duty and we believe in life!
It may seem inverse that these verses are part of an advertisement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "We're going to put a bath (bottle) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hosts the hope that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "his national duty".
This is pure Internet stuff, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast-dating candles.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to make up a rap?
1.2 children
What doesn't take so lightly is Singapore's government.
It spends US$1,300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently in place in 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as a retirement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage Policy and Family of the National Population Division, says it is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to the delay of marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to address the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia abounds only spread against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticised for keeping low wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the government party in Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and recordings for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has been controlling the number of small apartments, known as a "slip box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have areas of 46 square meters and have had a lot of success in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that their shoes are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted for days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
It admits, however, that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers, which were previously put to work if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to the Singaporeans working in the financial district of the similar centre that will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are face-to-face, and so is education, so many people are putting it off," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to count on my own money and time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, for as long as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, the Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private offline is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Dictionary of the Royal Academy, it is the quality of private or "the scope of private life which is entitled to protect from any introduction".
What is private for a less than 16 years?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and in your social networks?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by ventilating online situations that would probably not be shared online?
thePeriodic interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the key and user name", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't go up to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the private meaning of sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I picked up beautiful pictures or games.
I'm also interviewing my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that isn't mine, or someone who's making the joke," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscenity photographs of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I open Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just going up them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
No doubt he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to anyone recommending a stranger.
Joseph's 14-year-old case is different.
The adolescent has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest admission not to know 20 of the people aggregated in his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has insinuated him or asked him for the address of his home or phone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded me just the bags of my account," he admits.
José followed Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not strange from the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was evicting him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who I was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"I only gave you privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload pictures of acquaintances in uncomfortable or pregnant situations.
Yes, I would, if I'm sick or I'm hungry.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he said.
Perras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the Native and Digital Immigrant Work, met these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we need to teach them, while we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the subject is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what it should or should not spread, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for it."
"Even if they are selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach what privacy is for children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflective.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," she adds.
Then, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it online?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you as you have published from a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When you tag photos of parties, did you ask permission for other people to tag them?
And one more, do they all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them see that they have to act on line as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"An outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, it must also be on social networks," he says.
Watch
Esturdo Guardia, a university professor, professor of primary education, and educational consultant, notes that it is essential that family parents read the policies of social networks in their minds.
In understanding each of the paragraphs, they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".
Finalize the Summit of the Union without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of the United Nations (Unasur) has today concluded in Peru without the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant mandatearies.
Efé tried to access the document signed at the VI Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancellor and Presidency indicated at the outset that it would be delivered after the closure, but then stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only, the unsound video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The few information he circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons from some of the Governments of the U.S. Assistant, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which resulted in hundreds of journalists being harassed by various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was Humala's statement, not the official document that closed the summit.
In October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of South America (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being strongly demanded by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration had not been circulated.
The official website of ASPA confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to have secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited the maximum information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure of the Hague Court to establish a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which began Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations from both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will accept and execute the judgment defining the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with her Chilean couple.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country in respect of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they will submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia this week denouncing the Bogotá Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the proceedings of that international court, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host President, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the mid-day of Lima.
He read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects among South American countries had been established for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he said that UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residence agreements".
It reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, internet access at low prices in all parts of South America, and to respond jointly and efficiently to the risks of natural disasters".
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and to see a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reintegrate the South American Union", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to be maintained as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he was hoping to meet with his couple from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime difference in respect of a case by the CIJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"On the morning (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We're going to review all these paths, they're not exclusive, including the Nicaragua treaty will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell you that we manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they planned to attend the leadership of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the block's defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the area of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now I am practically a country".
In that regard, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship that encourages the member countries of the south.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved by any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also showed support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of undermining the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give the cathedral are never committed to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," said the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured her that she was not regretful of that decision because it did not betray her principles but respected her "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were grounded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and did not respect its process".
He also criticised Swedish justice for demanding that they be interrogated in their territory for alleged sexual crime when "Swedish legislation allows it to be carried out through videoconferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa claimed that there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health is deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian envoy said.
What there is is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are trapped in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe conduct allowing it to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there had been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures in different European institutions," he said.
And he thought, "if Britain tomorrow he's safe-conducting this is over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow this problem is over.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and argued that what she did not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil faith and the lie that distorts freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists according to profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, it was welcomed that these journalists are no longer "no longer the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries who dominate Ecuador", and it has been suggested that if they are re-elected, "it will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto in Paraguay at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and covered golf" because it actually "destructed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered the "perfectly relevant" wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the fall of the Hague International Court of Justice, which benefited from Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
There is no such failure at the moment.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We need to process them in a broad way to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute held in the same court of Peru and Chile and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries undertake to accept failure as hard as possible".
Referring to the possibility presented as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if she loses the commissions of February 2013 she will withdraw from public life.
In staff I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and from there we're out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan vice president Nicolas Maduro and he tells me he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to go through the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the health state of President Chávez," he commented.
The head of the Ecuadorian State today participated in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if a bomb fell on me," he said, remembering the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more gentle", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness and began to inform himself about it; with such effort he had already celebrated his birthdays 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, to the director of a IMSS clinic, he avoided saying, "Because he brought a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, unaware of your disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "aborted" its immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, at least in the first cases reported, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV head Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was used in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infecttologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: from up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that the person who receives the HIV positive diagnosis at 25 years of age, under these terms "while maintaining control, he can live without problems until 75 years of age", the interviewer explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
Only 255 people in Jalisco died in 2011, and 187 deaths to May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why is there still death?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I view it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a lack of medication the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their condition of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said: "Nine out of every ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what they have to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnosiss and therefore they have to offer mass detection tests to all people who require it."
In its proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to test themselves to a particular laboratory, were motivated only because a friend had done it and, despite his short age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from sarcoma from Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die now, I'd better go back three times a week," they say, "not in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I care for myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his witness those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
To test, if they had a risk, that sooner or later they know if they are HIV positive, it's better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the motto of the battle on AIDS this 2012.
Condons behind the display
Big are the jokes between health programs and the common citizen, Ricardo Salazar, a tapatio journalist who has taken the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that's very good but it turns out that there are people today, still, who don't have access to a condom," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sour and value-of-value judgments of social workers, school mentors, pharmacists and health personnel, to whom adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator assured them.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only follow the indicators and these hundreds are found in public bathrooms from sites that are frequented by young people.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a matter of paying the keys and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if he would have made reservations in his administration.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to approach condoms who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated AIDS cases and 13th HIV.
92% of the contagion corresponds to the sexual path, 6% to the blood path, and 2% to the perinatal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV because there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it by a recorded case.
Ratified by a U.S. Appeals Court a judgment that does not know the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group through a commercial contest in Mexico, the scenario puts a bad precedent for any national firm with branching in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures at the bottom of the survival of signatures allowing Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the spade to the judgment issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankcarrotas court for the northern district of Texas, leaves no defence to Mexican firms in view of the possibility of decommissioning their properties in the district of Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to approach the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
On entry, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Breaks Act, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the commercial competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would imply noting international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law was set up to that end, by adjudicating the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of the inter-company, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts of the Vitro subsidiaries with their matrix would not have been achieved by the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrirex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-company debts have been dropped by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth is, while remaining the votes of the subsidiaries, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved most.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data omits the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this guilt to Vitro of the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 to the relief of the serious economic crisis that he faced in the United States, by catching up with the country.
Soon, the signing of the González Sada family will bring a review appeal before the Court of Appeal itself for the vote to be completed, namely the five judges, given that they voted only three.
If it does not prosper, it will be claimed that Cerciarare's appeal requires a review of the proceedings by a superior body, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious case is that the court signed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friends curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing Vitro's proceedings under the Mercantial Competitions Act, noting that this document was disassociated from the conventions signed by both countries to implement it under Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is, the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carabol: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General's Balance
Sleeped for several months the complaints placed on the table by the Mexican Aviation Unions against the company's ex-wife, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, has already found the bottle neck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal claim against the National Banking and Values Commission against whom the accused of obstruction to justice is charged.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from Bank IXE's F/589 trust, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million weights.
Resources would have been channelled to purchase shares from the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Search Dragon Mart
Assembled on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal center of sale and distribution of products from the country of the wall in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, with a calcium housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the south-east zone to oppose the monumental thing that had taken root in part of protected areas and raised the mother of all the shelters against the industry.
ACTA died
Underlining a request by the Government of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Commercial Agreement, known for its English-language stamps as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already passed to the file.
As you know, the action was made despite the fact that the Senate itself had dequalified the possibility of considering it as an attack on freedom of expression in social networks.
Long-term homex
In addition to paying long-term debts without affecting short-term debt, the Homex housing developer is placing on the market Bursatile Certificates for 500 million weights.
The issue is the first of four identicals that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Nace Competival
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet companies, information technology leaders, have just been born a consortium with competitive social reasons, whose goal will be the market of services for software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos of the basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years attached to the board sport and, thanks to him, he traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was involved in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a player of minor categories, a player of the National Top Balloon, captured and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Vacareros or president of the Balonnesto Federation.
"I put a lot of hats in my life through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit from First Hour to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when making such a statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and monuments that mark his wide journey, thus testify to it.
Bayamón in the Heart
Of all, the most emotional gamblers are the ones who commemorate their passage through the Vacuums from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old acting as co-powered or mastered of the franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros champions since 1967, I had already been as an heir, co-authorate or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five races raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I fired with one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut in the BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had headed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong player, of 6"7" height.
Do you want it?"
And that was Mincy's principle, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vacuum champion with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, as for 1988 it was already a federal manamas.
For that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and Mincy's on the National Team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time during the 1989 Preolimpic period in Mexico.
Then came the World in 1990, where we got to fourth place and must have been bronze not to be for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
This 1990 World Group is the best National Team you've ever seen?
It's among the best, just like the one that won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Panamericans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave it to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to what we won the bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had "Toñito" Colon and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Qujote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90th due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Preolimpic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitner in replacement of the players suspended by the Lai del Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the prognostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculín did.
And that doesn't count on the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best borician leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I like Leo Arill's work very much.
What do you think your greatest achievement in the federation?
It was part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their area and only face teams from other islands of the island in national playoffs.
Even now, children travel and play too little.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for directors, table officers and referees.
That's what I'm happy about.
What are you doing now?
What I do is listen to music, watch videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, which has always been with me.
Kills the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, was world-famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnates a man of business without scrupulous, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, was dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family communiqué provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear home town of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the century, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her advertiser, Jeffrey Lane.
I was happy to meet everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I'll surprise him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the maximum," Gray said in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and was transplanted.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he finds an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and leads her to live with him in his home.
He was also a protagonist of two comedians who had little time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included papers well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the enchantingly disgusting J.R. that led Hagman to his maximum star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectation about a full episode of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
It also helped to give the series a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter of November 1980, an average of 41 million TVers tuned it to "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment program in history, after the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was J.R.'s cousin, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with a hooker unless she was outside the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corruption with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s stone," Hagman said in 1988.
You should say, "Here's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal you've lost.
Principal Victory, a co-protagonist of the original series, recalled Friday to Hagman as someone "great, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have the luck of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in process, the chain reported.
There was no statement by Warner or TNT about how the Hagman series will handle the loss.
Oriento de Fort Worth, Texas, was a son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who stared classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he married lawyer Ben Hagman in 1931.
He was lucky at the New York theaters in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he titled his "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought it would hurt someone or affect them in any way," said the Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the frightened patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I gather with them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer something of comfort, as "they don't fear, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but it'll be okay."
He was also an activist against smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistable angel: The end of the "large return account" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have been attached as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea of what was expected of him in the next couple of months: the Hurricane Sandy, a tax precipice that some have called "deudarmagedon" and an increasing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theologians of the end of time believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days old and counting, this has been a really good period.
And they remember it's bad for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vucker is teaching the course "Medios, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could blow up a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compared with real life examples.
"I have tried to inform the students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vucker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restal and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have made teams to give a course, titled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to give the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restal said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students any option but to work "until the same night that the world is supposed to end," said Restal.
The courses were quite popular.
"He sat down in two hours," said Restal about his high average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, of people who were wondering if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic, secular, or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or of the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class I could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a last-year student in Temple, aged 21 and West Chester.
Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restal.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by preaching the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"On the other hand, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, implying an exception to a superior authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restal pointed out that over the years many days of the final trial have been spoken of, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately on the next date" or to philosophy that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period of which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they were thinking about going to parties "of the end of the world."
"Maybe I call some friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
