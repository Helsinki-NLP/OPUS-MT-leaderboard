Members of the Wells Assembly do not want to “come to the maps”
Some members of the National Assembly are reluctant to accept an MWP abbreviation (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of the Wales Parliament).
The problematic solution is to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament in Wales.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about the possible jokes of this abbreviation.
One of the Laborists, expressing the opinion of his party, expressed concern that the new abbreviation was “towp and Pwp”.
For our readers, it's not from Wales: on the Wally Twp it means "tub", and pwp is "cake".
According to a member of the Assembly of the Wells Party, his organization had generally “remained inadequate” and offered other options.
The representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to the Muppet text (mappet).
In this context, a letter w in the Welsh language is spoken approximately as a letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently developing a draft law on the replacement of names, made the following statement: “The final decision on what members of the assembly will be called will of course remain.”
The Wales National Assembly of 2017 has been authorized to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion survey on the proposed options, according to which the Parliament of Wales option instead of the Assembly found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Members of Parliament of Wales” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while MWP had received the highest public support.
All in all, members of the Assembly propose other options, but the chairing member, Elina Jones, will find it difficult to find a solid solution to all decisions. Let me recall that the draft law on change should be submitted within a few weeks.
Reform laws will also include other modifications to the working process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the system of the Committee.
Members of the Assembly voted in favour of the final version of their appointment during the legislative debate.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted to rename the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The national vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name of the Republic of Macedonia implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly opposed the entry of its northern neighbours into the Euro Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, the opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he was not going to recognize the results.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that the change in the name of the country is the total price of entry into the EU and NATO.
Crisis in Garlem's revenue: Always silenced St. Martin's circle
“The elderly people in the area I was talking to said that before each corner was at the bar and at the church,” says Adams.
“And now there is nothing else.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood as follows:
“The communication format has changed.”
“Bar stopped being a kind of guest of the whole area where they came regularly.”
But with regard to the churches, it is concerned that the funds received from the sale of assets will not be long enough, as their leaders may have hoped. "They will be left with nothing sooner or later."
At the place of the church, he added, a multi-dwelling house would appear whose tenants would hardly support those who remained in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams says. “And this will be the day when such churches are finally closed, because new neighbors will never become their own.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Garlem became a black territory: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church 10 years later.
The first belonging to the Methodist Church left income in the 30th century.
Their building was redeemed by a black income in the neighborhood.
When St. Martin's church went into the hands of a black community, she was led by John Howard Johnson, who organized a shop boycott on 125th Street, the main trade artery of Harlem, where they refused to work or to be promoted in the service of the blacks.
In 1939, as a result of the fire, the building suffered considerable damage, and in the restoration work, the father Johnson was ordered to install a carilon.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who changed him into the head of St. Martin’s church, proudly called the carilon “cools for the poor”.
But the expert who tried the carilon in July called it "cultural heritage" and "unique historical instrument".
An expert at the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was St. Martin's carilon that was the first in the world to be the instrument of his kind played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago he was invited to play the largest carilon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merrieuezer, St. Martin's church has not yet been replaced.
In the last few months around St. Martin’s church, there has been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Church.
The meeting was held, the governing body of income, which included the light leaders, in July, expressed concern that the parish “trys to transfer the value of work” to the assembly was held, although the latter were not involved in the selection of architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some belongings expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of eparchy.
In California, the shark was injured by a 13-year-old lobbard.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old shark was attacked and injured in California.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near the Bikon Beach beach in Ensinitas.
As Chad Hammel reported in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego) on Saturday morning, he broke up with his friends and heard a boy cry for help about half an hour ago, while they and their friends rushed on the boat to the attack site and pulled the teenager out of the water.
According to Hammela, he first decided that the boy was very happy with the Lobster’s play, but quickly “he realized that he was shouting, ‘ They tasted me!
They have tempted me!"
After swimming to the well, Hammel noticed that “he had completely torn the skin around the key”.
“I called out to get everyone out of the water, “Here is the shark,” says Hammel.
The boy was delivered by helicopter to the Radi Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The kind of shark that's been hit by a teenager is unknown.
Captain Larry Gilz, during the press briefing, reported that a few weeks ago, a shark was spotted in this place, but it was not taken to dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack had been injured in the upper floor area.
The representatives of the authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to subjugate the British perfume and cosmetic market
Seinsbury is going to establish cosmetic and perfume divisions in shops of Buts, Superdrag and Debenhams with cosmetologists, on models of luxury universities.
The British perfume and cosmetic market is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings and continues to expand, while fashion and household goods fall, and a significant proportion of this desired market as an experiment in 11 country-wide shops will be presented to space offices for cosmetics and perfumery, and should be expected to be in many other shops in the coming year.
Supermarket owners are looking for more than filling up the former TV bands, microwave ovens, household goods, and investment in the perfume-cosmetic market is a good solution.
According to Seinsbury, the dual range of cosmetic products is expected to increase to 3,000 names, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will be presented to a larger extent, in special locations, according to the type of organization of the goods in the Butts shops.
In addition, the shop-cosmetics product line will be reorganized with the switch to the vegane products in order to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two Seinsbury shops will be presented by the perfumery manufacturer Fragrance Shop: the first of them has already been opened in Croatia in southern London last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet commerce and the trend to buy a small amount of products every day in small beds near home have led to the need for supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Cup, President Seinsbury, says that the tickets are gradually turned into universities, and the network of its supermarkets is fighting for buyers in the competitive fight against cheap shops, such as Aldi and Lidle, offering more services and non-food.
Hundreds of Seinsbury supermarkets are located in Argos, and some of them now can be found at Habitats since the network acquired two brands two years ago, and this has led to the increase in sales of food and supplies from these acquisitions.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to give a new life to their cosmetics and pharmacies have not been successful.
A joint venture between Seinsbury and Buts was organized in the early 2000s, but there were still disagreements among the participants on the income section of the sales of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
A new strategy was developed after the sale of the pharmaceutical business of Seinsbury (a total of 281 shops) by Selesio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury products to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Seinsbury, says: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our customers.
We have also invited special trained consultants, who will always be prepared to assist the Council.
Our brand range for any taste, pleasant design and comfortable location of the shops will attract many visitors in the search for cosmetics and perfumery. This will be a brand new concept of shopping."
Peter Jones responded to Holly Willowby's 11 million sterlings deal.
The star of the 'Logo Dragon' show, Peter Jones, "disgraced" by a TV show by Holly Willowby from a 11 million sterlings deal she was planning to conclude with Peter's Leifsteel brand, but instead she preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willowby has no time for their joint brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
This couple's business was compared to the Goop actresses of Guineat Peltrow.
The 37-year-old Etim morning programme announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willowby's decision to leave their profitable lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV led to Peter Jones's anger, the star of the Dragon League.
According to our sources, Jones was “disgraced” when a TV fan during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after concluding new contracts it would not have enough time for their common brand of household clothes and accessories True.
Their brand was compared to that of the actress Guinette Peltrow by Goop, and it was expected that her sales would double the Willowby status, estimated at 11 million pounds.
The 37-year-old leader announced his departure from Instagram, and Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his wills.
According to one source, “Truly’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
This was a long-term investment that would ensure that she had no care for the next few decades.
Its decision has led to the level of all parties to the transaction.
All were shocked by what happened on Tuesday, as the week before the start of the brand was considered.
In Marlow's headquarters, the entire warehouse was filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the care of the leading “Etum morning”, one of Britain’s most popular stars, can be a company in millions of pounds of sterlings due to significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothing, and the potential delay in starting the line.
It is also about breaking up old friendships.
The three fostering sons of Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for 10 years.
Willowby created a True brand together with Tara Kapp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples are often on vacation together, and Jones also has 40 per cent of the shares of Dan Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will become M&S Ambassador and replace Anthony McParterlin as the lead ITV “I’m Famous”.
A source from the nearby Jons district said yesterday evening: "We cannot comment on his business."
Complex negotiations, “and then we loved each other”
He was ashamed of the criticism that the media would be subjected to because of the “invalid president” comment and the positive assessment of North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Tramp said, reflecting the voice of the leading news.
"No, I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim Chen Ein was interested in the re-meeting, after Trump called them the first summit held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have come to an end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, a high-level North Korean diplomat, Li Jon Ho, made a statement to the world leaders at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is still awaiting “responsive” from the United States after the original CDR disarmament measures.
Instead, the U.S., a diplomat noted, continued to use sanctions as a pressure leak.
During the meeting of its supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
He said, “The North Korean case is a remarkable one.”
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
And now we have a good relationship."
According to Trampa, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen Yin bore fruit: missile tests were put to an end, hostages were released and US soldiers who remained in the territory of the PRC also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Chen Yin, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
"The President's favorite is so simple, but instead of 10 thousand people on the street that falls into this completely killed hall, there would be only 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
Guns and earthquakes in Indonesia: recorded catastrophes, hundreds of victims
On the first day of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs said that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboka population had been left to cover their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to announce a national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that international support was not needed, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
The Children's Savings organization is preparing a team to go to Pala, but we do not yet know if the foreign group will be able to work on the spot.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Disaster Management, the leadership of Indonesia conducted an assessment of the situation in Pala to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
In view of the continuing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country has continued to be horrendous in the face of natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceha, they can rarely be found on other coastlines.
Despite warning of the threat of tsunamis, there was no siren in Palau to warn the population, which probably led to so many victims.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously sheltered in Lomboca to help victims of earthquakes, is sent to Pala, but the road to a new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joco Vidodo has strengthened Indonesia's wet infrastructure as the main point of his election campaign and has spent countless resources to improve roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joco, a new-term candidate for the following year, was in trouble with financing.
The President also criticised the increase in interfaith enmity between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands of blood was shed as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other suicides.
Video: Liverpool game Daniel Starridge compares a match against Chelsea naked in the far upper corner of the gate
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from the 89th minute defeat of the Premier League against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stemford Bridge.
Starridge received a passport from Gerdana Shakiri about 27 metres from Chelsea gate when his team lost account 1-0.
He moved to the left and broke into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and felt in the far top of the net.
Golkiper Kep Arissabalag leaned in the direction of the ball, but it was already late.
In an interview with the LiverpoolFC.com Starridge website, he said: “The whole thing was to get in this position and get a ball, such as Shak, always playing the maximum attack, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible.”
“I saw that Kante was being sent to me, caught the ball, and, in a short time, knocked on the door.”
As a result of the first half of the match, Chelsea's team said 1-0, the goal for the 25th minute was to kill Belgian Eden Azar.
The central attacker, Chelsea, sent the passport back to Mateo Kovacic, and half of the camp broke into Liverpool.
In the middle of Kovacic played a single game.
He continued to pass the passport to the march of Azariah, who went to the gate.
Assar attacked Alison Baker's door with a left-wing strike and struck the remote corner of the network.
Liverpool will meet with the Naples team at the team stage of the League of Champions. Match will take place at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3:00.
Chelsea plays with the Video Club at the UEFA Eurolycs match, which will take place on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of victims of earthquakes and the following tsunamis in Indonesia reached 832, reported by the National Management of Natural Disasters on Sunday morning.
The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused tsunamis of up to six meters high, reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Office during the press conference.
The city of Palu, with its population of more than 380 thousand people, was struck by the ruins of broken houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of being injured by a woman
A woman's body was discovered this morning in the city of Birkenhed County of Mercisside, and a murder investigation is under way.
The body of 44-year-old women with knee wounds was found at 7:55 in the Grayson Mouse complex on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was suspected of being arrested in the murder.
The police will look for possible witnesses to murder among locals.
The Inspector of the O'Haygen Criminal Police says: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I am sure that I am asking all those in the John Street area in Birkenhede who could observe or hear anything suspicious about contacting us.
I am also addressing everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who could have sealed something on the video recorder, and please contact us with any information that might help the investigation.”
The police officer confirmed that the victim was living in Birkenhede and her body was found on the territory of the complex.
Today, well - known victims have arrived at the event to ask their questions about where it was discovered this morning.
The investigation is being conducted, and the police are preparing to report on the tragedy of the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mouse has tried to go to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned of what happened, he lost his gift of speech.
The householders were told that they would not be able to stay at home for at least a few hours.
One of the police said to the householder that the entire territory was considered a crime scene.
One woman cried.
"A little terrible!" she said.
Two police buses arrived at the scene at 2 o'clock, and another one stayed outside the fenced area.
Several police officers were stationed inside the fence to watch the apartment complex.
All who have any information are requested to send a personal message to @MerPolCC on Twitter, to call 101 or to call Crimestoppers anonymously by phone 0800 555 111 (case 247 of 30 September).
Cromwell ' s memory before Parliament ' s building sparked a heated debate on the “rewriting of history”
Cromwell would be worthy of compensation for the barbaric destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts of England by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crik's proposal “a summary” and “a rewriting attempt”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate on the record of historical monuments, the issue of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace is inevitable.
In addition, there is no relation to the economic movement during English civil wars.
It is likely that Oliver Cromwell suffers from the sins of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived centuries ago.
The magnificent statue of the authorship of Sir William Hamo Tornikroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historic achievements of man, which many still consider to be worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith, he said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of expert debates.
But it can certainly be said that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century had affected our country ' s subsequent development, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as a Lord Protector are also highly valued and respected.”
Chinese farmer killed a pig-killer
In one of South-West China's markets, a farmer has become a victim of swine, local media reported.
The body of the victim (only his name is mentioned in the media, "Juan") with a broken artery, was found near the market floor in the province of Lupanishhu Province of South China, where Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pigeon is preparing to introduce pigs to the pig farm, 30 May 2005, district of Sinin Province of China.
Juan and his twin brother arrived from the neighboring province of Junan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, the twin brother discovered the lifeless body of Joanna, and the door was opened in the neighboring pighouse.
There was a huge drop of blood in the creek.
During the trial, it was found that the pig weighed 250 kg of the farmer's threat to death.
“My brother’s feet were hurt and burned,” said the newspaper Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the murdered.
The video from the surveillance camera showed that John came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The pig killer wasn't brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was isolated at a separate run at the time of the investigation in order to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuan family is reported to be negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the death of a farmer.
Cases of swine attacks on humans often occur.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., and seriously injured a man.
Ten years ago, a 300 - kilogram [300 kg] animal was lured by a waly Christian to the tractor and let go, only by fearing the woman who had grown up.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer in Oregon, U.S.A., was fed with his own pigs. As CBC News reported to a Canadian farmer, pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can act on their hidden aggression as a “down mechanism”.
“Pigs of games,
They are curious and curious, but they have no intention of harming you.
You should simply convey your animal's feelings of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa brings rivers to a significant part of the South-West United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing its power, moving across the colder water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring floods and floods to the territory of North Mexico and South-West United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. tomorrow in New York, the cyclone reached 1st category with wind speeds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of Punta-Euhenia (Mexico).
It is expected that on Sunday, Hurricane will move north.
At the same time, over the Pacific, a low-pressure zone will begin to be formed, which will move east to the western coast of the United States. As the country nears the coast of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity to the north of Mexico, to the south-west U.S. territory.
More than 25 cm of sediment is expected in Mexico on Monday.
In the coming days of the South West, strong rivers are expected under the influence of tropical humidity that is falling into the low pressure zone.
The sediments from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous floodwaters, contaminated streams, and possible wastes in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical humidity, the precipitation rate may reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In certain areas of the South-West United States, mainly in most of Arizona territory, up to 5-10 cm of sediment is expected.
The risk of sudden high-speed floods is not excluded due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains.
At the current risk of the tropical forest, walking in the desert is affected by serious consequences.
Lions can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause the winds to collapse and raise the clouds of dust.
The low - pressure zone on the coast of southern California will collapse.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of sediment, which can cause small dirty streams and create rocky surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall in the region since the beginning of the rainy season.
On Sunday evenings and mornings, tropical rains will occur in Arizona on Mondays and Mondays, which will spread to other territories until Mondays and Tuesdays.
On Tuesday, the river will pass through the four corners of the area and extend until the dinner of the Wednesday.
In October, the United States territory will experience severe temperature changes due to low air temperatures in the Arctic at sufficiently high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to severe temperatures in a small territory.
Such sudden changes in temperature will be particularly observed in the central United States on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City (Missuri State) and Omaha (Nebraska State), and between St. Louis and De-Moonz (Ayova State), there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
Most of the U.S. Central and Eastern Territories are expected to be hot weather in early October, and the temperature will reach 27 degrees south-east of the country.
In New York on Tuesday, air temperature may rise to 27 degrees, 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the eastern coast of the United States by mid-October.
The Senate hearings of Judge Bretta Cavano have seen more than 20 million spectators
The testimony of Bretta Cavano and Kristina Blja Ford, who accused Cavano of attempted rape in the 1980s, drew more than 20 million viewers from six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to the candidacy of Kawano had received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, the media had an urgent communication: Republican Jeff Flake had made it possible for the FBI to investigate the charges against the lawyer for one week.
As Ford stated in his hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she was convinced that Kawano had attacked her in a state of torment and tried to distribute her at a school party.
Cavano gave emotional testimony, stating that 100 per cent was convinced that it was not.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, more than 20.4 million viewers were present in Friday debates.
The Agency took into account average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, has not yet been available.
Moreover, Nielsen’s rating does not always take into account viewers who watch television at work.
For comparison: this is the middle audience following the American football match in the playoff or Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was in Fox News Channel, whose leaders were in a hot position to support the appointment of Kawano: Senate hearings, all day long, saw an average of 5.69 million spectators, reported by Nielsen.
Second, ABC is 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS audience consisted of 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC viewed 2.89 million spectators, while CNN had 2.52 million reviews, Nielsen reported.
After listening to the matter, do not be weak.
On Friday, the current drama was played with Jeff Flake.
After the Senator of Arizona, who is considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support the candidacy of Kawano, CNN and CBS, he was able to seal the camera on Friday morning on the way to the Legal Committee meeting with a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen him, with his eyes down, getting a blow from angry women in the direct air on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said one of them.
"Do you think he is telling the truth?"
"The strength behind you, while so many women are powerless," tried to explain their position.
Fleeck replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement, and he would comment on the subject at the Committee meeting. The elevator door was closed, hiding the senator from the sitting chambers.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was prepared to approve the candidacy of Kavano for a judge and to send her to the Senate for a general vote, all channels broadcast the meeting in direct air.
However, Fleke made one condition — to investigate the FBI's allegations against the candidate the following week, as the democratic minority did.
Fleeck claims to have changed his mind through the intervention of another Senator of the Democrats, Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision, speaking to Kunsa and several other senators.
The Fleic decision had had an effect, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve the Cavano without an investigation.
By order of President Trampa F.B.R., an investigation of allegations was opened to Kawano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames her critics for the "political games" situation with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians who criticised her plan to leave the EU, that they were putting extra-party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain attends a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published on one panel with May, the former head of MID Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Shaski Plan in Brexit, stating that the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU is “absolutely impenetrable”.
Death of Wade Sims in shooting: Police arrested Daiton Simpson for suspected murder of Forvar University of Louisiana State
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
As Baton-Ruzh police reported, 20-year-old Daiton Simpson was arrested and detained for murder.
The police posted a video of the dragon with Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his eyes.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, the police found Simpson DNA at the scene of the crime.
During the investigation, Simpson admitted that Wade was fatally injured.
According to Advocate, a deposit of $350 thousand was set for Simpson.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton-Russia published a preliminary conclusion on Friday: death was caused by a cross-cutting gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division thanks the Division for the criminal investigation of the state police of Louisiana, the State Police Laboratories, the South University Police and local residents who have assisted in the conduct of the operational and risk activities that have led to detention.
Jo Aleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good-faith work on the reputation of a criminal”.
Simsus was only 20 years old.
The two-foot foreward was the native of Baton-Russia, and his father, Wayne, also played at the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, Sims picked 5.6 points and made 2.6 choices on average for the match.
Will Wade's team coach made a statement on Friday morning, saying that Wade Sims' tragic death caused “shock” and “current woe” to all players.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," added the coach.
The volcano covered the ashes of Mexico.
The Volcano Popokatepetl has sunk the ashes of the southern sections of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the Mexico National Centre for Disaster Prevention recommended that the population not get close to the volcano: its crater had registered activity and 183 passenger emissions were produced during the day.
According to the Centre, there was often a drop of dust in the area near the volcano, and there was a fluctuation.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, social media users published photographs of lobe glass cars covered with thin layers of ashes.
Following the earthquake of 7.1 MW, which shook the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded the volcanic activity in 72 km south-east of the capital.
Volcano Popokatepetl (or, for its part, Don Goyo) has been a active volcano since 1994.
Meetings of the Catalan separatists before the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona, a thousands of meetings were held on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which broke down the country into two camps.
Police officers pushed out protestors of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, were being held captive by eggs and dusty cows, raising the cloud of dark dust in the center of Barcelona.
After the police left the hole to stop the crowd, the riots resumed with a new force.
For a number of hours, the people of independence shouted, “Let us not forget, nor forgive.” And their opponents answered, “Peace be upon Spain.”
According to the local press, fourteen shareholders of the shares went to the hospital with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the departure of Catalonia from Spain, which was recognized by the illegal Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for separatists.
Catalonia with a huge surplus voted for an exit from Spain, but the appearance was low because the opponents of the exit had predominantly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured during last year ' s attempts by the police to block the referendum at the country ' s polling stations.
On Friday, separatists sat on the claimed track of the demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it from being conducted.
The demonstration took place anyway, but it went the other way.
A 68-year-old electrician named Narsis Termes, who visited a separatist meeting in his wife's company, notes that the hope of obtaining Catalonia's sovereignty is becoming more and more fragile.
“Last year, one of the most important events in our lives has happened.
My parents cried fortunately, having been given the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in suspense," he said.
In the recent December elections in the local authorities, the Catalan parties, representing the Spanish office, have won an important victory, even with a slight break, but this year their movement loses its supporters, as many of the well-known movement leaders are either in the run-up or in custody, awaiting the court for their role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old telephone recorder in support of the police, said that the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is growing,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, announced his intention to be in the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in ordinary elections in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he said.

"Livingston" victory over "Randers" thanks to the target goal of Mengy
First goal Dolly Mengy won a guaranteed victory by the Livingstone team
Thanks to the killing of the Livingstone ball, he won an unexpected victory over Rangers. For the main coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerard, this is only a second defeat for 18 games.
The Dolly Mangy hit leveled Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian club in the opening table, where they share second place.
The Gerard Club was left without a victory in the Premier League season. On Sunday, they will meet with the group leaders, Harts, from which Rangers will be left at eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will take place on their field of battle of the League of Europe with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
The Livingstone Club continues its playable series in the division, has already won six matches and has not received any defeat since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the lead coach of the team.
Lost moments for Livingstone in the grip of intense guests
Holt's undergraduate coaches had to account from the very beginning — “renderers” obviously did not cope with their efforts.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the line of protection, but the naked man did not get out of his weak attempt, and then the defense guard Alan Litgou, turning too wide, was unable to prevent the King Halket's ball from getting on the net.
The receiving party allowed Rangers to play in front of their line of protection, counting on dangerous moments when the game was resumed.
That's how they missed this important goal.
Rangers gave up a free strike, and Livingstone took advantage of the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer to Menge, who was killed from the central state.
By then, Rangers had been superior to the ball, but the protection of the host team was unheard of, so Liam Kelly's doorkeeper was not worried.
The second team continued on the same schedule, although Kelly had to undo the blow from Alfredo Morelos.
The Rangers doorman Allan McGregor turned down the sword from Scott Pittman, and Litgou made a broad submission from the standard.
The ballers have been constantly hit by the Livingstone penalty, but all the attacks have been reflected, and two penalty demands — one for the promulgate of Glenn Midlton Halkett and the other for the game by hand — have not been met.
“Penomenal” game “Livingston” — analysis
By BBC Scotland — Alaster Lamont, a report by Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and excellent result for the Livingstone team.
Absolutely all the games were magnificent, and on a regular basis all expectations were surpassed, continuing to rise to the football Olympics.
Their style of games and composition has not changed since they were brought back to top ratings, and the great merit of Coach Holt was that he had mobilized this team from the beginning.
His team had a number of current heroes.
Captain Halkett led a wonderfully organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Urall relax.
But Rangers couldn't get in the rhythm.
Although they had good playtimes with Coach Gerard, this time they didn't justify our expectations.
In the last few minutes, the player did not take possession of the ball, but only one day they were able to protect the host team. Rangers, who had dropped to the middle of the table, had something to think about.
Cold reception of Erdogogan during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the morning, there was a wonderful weather, and both of them were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO parties, a visit, and without any conflict.
The heads of countries were unable to understand issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
After Erdogan was sent to Cologne to participate in the ceremony of opening a huge new mosque.
In Cologne, Turkey's largest diaspora is located outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-thousand crowd to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogogan's supporters were nearby to see their president.
At the same place, opponents of the Erdogogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn both the policy of Erdogogan and the decision of the German Government to invite him with a visit to Germany.
The presence of radically conflicting views at the meeting reflects the inconsistencies of this figure: many Turkish-based Germans carry Erdogogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Accident on the roads of Deptford: Car collision led to the death of a biker
In London, the car was hit by a bicycle driver who ended up at the scene.
Avariya happened close to Besud Street and Evelyn Street, a revitalized crossroads in the south-eastern part of the city of Depfort, about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver and the ambulance were trying to help the bicycle driver, but the man did not realize it.
This is not the only accident with a fatal outcome in the area: only half a mile from the scene, on the Childers Street street, another biker was hit by a car whose driver had been hiding.
The London police report that work is currently being done to identify the person of the deceased and to notify his closest relatives.
As long as the road is closed and the bus route is changed, drivers are asked not to go to the area.
Long-Lartin prison disorder: injured six police officers
Six police officers were reported to have been injured during the riots in the men ' s prison.
The men's prison of Long Lartin (Wustershir) has continued to be indiscriminate since Sunday, binding about 9:30 a.m. on local time.
To suppress the disorder in which eight prisoners from one wing were involved, the Tornado Opera Group was called.
The police had suffered minor damage to the soft tissue of their faces, and medical attention was provided on the ground.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff were recruited to permit the incident in the Long-Lartin correctional facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their degree of repression may be altered for a longer time.”
Long Lartin currently has over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had fallen into a hospital under attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, the prison management was forced to attract special-purpose units to calm the busted prisoners who had thrown billiards into the guards.
Hurricane Rosa can flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the dry territories)
Arizona rarely falls into the area of intensive tropical cyclone, but this time it was “carried”: at the beginning of the next week, when Hurricane Rosa made her last trip, she had to cross the desert part of South-West and bring the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and the southern and eastern part of the state of Nevada, in southern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Hurricane Rosa will cross the line over Phoenix on Tuesday and pass through the river on Monday evening.
The Office of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “all ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) walked 65 km from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, it will range from 5 to 10 cm of sediments reaching 15 cm in the Arison Plato Mogolon-Rim.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible to land up to 2.5 to 5 cm of sediments and landfills can reach 10 cm.
For areas with river currents going to the side, the rain caused by Hurricane Rose can be a blessing, because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although the floodwaters may pose a danger, abundant rains can facilitate the dry season that is not in the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona's territory is affected by severe drought (second category severity),” reports the weather.com website.
At first, Hurricane Rosa is headed for the Mexican state of Lower California.
As early as the day of the resurrection, hurricane, the maximum speed of which is 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta-Euhenia (Mexico) and is heading north at 19 km/h.
Hurricane has been found in a colder area on the Pacific coast and thus loses its power.
On the second half of the day, Hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
Abundant rivers are expected to pass through certain areas of Mexico with the threat of flooding.
“In the territory of the Lower California to the north-west of Sonora, up to 7-10 cm of sediments, up to 25 cm of land”, reports the weather.com website.
Furthermore, Hurricane Rosa will head north through the territory of Mexico, and early in the morning on Tuesday he will arrive at the border with Arizona in a tropical cyclone category. From Arizona he will come to the south of Utah to the evening of Tuesday.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its residues is the strong floods in Lower California, the north-west of Sonora and the desert areas of the South-West United States,” the National Meteorological Service reports.
It is expected that the sediments will cause dangerous floodwaters, polluted desert streams and possible mining in the mountain areas.
The attack in Midsomer Norton: four suspects were detained in an attempted murder.
In Somerset, 16-year-olds have had severe knife injuries, and three teenagers and 20-year-olds are suspected of attempted murder.
The victim of severe injuries was found in the area of Excelsior Terras in Midsomer Norton about 4 hours a day on Saturday.
After hospitalization, it is considered to be “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstok area, reports the Avon and Sommerset District Police.
The police will look for possible witnesses of a crime with any video on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "In Kavano all hatred has been broken, all the evil of the Democrats"
“The voice behind Judge Kawano is a voice against the ruthless and disturbing tactics of democracy,” Tramp said at a meeting of his comrades in Willinga, West Virginia.
According to Trampa, in the process of approving the nomination of Kavano to the candidate, “all hatred, all anger” of the Democratic Party has been interrupted.
On Thursday, Cavano gave testimony at the U.S. Congress, in his emotional treatment he categorically rejected the charge of Kristina Blizza Ford that he had sexualized her more than 30 years ago when she was both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also gave testimony during the hearing on her indictment.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day, “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage”.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Kawano is the vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unencumbered public service list,” said the president of the group of his fellows in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the President raised the question of the nomination of Kawano, which dealt with the importance of the appearance of Republicans in the Congress and the House of Representatives.
“For the most important elections in our life, only five weeks remain.
I don't participate in them, but that's why I participate in the race in a different way," he said.
“I carry on as a fuel and fight for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the democracies have tasked themselves “with all the strength to resist us”.
Under the regulation, the first key vote in the Senate for the approval of the candidacy of Kawano should take place no later than Friday, the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has taken hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, many had been killed by giant waves that had seized the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, which had been hit by the incredible force of tsunamis and earthquakes.
The first victims were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in the city of Palo. On Friday they reached the shoreline of nearly six meters high, and they were braved all on their way and led to the instant death of many of those present.
Cunami followed the earthquake of 7.5 on Richter's scale.
“When a storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach rest rather than to escape immediately in hiding and therefore lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Office of Natural Disaster Management at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis didn’t come, there were machines, wells, houses, nature destroyed everything in its path,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunamis crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h, and with all the force on the coast.
Some of those present were taken to the trees to save their lives.
About 16,700 locals were evacuated to 24 shelters in Pala.
The management summary of the disaster relief management shows destroyed homes, shops, broken bridges and heated walls.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still smashed by underground debris.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The statement by the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake caused by energy emissions was approximately 200 times more than when the nuclear bomb destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunamis may have been stronger than expected by the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow Gulf.
Negroho called the damage “massile”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the broken buildings; all the injuries were 540 people, and another 29 were found missing.
Nugroho added that the victims and destructions could be even more significant along the coast 300 km from Pala, in Dungala, which was close to the quake.
Communication with Dungala was “completely destroyed and no information was received”.
“There are more than 300 thousand people living in the area of Dungala,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already moved to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not yet a border”, says the Communication.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it had not reported the arrival of the tsunamis in Pala, but the authorities believed that the waves had reached the coast at the time the initial warning was still in force.
There was a loving video on social media, in which a man on the top floor of the building shouted about the rising tsunamis, desperate to attract people's attention on the street.
After a few minutes on the beach, the water wall is demolished, entire homes and cars are removed.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authority of this role.
Earthquake and tsunamis have led to a major increase in power lines, resulting in a lack of communication in Pala, which has made rescue operations very difficult.
Military transport aircraft were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and items of the first need, government sources reported.
The city ' s airport was opened only to receive humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centres in Pala will visit President Joco Vidodo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity came from Dungala to Pala, where the staff found shelter in the dining rooms that were broken down in their office building. According to Doseb Sinai, their eyes saw a terrible picture of complete destruction.
“They saw a great multitude of ruined houses, ” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Beneficiary organizations have begun to implement humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that international NGOs have failed to enter Pala.
Indonesian legislation allows for funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign organizations only after the announcement of a natural disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is considered to be a local disaster,” says Aulia Ariana, the press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government announces a national natural disaster, we will be able to receive foreign assistance, but as long as the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Paul, friends and relatives of the people who had fallen, they still look forward to their wonderful salvation, which will bring the people back to their faith in the best.
A little boy who fell into a sewer hole was saved on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers pulled out of the building a woman who had spent two days there with her mother's lifeless body.
Hendon Subandono, a coach of the National Assembly of Indonesia on Paraplaneticism, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among other people trapped in Roa Roa's hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s difficult to experience emotionally,” he said.
Hendon recalls, as I learned about the breakdown of Roa Roa from other paraplaneists, over the next hours he was desperate to contact whatsApp with his colleagues from Pala who were resting at the beach festival.
However, his messages were represented by a series of branches, not two pigeons.
“This means that the communications were not delivered,” he said.
Hard drive $26,750 during the service of the ATM in Newport-on-Levia
Incassador Brink's, one of the banknotes in Newport-on-Levia, was arrested by the criminals on Friday morning, as reported in the news release of the Newport police.
As researcher Dennis McCarty said, the driver of the armored microbus took the cash from the ATM in the fun complex and was about to hire him with new notes.
At that time, "Brink's officer escaped from his back" and stole a banknote bag.
Several suspects were reported to have escaped from the scene of the crime, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information on these persons are requested to contact the Newport Police Office, number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed its name
Rapper Cany West thought of himself as a new name: Yes.
He announced this on Saturday in Twitter: “The identity previously known as the Canine West”.
The 41-year-old West has long carried this pseudonym and even put it in the name of its eighth album that came in June.
The news of this appeared in the introduction of Cana to Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Cany West will be a leader instead of an Ariana singer, who has cancelled her participation due to “emotional experiences”, the transmission author reported.
West has previously stated that pseudonym is not only a reduced option but also a religious sense.
"Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means "we", "we"," so West explained the name of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
"That's me, that's you, that's us.
At first it was Kanje, which means "one", and now I am only She, that is, the reflection of all good, bad, unattainable in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
Cany's not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Daddy, Pi Diddy or simply Diddy, asked to call himself Love (“love”) or Braza Love (“Brat Love” or“Brat Love”) this year.
The West rapper J-Zi has also changed his name several times: with a definition and without, with a letter or a string.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
Mexico President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador swore never to resort to military force against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration ending with a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolko Square, President Lopes Obrador promised “never to resort to the help of the army to oppress the Mexican people”.
At this location, on October 2, 1968, the students received their first round of fires at a crowd, and a 300-year-old was shot in the background of the strengthening of the left-wing student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also promised support to a Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of prospects for learning are leading young people into a criminal world.
The need to double funding for the development of JI
China should not be underestimated and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (CI) - the United States should double investment in its scientific development, as Li Caiaphas, an investor and an enterprise in the field of II development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
A number of US ministries have made earlier declarations on II work, although the United States as a whole does not have a clear II development strategy.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first in innovation by 2030.
“Increaseing the IE research budget twice would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we expect the next II breakthrough,” Li says.
The increase in funding could double the chance that the next major achievement of II would be achieved in the United States, Li CNBC said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Kremney Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director General of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, Face +.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie-Mellon on an artificial intelligence system that was the highest player in the U.S. Hotel and then the leader of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency Defence Advanced Research Projects, and wondered when the next competition would take place to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“Not China embraces academic leaders, but corporations,” said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
It is convinced that immigration policy changes can also help the United States to develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that green cards should be automatically offered to applicants in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences provides scientific funding similar to that of the National Research Fund and other government organizations providing money to American researchers, but the quality of the scientific work in China is confirmed by Lee below.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence for Industrial and Scientific Partners, and the White House announced the establishment of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a programme called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in the II study.
In the meantime, US legislation, which sought to establish the National Intelligence Security Commission, has not taken any action in this regard for several months.
Macedonians vote on the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in favour of a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, consisting of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim in its territory and has put a veto on its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on a new name, but opponents-nationalists claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President Georgie Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voters would meet the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”.
Participants exchange names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for entry into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future country, for the young of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” explains 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski, the resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that they would respect the results of the vote to make it decisive, although it did not have the legal force to do so.
A change in the title would require a two-thirds majority of Members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no reports of violations had been made by 13:00.
However, the appearance was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, an elector from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country, which will pave the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Prior to the building of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage, setting up a chair for those citizens who are going to boycott a referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU membership, but we want to join with a high-level head, not in violation of the thresholds of official offices," Kawadarkov says.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can appeal to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would make investments in Macedonia, which was so necessary in the country where the unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be fine, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that the positive response will be “a source of our good future”.
The survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, but this was the required phenomenon below.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom TV channel revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of these figures claim to be positive.
In order for the referendum to take place, the appearance should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious impact on the policy of the Western Government since it came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguaro from Manchester City is protecting Briton to kill the goal
Sergio Aguaro and Rahim Sterling argued with the defense of Briton, bringing Manchester City to victory at 2:0 on Saturday at the Ethyhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguaro shot his target in 65 minutes, it seemed like it wasn't his job.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a passport at the center of the field.
He missed out among the three Bryton defenders before going out into open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four competitors in green football.
He went through one of the defendants and covered several more on the edge of the Briton's criminal zone.
He went on to deliver Sterling's ball to the left.
An English attacker, located in a criminal zone, brought back Aguaro's ball, which had knocked the Bryton door into the right corner of the door.
“Aguero has some leg problems,” said Manchester City’s coach, Pep Gardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he hit the target at that point."
But it was Sterling who gave the Blue Sky an initial advantage in fighting the League.
That goal was killed in 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguaro won the ball, being deep in the territory of Brayton
He gave a great cut on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sonne did a couple of things before he handed Sterling over to a remote cabin.
The attacker, the Blue Sky, shot the ball in the door just before he flew outside the field.
Manchester City was defeated by Hoffenheim in the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rein-Nekkar-Arene in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick the eyes at Colorado Rockiz.
After Washington Nationals got out of the game-off battle, there was no special reason to force events.
But the invincible Sherzer hopes to take up the fight against Colorado Rocky on Sunday, but only if Roxy, which runs into one Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division, will have problems in playoff.
By winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evening, Rociz has already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they are still hoping to secure a title in the first division.
“Although we play just that, but at least we can hold positions, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of viewers and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the winemaker on Sunday, but, according to the latest data, they are willing to expose Sherzer to this role.
Sherzer, going to play 34th, threw a ball on Thursday for the drinkers, and on Sunday, in his exit, he will be a drinker.
The Washington Pistachios statistics are 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump runs a pre-election race in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the presence of Republicans in the interim elections, the President specifically referred to the situation around Brett Kawano, the candidacy of the President of the Supreme Court.
“All we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks left before one of the most important elections in our life.
It's very, very important, I'm not running, although I'm really running, fighting everywhere for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to restore power, using whatever means are necessary, and we observe badness and wickedness.
They are the same as the ones they try, whom they must break to gain power and control, and that is what they want — power and control, but we are not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he claims, have set the goal of “resisting and hindering”.
“And you will see it in the last four days,” he said, calling the democracies “bad, false, lying, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate's Legal Committee, referring to Senator Diane Finnstein, which caused a loud voice from the hall.

Did you allow the contents of this document to run away?
Mmm... mm... what document?
No, no, the language of the body has given it away, and I have never seen the language of the body to be so disproved."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with different views.
It does not show tolerance to those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party offered a vote of disbelief to me, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who have not yet said that we are not welcomed by what we say.
A similar attitude to my colleague in the House, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, in the irony of fate, is the issue that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Notice of the Nottingham East Laborist Assembly on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the eight years of my stay as a local member of Parliament from the Laborist Party, the evening Friday meetings of the GC were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today's tone does not correspond to those many meetings, but the "more human and soft" policy promise has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that there are no differences in views in the Laborist party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the party ' s leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues, whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own, had come to expect that I would radically change my views and take the position that I would never agree with — whether national security or the single EU market.
Every time I make a public statement — and it is not important that I speak — the social media should be subjected to a series of insults that call for the abolition of elections condemning the policy of the centre or claiming that I should not be a member of the Laborist Party.
And that's not the only thing that happens to me.
Indeed, I know that I have been happier than some of my colleagues because comments in my address still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily attacks on sexual or racist soil, but never retreat.
It is most disappointing in this policy that such a number of insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Laborist party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a “wide church”, and with every voice of distrust or change in the rules of the party's choice.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling for me to sit quietly and to speak, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labourers 32 years ago, as a school student who was upset by the neglect of the Tatcher Government, because my school class had literally collapsed, I have tried to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who needed it most, whether it was the work of a local deputy or a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, I have not done so in the past elections.
No one in Notting East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say that our country is moving to Brexit, which is guaranteed to be an economic, industrial and state-run, and I do not understand the wish of some to spend their time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to appeal to is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters don't matter whether they're Labourers or not: I'm proud of what I'm doing to you, and I promise that there's no danger that the outcome of the elections or political will will will prevent me from acting as I think is necessary in your interests.
Chris Leslie, member of Parliament from Nottingham East
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible “Er” comes first
Two late attempts may have led to several final results, but “Er” certainly deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting game of the Tenenta League Prime Minister.
Now they're taking over the table, the only invincible team of tens.
Finally, all thanks to their superior protection, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to grieve,” said Peter Mercie.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth giving "Er," they've done their best."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Klimo led by Er, but the yellow card issued for the game "Voriors" by the Scottish player Rory Heuss allowed Melrose to proceed, and Jason Baggot caught up with an unrealized attempt.
Klimo increased Er's fracture from the criminal before, directly in the middle of the game, earned a score and then made a lonely attempt at the break, making an account 17-5 for Er.
But Melrose started the second half well, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, realized by Baggot, reduced the poison to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, which had been resolved, and after the re-existence, “Er” moved further thanks to the attempt by Stafford McDawel, implemented by Klimo.
The current captain, Er, Blair Mcferson, then received a yellow card, and once again Melrose, forced the rivals to pay a regular toy for an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the landlord returned, and when Stroan Hatchinson received a yellow card for the arrest of Klimo without a ball with a penalty line, Makferson made a tachdown behind the coming "Er".
Klimo realized the advantage without stopping almost from getting out again after Kyle Row had been hit by David Armstrong and sent the final attacker, Gregor Henry, to the fifth attempt by the field owners.
The Still Game star is going to start a new career in a restaurant business
The Still Game Ford Kiran star is about to start working in the hospitality industry: it was known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, a script he writes about, and is filmed with a former comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth show would be the last show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Creegang.
According to official information, he is Director Aeringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirnan is planning to participate in the "excellent restaurant business" in Glazgo.
“Our sea” means a land that has no exit to Bolivia, hoping that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the military headquarters in La Pase.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are described by the slogan: "Our sea is right.
It is our duty to bring it back."
All over Bolivia, the landlocked, still alive, is memory of the coast line lost to Chile as a result of the 19th-century bloodshed conflict because of resources; living and striving to swim back over the Pacific.
These hopes may have been the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting decisions by the International Court of Justice, which will take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and the balance of the soul and, of course, there is a positive result here,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kaldzilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision-making process at the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate for Bolivia ' s sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, charismatic president of the Bolivian indigenous peoples, who is taking an uneasy fight for re-election next year, is also looking forward to the decision that will be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court would hardly take a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, that would change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to rule the territory of Chile and has already stated that it will have no impact on the outcome of the negotiations.
The decision of the International Court of Justice only six months after the last arguments were heard said that the case was “not difficult”, says Pas Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, Bolivia has not been moving forward, and it has been delayed all the time.
“The current administration of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes”, Zarate said.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed Chile’s last goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
These two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court ' s decision was made too quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia “the unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit”, he argues.
Kalsidilla also disagrees that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the military-sea problem as a political co-sponsor.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to make sure once again that we have to move beyond our past.”
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not be possible until it can trust the United States
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Jon Ho claims that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it is able to trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri took part in a meeting of the UN Geneva Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the Singapore summit among the leaders of its countries.
His comments are made as US Secretary-General Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resumption of stupid nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Jin.
Ri argues: The dream that long sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put North on its knees is a utopia.
Washington is afraid to approve this declaration if the Pyrenees do not take significant steps to disarmament.
And Kim, and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want to hold the second summit.
But skepticism about the fact that the Pyrenees are serious about the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit the Pyrenees next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion shows demonstrate the latest line of massive major clothes that promise to appear in the media, and they will be brought directly to you.
If you want to add a trap to your collection or protect yourself completely from sunscreens, there is no need to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented the mass of unusual major clothes, which are part of their SS19 collection and the blind visitors of the Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely unpracticed traps won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and the designers decided to send their snowflakes to the podium.
The outstanding example of Valentino: the main running suit decorated with wide, periphery-like fields was adorned on the heads of the models.
Other massive accessories included decorated with precious stones of arbusia, witch hat and even pineapple, but all these main clothes are not meant to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also appeared in the world a collection of amazing masks, which had to become very early in Halloween.
Many of these stone masks were covered, and they remembered the portrait of Gannibal the reader more than the creation of the corner.
One of the specimens recalled the equipment for underwater swimming with a tube and protective eyes, and the other one was frozen.
If you're a high-modecrat, you're lucky.
Modern critics predict that these huge traps have every chance of going to mass sales — directly to you.
The large-scale traps follow the five La Bomba, a two-foot loose trap, all of which had already been put on, from Rianna to Emily Ratakovski.
The cult label that released this extremely unpracticed hat that won such a wide popularity in social networks, gave birth and sent another huge accessory to play on the floor — a solstice beach bag, almost as large as the same model in the bathroom wearing that bag.
The orange bag of a popular rafia with a white leather handle and a rafia scarf became a bright copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on the Fashion Week in Paris.
The Selebrite-Stylistic Luke Armitage tells us in F: “I think that large strips and beach bags will appear in the media next summer, and since the designer has produced such a furor with his productions, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which has been confirmed in 2018: the results of the exams have demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, and there are efforts to provide a higher level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and the status of the citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that modern languages remain a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak with a man of understanding, you will understand.
If you speak to him in his native tongue, you will turn to his heart."
This is a convincing evidence that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build and trust relations with nationals of other countries.
As a result of the recent examinations this year, we see that the languages are taking leading positions in the league tables and have the highest scores of exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the highest score of “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS students showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese language), while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that in Scotland's independent schools, foreign languages are undoubtedly of vital importance to children and young people in the future.
Language materials are now being used in the same way as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in education programmes of independent schools and other educational institutions.
The survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that there was a lack of language skills in 17 per cent of the reasons for the difficulties faced by employers in filling vacancies.
Thus, language skills are becoming a key to a successful future career for young people.
In view of the fact that more prospective jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of what profession a student will choose, if he learns the second language, he will gain a real advantage in the future by adopting another additional skill that will suit him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives competitive advantages to a person who knows several foreign languages.
According to a survey by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak well in a foreign language to support the conversation, while French was the only language with a double percentage, 15 per cent of respondents said.
That's why investing in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children more opportunities to find good work.
In schools in Scotland, there is enough language distribution to be taught — a set of languages in each school.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain in the light of future development of the country by 2020 — such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a choice in independent schools in several languages with a teaching composition, whose members are specialists in these languages.
Scotland ' s independent schools seek to create an environment of education that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what future awaits them.
At present, languages remain vital in the global business environment for the future development of the country, and should therefore be adequately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be viewed as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for Scotland's youth.
It needs to be done.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The ambitious expectation of fans to see Lebron James for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers was almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James was playing in a preseason resurrection match against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and fewer than four hundred eight,” Walton replied on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James was probably playing a limited time.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in Lakers.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare for the season,” says the player.
Trampa pre-election race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting to fan the election meeting tonight in Willinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump next week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidacy proposed by the Supreme Judge was postponed, Trump sought support in the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress if the vote took place in November.
How many evenings will the Trump meet in West Virginia, and how can we view it online?
A meeting with Trump in Willinga, West Virginia, will be held at 19:00 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump meeting with West Virginia voters online on direct broadcast on YouTube.
The Trump will probably take part in the hearings that will take place this week on the subject of the nomination of his candidate Bretta Cavano to the Supreme Judge. The proposal by Trump of that candidate has caused a lot of negative reactions, as Kavano has been accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed for a week until the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this action is to help the Republicans in the November elections to increase their pre-election rate.
Thus, President Tramp's campaign is aimed at helping these five meetings, which should be held next week, to “activize the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters writes.
“Congress control is so important for its agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, because we enter the tense pre-election season,” says the press secretary of the Trump pre-election campaign, who refused to be called Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Willinge can attract supporters from "Ogayo and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
A visit to the West Virginia Trump this Saturday is already the second visit of the state in the last month, because it was here that it benefited more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate in the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisi, who is lagging behind as a result of the interrogations.
“The fact that Morrisi has begun to challenge the contestants must come to the president, which is a bad sign for Morris,” says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (Quoted from Reuters).
Ryder 2018: United States Assembly demonstrates readiness to fight and hopes by sending Sunday to couples meetings
After three one-sided sessions, the two-by-two Saturday game may have been exactly what Kubok Ryder needed.
The transitional initiative is an extremely clever sport concept, but it is believed to be a game, and in such competitions it is particularly pronounced.
So who has the initiative?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it's a small initiative for us," Jordan Spit said as he left.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and another twelve on the horse.
The Americans feel the "wind in the parouses", and they have reason to keep the spirit up, not least because of the shape of Spita and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can be praised by three of the four.
The bed was steady from you to the branch, as a personal example was given.
The bells were getting louder as his round went on, the decisive ball was thrown into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas were two by two.
His strike, which won him the 15th hole, was met with a similar blow, one of those who speak of his faith as a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with all the forces and focus only on our games,” Spy commented.
That's all that's left of the game.
Go through 18 moons and become winners.
The only games that have earned more points in the last two days than Spy and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of Kubka Ryder.
A strange but charming couple from Europe killed four of them, and they don't seem to know the mistake.
Molivud was the only couple who had not made a god on Saturday, but they also avoided gods on Saturday morning, Friday and again on Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and non-existent patients strengthens the faith that they will not win, and when the sun is hidden behind the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous game that will strengthen Europe's potential victory than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be great if both were in different holes at the same time.
However, it is early on about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly quarreled with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of four matches when he was paired with Alex Norren.
The gods and the two double gods on the first nine holes took out the Spanish and the Swedes, from which they could not get out.
So no one will help you out of your pit on Sunday.
It is so interesting to watch the games in four balls and four players because of the interaction between the couples, the councils they exchange and who deliberately reduce, and how the strategy can change into a single moment.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far, and it has been going a lot forward in the last day, but this Thursday session has also shown that the United States has all the power to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day, Cuba Ryder Europe leads with account 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of Kubka Ryder after the end of the Saturday matches in four balls and Thursdays with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National account to four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return lost to Hazeltina two years ago, dominated the alleged error of the American team in the morning in four matches, winning with the account 3-1.
There were more resistance on Thursdays, two matches won, but they were unable to reduce the gap in the account.
Team Jim Farik needs eight points from the 12 resurrected match to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European novelty to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the call "Mollivud" after the sensational outputs, became only a second pair, who won four points in the first four matches in the history of Kubka Ryder.
With Woods and Patrick Reed in four matches, they were then beautifully united to win over the fallen spirit of Woods and American novel Breisson Decebmo with even more determined 5/4.
Woods, the last of the two Saturdays, showed periodic problems, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in four, and the fourth was seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who took a break before the morning game in four matches, returned to partner Henrik Stanson on Thursday, winning Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka with a 2/1 account of the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game has not become an easy and enjoyable walk to the south-west of Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas worked on Saturday became the focus of the Americans.
They won a decisive victory with 2/1 on Spanish John Ram and Ayan Polter in the game in four balls and returned later to win Polter and Rory Macylroy in 4/3 on Thursday, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubka Ryder, the team was driven from four corners, alone, given that the team of Ferika, as I own, had to be killed in order to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, on Sunday, the contract looks as if it were beyond their capabilities.
North Korea said that “categorically” would not be unilaterally disarmed without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were increasing mistrust towards the United States and that his country would not, under any circumstances, give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Jon Ho said to the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “essential measures of good will” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear site and the obligation not to increase nuclear weapons and the development of nuclear technologies.
“We don’t see a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be able to take the first action on disarmament unilaterally.”
While Rei reiterated the already-sounding North Korean complaints against Washington ' s “step-by” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded by step-by-step measures, his statement was important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phanyan did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen Yin and Donald Trump at the first in the history of the summit between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start the movement towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and Trump promised North Korea security assurance.
North Korea is seeking to formalize the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States states that the Pyrenees must first renounce their nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the call to weaken the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “denuclearization should first be done”, and increase the level of pressure through sanctions in order to enforce their goal and even oppose “an announcement of the end of the war”, says Rí.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the current problem is that the continued sanctions are increasing our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the United States leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jee In, which took place in the last five months, and added: “If the issue of denuclearization was South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been such a deadlock.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed sharply from last year when he told the United Nations Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missile to the U.S. mother was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim “a suicide missile”.
This year in UN Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remains to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not indicate any time-limits for the process: “Will it take two years, three years or five months? ”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage the Phanyan to take the steps taken.
However, US Secretary Mike Pompey said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of sanctions by the Security Council should continue actively and compulsorily until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unilaterally increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of overfunding the Phoenix nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN Genassembly summit and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyrenees again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July he left Phanyan, he said that progress had been made, but for several hours after that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandish demands”.
North Korea promised to disarm the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States, on its part, would take “appropriate measures”.
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he spoke about were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard learn to rest on special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all students to learn to sleep more and to fight the chauvinist culture of the continuous consumption of caffeine in order to cheer up “night of rest”.
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often had no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first in the United States.
After his opening, he had set up the idea of introducing such a course, with a preliminary report on the impact of a lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, the girl came to me and said, ‘I’m sorry that I’ve learned about this only now that I’m almost out of my training.’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — that I was surprised, ” he told The Telegraph.
The course, for the first time proposed to students this year, relates how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports success and how it improves the overall human self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry of the Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Health Service of the University, said that the university decided to introduce this course after it was found that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the week of school.
The job is one hour long, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
A section of the exercise offers a picture of a room in the living room, where students who insist on coffee cups, dishes, coaches and books receive information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which cause a lack of sleep — affects sports outcomes and how important it is to get sufficient sleep daily.
In the second section, participants will learn how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
An interactive campus map encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these exercises will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as any other person has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chesler.
According to him, the false feeling of pride that a person can “abstain all night” is still widespread, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, enough sleep of good quality is the “secret weapon” of a student to cope with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat excessive weight, as malnutrition translates the brain into hunger, causing him to experience a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course, visiting one of the courses last year during his first year of training in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduates to have a similar training program before entering a competitive training institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students establish a building warning that they should lie down and sleep, and that they remember the harmful effects of blue light, e-screened and light-emitting lamps, which violates human bioarthritis and leads to sleep problems.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Randers": Gol Menga wins the team of Gerard
Rangers had a regular sad trip, since the goal of Dolly Menga led the unassembled team of Stephen Gerard to a 1-0 loss in Livingstone.
Ibrox's team was hoping to win its first victory after a 4-1 win in St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerard as a 18-game manager, leaving his team at eight points behind, giving the Harts team an easy victory to the Scottish Prime Minister.
Manga killed seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost the spirit, apparently, were not going to balance the account.
While Rangers now dropped to sixth place, Livingstone rose to third place, and only Hibernian joined in relation to the head killed.
Also, Rangers may have additional problems after the head wound has been treated by a linear judge, Kalum Spence, after an object has been thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements in the team that passed through Er in the semifinal for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went along with the same Libya 11 strategy, which led to an increase in the Harts gap last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-managed composition narrowed the opponents at every step.
Rangers, they may have been leading the sword, but Livingstone was more likely to survive when the ball hit them.
They had to be shot naked in just two minutes when the first transmission of Meng Scott Pittman stopped Alan McGregor, but the defendant took advantage of the chance.
Kigan Jacobs had a criminal attack on Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgou was only able to send a ball to the side of the stand.
Rangers took control, but in the last third, it seems there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to be beaten for forty-five minutes when he and Steven Louless met, but Judge Stephen Thompson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
Rangers made only two hits in the first time, but the former doorman Ibrax, Liam Kelly, was not concerned about the hit by Lassan Kulibali's head, and the weak blow of Ovi Edjaria.
Although Libya's first goal, which was killed at 34 minutes, may not match the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own work.
But again, Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs's game with the standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave up the sword to Scott Robinson, who was trying to transfer the sword to Manga for completion.
Gerard began acting at a break when he changed Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and such a change almost immediately resulted in the final half-guard to give Morelos a passport, but the impressive Kelly slipped off his line to capture.
But Livingstone continued to attract visitors to the game they were thinking about, with Litgou and Halket, making long transfers.
The Holt team was trying to increase the fracture at the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgou gave the transfer from the field.
Rangers, Glenn Midlton, repeatedly called for a fine after he met Jacobs, but Tomson refused again.
Almanac: Geiger Accountant Designer
And now the page of our almanac "The Morning of Resurrection": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany this day.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger accountant.
Having become one of the foundations of science, Gaiger's accountant has also become one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film "Colocola Kornodho", with the likes of Roman Rogers and Dale Evans, which would seem to be non-scientific in the main roles:
The human being says, "What's the matter with this thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger accountant, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you trust these scientists, you can really hear the effects of the atoms that give rise to radioactive activity in the minerals.”
Evans said, "That's right, that's right."
Hans Geiger died in 1945, not only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see anonymous cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill an anomaly growing cells
Part of the treatment of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognise abnormal cells
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them into laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, cells are able to “see” the type of protein that is typical of many types of cancer, and cells should then be re-treated.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who has been introduced to this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize anomalous cells has been in the remission phase for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the patient's immune cells and change them into laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins, which are typical of many cancers, then the modified cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Vifesa, Maryland states: “The results we have received include a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancers”, including the cancer of milk iron, ova, light and colorectal cancer.
A similar method has been successfully used to treat leukemia. It has been used to reduce the immune cells in patients and their “learning” how to react to cancer cells.
Kanje West took the lead in the defense of Trump in the MAGA trap after his appearance in SNL.
It's all bad.
Kanje West was raised in a studio during a Saturday concert, where he spoke up for US President Donald Trampa, claiming that he would take that position again in 2020.
Following the performance of his third song, entitled “The Country of Ghost”, which he performed with the "Make America a Great Again", the executive spoke against the Democrats and supported the Trump.
"I often talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support the Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have gone from America for a long time," the executive said.
The SNL channel staged a parade with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Cavano's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on statements by Christine Blaise Ford on sexual harassment.
On TV, they did not show how the crowd was upset about West, but this video was uploaded into social networks by Chris Roque.
Now it's not clear if Rock tried to take this step off West.
Wester also complained to the public that he was being ridiculed after the scenes.
"They were kneeling to me on the stage.
They're saying don't get out of this hat.
They're really begging for me!
Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, “And they still said that my position is not cool.”
The West continues, "Do you want to know what's not cool, put on the superman's pay so that no one can tell you what to do?
Then you will need love."
His comments, at least twice, drew the attention of the audience, and the SNL actors seemed to be disillusioned, and one person said: “All the studios were loaded in silence”.
Westa was last invited to replace Ariane Grande's singer, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Macmiller, died a few days earlier.
Many have succeeded in performing Westom’s song “I Love It” in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA Candis Turner group, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the bravest people: SPASIBO FOR the support of many”.
Karen Hunter's lead show wrote on Twitter that West was just "who he is, and it's absolutely remarkable".
“At the same time, I don’t want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, divides and distributes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
"So do we," she said.
Prior to the start of the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now “formally known as the Kany West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and walk on the feet of Diddy, also known as Paff Daddy, Paffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, the repertoire Snup Dog originally had the name Snup Lion, and as another example, it is possible to bring an executive who has recently become a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempts to commit murder because of the footing in the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Balikhakamora, as reported by the police.
The respondent is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The allegations will be considered by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Player Game Star Kit Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known as John Snow's sword-breathing in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO "Game of thrones".
However, a recent 31-year-old actor who was hotly criticised by a hero-cat stereotype said that such characters often make young people think that in order to respect you, they must be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said he believed that “something went wrong”, and asked how to solve the toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently got married to her colleague on the game of thrones, Rose Leslie, her equivalent, admitted that he was “very uneven” to this problem.
“I personally take this question seriously: where have we made a mistake with the perception of courage?” she asks.
"Why do we teach grown-up children that we have such a problem today?"
China believes that television can be partly blamed for this sudden toxic courage because of too much muscle.
The actor continues: “What is born, and what is acquired?
Why do they teach on TV and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should show only one particular side of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question is, how can we change it?
Because today with young people, there's really something wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the games of the thrones after the series ended next summer, stating that he had “ended with battles and horses”.
Since November, Kit has played a major role in the re-re-shooting “True West” Sam Shepard, who tells about the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently announced that he believes that a meeting with Rose's wife is the best final "Games of thrones" for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my next life,” said the actor.
Rose played the gamer — the passion for the character of Kita John Snow in a fantasy series entitled Amy’s Honorable Award.
Para noted the wedding in June 2018 in the home of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
Only about 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
The overwhelming majority of new cases of the disease were sexually transmitted, as evidenced by changes in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusion.
However, the number of HIV infections was almost zero, Chinese health representatives said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, due to the country's conservative values, 70-90 per cent of men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the lack of protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters rejects information on the escape of information on the guilt of senators of the Republican Party, complaining about “hazardous lie” and “the theory of a conspiracy”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, denied the charge on Saturday that one of her staff posted personal information to three US senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The L.A. Democrat claims that the claims were made by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“The lie, the lie, and the more false lies,” says Waters in his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the address and number of United States senators, Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Uta.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the hearings of the Senate commission on sexual harassment against the candidate in the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano.
The escape took place some time after three senators questioned Cavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the communications was linked to the Waters office, and reported information on the Waters staff, reported Hill.
“This unwarranted claim is absolutely false,” Waters assures us.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds was in no way responsible for the escape of this information.
This unwarranted assertion is a complete lie.”
The Waters statement was immediately criticised on the Internet, including by the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flesher.
“This is an angry denial,” says Flasher.
“This means that the author has a temperature not suitable for work at the Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why are you angry?
And you don't have to justify yourself.
And you shouldn't dig in the prosecutor's motives either.
We need to stay calm and cool."
Flasher seemed to have compared Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavano, whose critics accused him of being too evil during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republic of the Republic of Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
In his statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these frauds.
“We will make sure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they bear the legal responsibility for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous to all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English is striking again — a weak parody of the Rowan Atkinson spy
Today it has become a tradition to look for Brexit's meanings in any new film in which Britain is somehow represented; it also refers to the new Parisian espionage of Agent Johnny English, whose production began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with Agent Johnny English: re-download.
Will the self-defense picture with the "evident that we're all fucked" become a new attempt on national exports?
In any case, the Englishman Johnnie had his right to chaos for the second time, his name clearly implied that he was a broad-screen comic book designed for a non-English cinematographic audience.
Hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his remarkable claims in the glamour, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bin's drawings and a portion of this guy, who made a single note of the song Chariots of Fire in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveller and the challenging “International” Atkinson, once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, in which the hero left behind full chaos.
In this last edition, JE has one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English came to the helicopter, dressed in middle-agedness, and the shovels were lying on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates the gift of Atkinson for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but humor itself seems rather weak and strangely excessive, especially because such “serious” cinema samples as “Agent 007” and “Mission is not complete” are now certainly offering comedy as an element.
It's such a feeling that jealousy is meant for children, not adults, and for me, the amazing crimes of Johnny English are not as inventive and appropriate as those of Atkinson in the movies about Mr. Bine.
The permanent mission is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker penetrated the top secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the duty agent, Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, became an episodic role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, an angry and hard-hearted figure already suffering from a huge political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the Quasi-Terez-May character, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors told her that since each active spy was compromised, she would have to get someone out of retirement.
And here on the stage is the unencumbered Johnny English of his own character, who now works as a school teacher in some art institution, but also gives informal lessons in secret operational work: here are some good jokes, because English offers the skills of a rock-style spy academy.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency instruction and is reunited with his former unsuccessful friend Baff, who is playing Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who is under command of the submarine, a role of "sweet hockey kluss," in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
Thus, Batman and Robin are back in the game because of the terrible mistakes they have made in the secret service of Her Majesty, and they are faced with the beautiful rock woman Ofelia Bouletov in the performance of Olga Kurileenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the authority of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims that he can solve the British computer problems — the predator Jason Walt, who is playing for Jake Lacey.
The English and Buff are starting their parade jokes: masked under the officers, they are burning the French restaurant; they are creating chaos, smuggling themselves on the Volta luxury yacht; the English is born with a complete anarchy, trying to use the virtual reality charm to get to the interior of the Volta house.
All these scenes, of course, are a nice and tiring idea, but there's something very childish about it.
It's a very moderate thing.
And, like in the case of other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: can't the British cinema industry give Rowen Atkinson a role that is really proportional to his talent?
Laborists deny that they are planning a reduction of the British working week up to four days for five days' wages
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin is going to consider the radical plan that British will work four days a week, but will be paid in five days.
The party is reported to want company managers to hand over the savings received as a result of a revolution in the field of artificial intelligence to the workers by providing them with additional outputs.
This would allow staff to enjoy three-day benefits for the same salary.
The sources reported that the idea was “introduced” into the party’s economic agenda and would help the country’s population to become a part of the workforce.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
The high-level source of the Laborist Party said The Sunday Times: Policy revision is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen at the same time, but the four-day working week is our goal, which is consistent with the party's approach to changing the balance in the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, since the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, it is not currently approved by the majority of the Laborist Party.
The representative of the Laborist Party said: “Four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered a party”.
The Senior Chancellor John McDonnell used the Laborist Conference last week to specify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to expel power from “unscrupulent directors” and “speculators” of municipal companies.
The firm's plans also mean that the current water channel shareholders may not get their share back, as the Laborist Government may do “twisted” on the basis of alleged errors.
He also confirmed plans to include company directors in the Boards of Directors and to set up the Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector firms to work that could receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Grem and John Kennedy report "60 minutes", whether the FBI's investigation into Cavano might change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bretta Cavano held a final vote on his appointment as a Supreme Judge at least weekly and asked whether the Agency's findings could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Cavano.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60-minute correspondent, Scott Pelley, interviewed the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Grem, whether the FBI can find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Not at all," said Kennedy.
“I went to the meeting and said I was talking to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, and I got this information, and I said, "Did you do that?"
His answer was firm, firm, and clear.
But Grem's opinion in voting remained unbearable.
“I am firmly determined about Brett Cavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by action comparable to dynamite,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I do know is that Brett firmly denied all of this," added Grem, addressing Christine Blasi Ford.
“None of those whom she called as witnesses could also confirm these facts.
It's been 36 years.
And I have not noticed a new thing in it.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual musical event featuring an impressive star with at least an impressive mission, the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year, as part of the World's Citizens Festival, tens of thousands of people have reached the Grand Duchy of the Central Park, but not only to benefit from the speeches of such performers as Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes, but also to share the present objective of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was opened in 2012, is the continuation of a global project to combat poverty, conducted by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), you had to participate in voluntary activities or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other important actions to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the 12-year World Citizens Festival been in achieving its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free visit to the concert that they are actually convinced of calling for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” when people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages to Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that more than 19 million “actions” carried out by its supporters have been registered at the festival since 2011.
It is recalled that by this action, world leaders have promised to allocate more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group sounded 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its action, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that funds provided direct assistance to almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the most significant commitments is The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementing specialists committed to “helping children fully discover their potential”, promised Rwanda to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in the district, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices about the lack of food for past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Panel also stated that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to encourage the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through improved nutrition activities.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end up with extreme poverty?"
The organizers of the Global Citizen reply: "This will be a long and difficult path that we will have to meet and fall from time to time.
But, like in large movements of civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardy B, Jeanelle Mone, are some of the artists who will take part in this year's New York event, and will be the lead of Deborra Lee Fernness and Heu Jackman.
United States of America may use a military fleet for the purposes of “blocks” to prevent the export of Russian energy: Minister of Interior
U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke said that Washington could “as necessary” resort to the assistance of its naval fleet in order to prevent the fall of Russian energy on the markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that the presence of Russia in Syria, particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a suggestion to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as much as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are some ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, is able to ensure the openness of maritime routes and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” the Minister said.
Zinke addressed the participants to the activities organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial group that positions itself as the “voice of the energy user” in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective use and fuel exchange,” says the Minister, calling Russia “one-stop truck”, whose economy depends on fossil fuel.
Statements were made that the Trump Administration had tasked to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Tramp Administration officials, including US President Donald Tramp himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” North Stream-2 pipeline project, which, according to Trampa, made Berlin a “guardian” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the North Stream-2 project, worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The United States position called for a negative response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the Federal German Industry (BDI) called for the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes in our energy supply, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after the recent meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Senator of the state Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will carefully explore the potential for presidential ballots in 2020
The senator of the state, Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, announced on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibility of balloting the President after the interim elections.
At the town hall in Holioque, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would think of participation in the pre-election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and “start” our broken government, and for this “top” a woman is needed,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of balloting with the President.”
Warren thus appreciated President Donald Trump's activities during the meeting: “He is leading the district in a wrong direction”.
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both the Trump himself and his candidate for the post of Judge Brett Cavano.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Federally, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not think that it should be bowling in 2020.
According to a survey by Saffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre, fifty-eight per cent of Massachusetts ' s “probable” voters said that the senator should not get involved.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed him.
Other well-known names of democracies discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden argues that he will take an official decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sara Palin told about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Pailin at a meeting with voters of Donald Trampa
Trek Palin, 26 years old, served in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son, who has returned home, is now living the same as other family members who have suffered the effects of PTR and wounded, and our soldiers are returning with the injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “with a white eye” and said about his son and other veterans of war, “They are coming back to others who have been slaughtered, wondering whether their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other soldier they have brought back from their country have been treated with the same respect.”
Trak Pailin was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and charged with family violence against women in the situation of violence and possession of arms in the state of alcohol abuse, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 States, the province of Colombia, support the challenges of a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the Colombian district support the legal challenge of a new United States policy that prohibits the provision of asylum to victims of refugee or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district provided an analytical note to Washington on Friday to the court's counsel on the support of the asylum-seeker who is in doubt of the policy.
The full name of the complainant in the application for Grace v. Sessions, submitted by the American Union for Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civil husband “and his sons in the criminal group” had subjected her to ill-treatment, but on 20 July, US officials refused her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers in support of Greece said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala had made a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new policy of the United States on asylum-supply was annulled by the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents protecting against domestic violence to make an application for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Carl Rasin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “neglects decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the Judge Counsel said.
Lawyers also claim that the policy prohibiting the entry of immigrants is harmful to the US economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provides the necessary labour force”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sashns ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum for victims of domestic or gang violence.
“The asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political convictions,” Seshns said in his statement of 11 June.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pala: the number of deaths doubled in search of survivors
The situation has become increasingly difficult for survivors.
“It’s very difficult now,” says 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusum, comforting her sick baby at the evacuation centre of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, prompt assistance will bring the wounded.
Pure water in the great affliction."
The residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals affected by an earthquake of 7.5 have been overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who had a vertebral and shoulder fracture, were resting near the army hospital in Pala, where patients were treated in open air, because they had to leave the room because of the constant strong thrusts.
He was crying, remembering how the earthquake had destroyed the number in the hotel on the fifth floor, which he had recorded with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed into the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream and ask for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope that they are saved and are all well with them."
The US Ambassador accuses China of “accused” by “advertising advertising”
A week later, after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad in a daily U.S. publication about the mutual benefit of trade in the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread the propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in the state of Iowa, in an attempt to interfere with China in the US Congress, which will be held on 6 November.
The truce that Beijing is attempting to intervene in the U.S. elections is a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials have informed the Reuters agency: there is a new phase in the increasing Washington pressure campaign on China.
While it is the norm for foreign Governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of the trade war, which makes them equalizing tariffs for imports from their countries.
China ' s responsible tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to defeat exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic of Trump, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, claims that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, says Branstad in an article published in the resurrection magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this grass by placing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Government of China enjoys the precious heart of our American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and posting advertising in Des Moines Register,” says Brandad.
“Even so, in newspaper kiosks here, on Beijing streets, you will hardly hear different voices and not see the true diversity of views Chinese might have learned about China’s alarming economic policy, because local media are under strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of China's most famous newspapers had “debt away” from the proposal to publish its article, although he did not bring the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: the Kawano range of Republicans removes female voters prior to the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain on the side and defend the candidacy of Supreme Judge Bretta Kavano, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that a negative reaction is being observed here, especially by women who may have an impact on future interim elections.
The emotions surrounding the situation were all the same, and most of the Republicans formally declared that they wanted to continue to vote.
That is not the case later, says Grant Rier, professor of politics at Maxwell’s school at the University of Syracuse, in his article published on Saturday.
Rier is doubtful that Senator Jeff Fleeck (R-Arizona)'s attempts to conduct an FBI investigation in the last minute would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget about it tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierer, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters called for November ahead! On the contrary, the Senate, when the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee, decided to put forward a candidacy of Kawano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blassy Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the framework," said a non-party politician named Stu Rottenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation is already very strong, and that is true.
But everything can get worse, especially with regard to women voters in suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly protested against the candidate as a senior judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirm the move, this step could lead to a response.
“It’s already an mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steel, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, as NBC News reports.
“This is not only about voting in committee or final voting or whether Kawano has been sitting on the scale of the defendants, but also about how the Republicans deal with how they belong to it,” says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose democracies, a news channel.
However, Americans seem to have split up a few on the question of who to trust anyway — Ford or Kawano, and to hear more on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford's statements exactly or most likely, while 35 percent said that they believe in Kawano exactly or most likely.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kawano lied at the earliest or most certainly at the time of his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
According to Fleica, the FBI is currently investigating the charges for Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore in the Legal Committee of the Senate that Kawano, being in a state of torment, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that a candidate for a senior judge showed her her genitals at a party during her education at the Yel University in 1980s.
World Wide Web Designer plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Li, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inruptt, is a company based on an open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and how to give people access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, the goal of Inrupt was to gain “world domination”.
“We have to do this now,” he says about his start-up.
It's a historic moment.
The annex uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal data storage” or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, calendars, music library and other personal and professional data-processing tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — everything can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data repository is that it is fully managed by a user who can obtain access to any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal development of rights and opportunities through data”.
According to John Bruce's CEO, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently comprises Berners-Li, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several state developers with whom the project contract is concluded, and the community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Li said that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google on whether his companies needed to make radical changes, which would completely change all their business models.
'We do not ask leave of them.'
In his post to the Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet, creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the vote of Berners-Li sounded quite impressive in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Fund and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next Internet era,” says Berners-Li.
Bernard Vann: Church servant awarded the Victorian Cross during the First World War
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded the cross of Victoria during the First World War, and this event was noted in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellengiz and Lóukur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so he never realized that he had won the highest British military award.
The memorial in honor of this event was presented Christmasly by his two grandsons on the parade in Rušden, Northgemptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "significant", that the monument was opened 100 years after his grandfather received his award.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann carried out his battalion through the San Canten Canal “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire of field weapons and rifles”.
Later, he threw himself on the fire line and led the group forward with “greater courage” and then with one hand dropped the field gun, beating three troops of the unit.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, hearing more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old grandson Michael Vann said that “he could hardly do the same heroicly, but it calms down”.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put in place a vein at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra, Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honour for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the strength of a real hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people”.
MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead showed them Peppu pig
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you didn't get to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 battles, including six main program battles, which were broadcast all night in a direct air on 5 British television channels.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were ready for the meeting, the British patients were shocked, seeing the Peppa Pig screens.
Some of the patients were not quite impressed, for they did not sleep until the morning just to see the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change of the message to a child's multimedia “some sick joke”.
“There was a state decision that this content was inappropriate for 6 hours tomorrow, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President Bellator on marketing and communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Peppa Pig."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said that they were planning to make a schedule so that future battles could also be viewed by viewers from Britain.
"As for the re-show, I think we can solve this issue," said Koker.
"But there will be a Sunday, six o'clock tomorrow, and we will not be able to resolve the matter until a Sunday after our time, and it will be for them on Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Believe that when the message was changed, a number of text messages fell off, and they were all far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that it was a matter of public importance.
I promise I won't do that the next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but it's got a turn.
Yes, it did not work well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily experienced a feeling of lack of appreciation for her sexual orientation
Olympia driver Tom Dale says he's growing up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize that “not all of them are like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that the victory at the Olympics was becoming less concerned with him after he had a baby.
The permanent leader of Kirsti Yang's multi-year show took a few months off because of his illness.
Dale, who was the main guest in the Laverna programme, said that he felt “better than any of the peers”, because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both boys and girls.”
He said, “These feelings of worthlessness and impatience have been real to this day, but they gave me strength, and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something" so that not everyone would be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
A double bronze Olympic medalist became a known LGBT activist, and this year he called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality at the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said that the feelings of the man, US director Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, “remained in his career”.
Last year, Dale married Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, but claims that the difference in age was never a problem.
“If you are so young,” he went to his first Olympics at 14 years of age and his father died three years later, “it’s hard to find a rival who has the same heart - to - heart - opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dale said that "all his world-wide perceptions" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win the gold medal," says the sportsman.
"But you know, there are things and more important gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale told us that his father did not want to live up to what he was dying, and one of his last requests was that they were tickets in the first series of London 2012 competitions.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be around any more, and you won’t be able to sit there in the first row,’ says Dale.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” said the sportsman.
The following year, Dale participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life, that it was not a better feeling before a crowd of fellow Olympics,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 in English summer time.
Mikelson, who's not in shape, spent this Saturday on a rock by Kubka Ryder.
American Phil Mikelson will set a record on Sunday, played his 47th match, Cupka Ryder, but he will have to raise his form to avoid an unpleasant wave.
Mikelson, who played at the biennale on the 12th record, was sent by Captain Jim Furick on Saturday for four matches and Thursdays.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time major winner divided his day between watching the game and working over his own field game in the hope of correcting his concerns.
Never had the directest hit, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old sportsman was not the ideal candidate for the Le Golf National race, where the long raf is usually punishing for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mikelson in the ninth match on Sunday will meet the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined the new Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12 single match make a bitter start, the Mikelson match can be a decisive one.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, although he could still say so.
“He fully understood the role that he is playing today, caught me in the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Ferik.
"He's pretty confident about himself.
He's a hall of praise, and he's done so much for these teams both last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's how it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Mikelson will win the record of Nick Faldo's number of matchmates in Kubka Ryder.
This may mark the end of a career in Kubque Ryder, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven none, although Ferik said his presence had little benefit to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to train people, and he's a great guy who's interested in," he explained.
“I think that this week young games were fun with him, and that was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Björn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant solitary leadership in Cuba can easily turn into an unfavourable side.
Datchanin competed in the game in 1997 in Valderram, where the team headed by Severjano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but overcame the finish line only to hear ahead with the smallest difference, won with account 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
“You continue to remember that we have had a great advantage in Valderram; we have had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we have lost, and in Valderram where we have won, but just now,” said Bjorn, printed in the photo, after viewing the 2018 Class, won on the Le Golf National with an account of 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in an account of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
You're going to go full tomorrow.
Go and do the right thing.
Until there are no eyes on the board, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and it's a chance to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I did not speak in silence, focusing on the 12 games of our team, but we know so well that what we stand against is against the greatest games of the world.”
Happy as his actors made their golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have been more than this.
Another test awaits us tomorrow.
Individual statements are starting tomorrow, and this is quite another matter.
Always nice to be with your partner when things go well, but when you stay there alone, you experience all your professional golfer's strength.
That is exactly what it takes to get the players to put them on the table tomorrow.
Now the partner stays behind, and he should also make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferik, believes that his games will be better than his partners, except for Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who have taken three points from four.
Farik himself has gone through all this carousel in the last few days, becoming part of the winner team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe held the "Medine Wonder".
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 game, was involved before the last day.
"We have 12 important players tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it as soon as possible, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the match.
We have properly designed our plan for the game and we have arranged the people as we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we will try to create a miracle."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory McKilrow at the top of the game with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I have selected such a group of guys, and in this way, because I believe that they will thus overcome all possible shortcomings,” Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
Implementation of the new German military ship has been postponed again
The new German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this would not take place at least in the following year due to inadequate systems and price growth, local media reported.
The launch of Rainland-Pfaltz, the main ship, is completely new to the Baden-Württemberg class, now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit newspaper with reference to the military representative.
The vessel had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen since the delivery had made the fate of the ambitious project difficult.
Four Baden-Württemberg ships, scheduled by the Navy fleet in 2007, will be replaced by the older Bremen fleets.
As far as is known, they will have a powerful gun, a number of Zenite and Anti-Crobile Missiles, as well as some of the “stels” technologies, such as reduced radiolocation, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of the deployment of new frescoes for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay in the entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to distribute its power abroad, are already getting older by the time they enter arms, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 crashed into news headlines last year when the German naval fleet officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the shipowner after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and equipment defects”, which made the warship useless in the use of combat.
The lack of software was particularly critical, as Baden-Württemberg's courts would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the working force on the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its productivity and limited its ability to introduce future updates to the IMF.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne Rainland-Pfaltz twice the heavier ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong equipment, the cost of the whole project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of retaining the core of the new frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings of a reduction in the military-sea power of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartelles, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that military and maritime forces had actually “ended the stockpiles of ships capable of deployment”.
The officer said that the problem had become acute over time because the old ships had been taken out of operation, but their courts had not been granted replacements.
He visited that none of the Baden-Wurttemberg guys could have been armed by the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flying Mouse
A new study carried out in one of Scotland’s hotels has the task of showing how flying mice use the landscape in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data received would allow a re-view of the behaviour of unique milking wings and help in further conservation activities.
The study organized by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will examine ordinary bats, soprano bats, as well as the brown long-term flyers and Dobanton nightlifes that inhabit Inverewe Gardens, West Ross.
Special registries will be established at some points around the site to track the flying mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile local surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the types of activities for which the various groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the environment will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to establish a detailed landscape picture of their conduct.
Rob Dur, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show which sites are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main directions for the management of the habitat environment, such as the formation of meadows, as well as the way to maintain forest masses, optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The populations of flying mice in Scotland and throughout Britain have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are at risk of disappearance due to construction and development activities that affect their habitat and the loss of the habitat environment.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may pose a risk, as well as a sticker for flies, chemical processing of building materials and hunting of domestic cats.
In fact, flying mice are not blind.
However, their night catch habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching.
They use a complex eco-location technique to accurately identify obstacles to the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is very serious about the population of flying mice.
Ten experts have been trained in the organization, who carry out regular surveys, visits, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even created the first and only reservation in Scotland of the flying mice in Thrave in Damfris and Gallowee, where eight of the ten species of Scottish flying mice live.
David Thompson, the real estate manager, said that the name was an ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Thrave, a great place for flying mice,” he says.
“Here are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good housing environment.
But many flying mice remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need for a good existence.”
He recalled the importance of checking the presence of flying mice prior to the provision of technical services within private ownership, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of 400 individuals and young people, and perhaps even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, injury or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Flying Mouse Conservation Fund, calls on the public to help.
She said, “We need to know more about our flying mice, and we do not know how many of them live.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to trial in the German journal
Christian Ronald denies the charges brought against him by rape, calling them "felical news", and claiming that people simply want to "probate", using his name.
His lawyers are going to trial the German news magazine Spigel, who issued a charge against the footballer.
Forvard Portugal and Juventus were accused of rapeing the American on behalf of Catherine Mayorg, who allegedly took place in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375 000 to talk about the incident, reported on Friday at Spigel.
In a video in Instagram, where a football player has 142 million signatories, a few hours after reporting on the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information a “feiqué news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've told today is all fake news, says the five-time winner Ballon d'Or on the camera.
"They just want to go for a walk using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, my name speaks, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and I've got a great one," adds a sportsman with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are willing to file charges against Spygel, which they called “inadmissible information on confidentiality suspicions”, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz stated that the game was intended to seek compensation for “moral damage to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Upon meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorga reportedly returned to the playroom, where he allegedly raped it in an annal form, according to documents submitted to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged Ronald accident, he fell on his knees and told her that he was "99 per cent good guy, but was one percent bad".
The documents claimed that Ronald had confirmed that the couple had been engaged in sex, but that was in agreement with both parties.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial solution because she felt “fear that she would be vindictive” and feared “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence, as she continued to experience the painful feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to Italian giants Yves in a transaction of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain is sorry for the automakers who have been lost forever.
The Minister of Business and Enterprise Greg Clark said that Britain would “suffer for all time” if after Brexit lost its world leader in the field of car production.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK reported to BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer stated that the effects of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to job losses.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis plant in Bernston produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," says Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, in the absence of a Brexit supply chain transaction, autoproducers would be at high risk.
The Toyota production line is launched “in due time”, and the details for the cars made for the order are supplied to UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, Britain leaves the EU without a deal, there may be losses that, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and delays.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to keep the stocks at its plant in Derbishira for more than a day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan, called in Checkers, on future relations with the EU, was “discalibrated precisely to avoid these border checks”.
"We need a deal: we want to make a better agreement that will allow not only to succeed at present but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future," he told BBC Radio 4 "Today".
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers claim that we must be able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to specify the time limit for which production would be stopped, but in the longer term, it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Cwallaris, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years and was the head of the trade union, said that the concern of members of the organization was growing: “If we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to return them”.
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The Tramp meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to the White House
The responsible meeting of Donald Trampa with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “transferred to another week”, as the fight for Bretta Cavano's candidacy continues to be a top judge, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is sponsoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the contacts between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential obstacles to justice by the President.
If the Trump of the Deputy Attorney-General were to resign, thereby endangering the independence of Muller, a mass of suspicions has been raised in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of the channel for recording talks with Trump and the President ' s impact on the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejects this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “do not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate judicial committee, where Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasie Ford gave testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation into the FBR's complaints in Kawano, which further held a full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sara Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press in the course."
Some journalists object to this claim: Sanders has not had a briefing in the White House since 10 September.
The leader Chris Walles was interested in why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not caused by the “respect for the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they are playing in the audience”.
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President meets more in response to journalists’ questions than any other president before him,” she added, but she did not bring the exact figures, “We have these figures.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.”
We're trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's a decent press briefing."
The Trump regularly answers questions from the White House by attending public meetings or press conferences with high-level individuals.
The conference exclusively for the press is a rare one.
The President ' s strange conduct in front of the gathered journalists this week in New York may be the answer.
The Minister of Health addressed EU workers in Scotland with a letter on concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health asked EU staff working in the Scottish GHG to express appreciation for the country ' s name and wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Gin Freeman, MSP, addressed staff members less than six months before leaving the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of making statements of status for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit continued during the summer, and this autumn should be a possible solution.
However, the British Government is also strengthening the preparation for a possible scenario with no transaction.
I know this must be a very alarming time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is, of course, your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercromby underwent an emergency surgery regarding head trauma
Michael Ordinance of Tennessee reported that the Tennessee State Tigers semi-defenser Christian Abercromby had undergone an emergency operation, having suffered a head injury on Saturday after the 31-27 defeat in a match with Vanderbillt Commodores.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma had been received shortly before the interruption.
"He came to the side line and just walked there," said Reid.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercromby oxygen on the sideline before placing it on the lifts and taking it to medical examination.
The official representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercromby had undergone an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/grade of the injury”, and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercromby, only in the second course, it was the first season of Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully took over five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher herb collection when purchasing real estate in the United Kingdom.
In line with the new Thori plans, the foreign buyers will receive a higher herb collection in the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom and the additional funds allocated will be used to assist the homeless.
This step highlights the failure of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
Increased herb collection will be taken from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Treasury expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds per year for homeless people
Foreign buyers will receive a higher return on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced today by Teresa May.
This step is not in line with the efforts made by Corbin to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to increase the income of citizens.
The increase in herb collection will be taken from individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus allocated should encourage the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
An allowance to the existing herb collection, including an increase introduced two years ago for the acquisition of secondary and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects that this step will allow up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estate facilities are purchased by non-British residents, leading to price increases and making it difficult for buyers who bought their first apartment to improve their housing conditions afterwards.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “stard cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, when buying housing here, spend most of their time abroad.
A new policy was developed a few weeks later, after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in herb collection to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of undermining real estate prices by purchasing land, but not actually using them, and urged Ms. May to give up the quota for affordable housing to correct the “construction-building” situation in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and termination of unwarranted eviction.
He would also like to give local authorities more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year, I said that I dedicated my prime minister to the British dream to make life better with every new generation.
And that, including, also means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that for non-British citizens as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as affordable as it is for business-loving British people.
Too many people dream of getting their own home too far, and the danger for some is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland."
Boss Sunderland Club Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become a Scottish manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased with the re-establishment of the North-East Club, which is now taking the third place in the first league, separating from the three-point championship.
This summer he moved to the Stage of Light after St. Mirren returned to the Scottish League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got the B hat, and everything," Ross Sportssound BBC Scotland said.
“But I grew up looking at my father in Scotland in Hampden as a child, and that always drew me back.
However, this will only be possible if I can become a successful club manager.”
The predecessors of Ross, the managers of Sunderland were also Dick Advocaat, David Moies, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic said that he did not experience threefold such authority names in such large clubs, previously rejecting the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
According to its structure and possibilities, this club certainly belongs to the Prime Minister,” said the coach.
“Get him out there is a simple task, but I will consider what I have done, only if I can get the club back.”
Ross has been in the manager's office for only three years, first becoming a manager's assistant in Dumbarton, then spending 15 months in the hearts training staff.
He then helped Alloa get up from the third level and in the next season brought St. Mirren out of the lower positions of the winner of the championship.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably the present crossroads”, he recalls his responsible work in Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that management was more suitable than a game.
That sounds strange, because I did everything right, worked well in that position, and achieved some success.
But the game is more complicated.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good at being a manager.
I always wanted to lead, and now, by doing so, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life."

The summer heat increased the sales of British pubs, but reduced the sales of restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July and fell by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, which received this statistics, relates: “Sustainable solar activity, as well as longer than expected, participation in the world’s championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs grew by 2.8 per cent, and in restaurants, on the contrary, significantly decreased”.
The fall in income in restaurant trade by 1.8 per cent was also continued in July.
The pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results compared in restaurants.
Dads who sell only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not so much as restaurants.
It's hard to think that people want to jump on the street just to miss a bottle.
The sale of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month and food by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM in the field of leisure and hospitality, says: “These results continue to be the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain critical when it comes to sale in the loss market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, as sales drop of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to the ongoing price pressure.
The long hot summer has proved to be as never before for food operators and not yet the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give the necessary transition.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including reopened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowing of branding.
Sectoral sales monitoring Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes the productivity of 47 networks with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is a recognized industry benchmark.
Each fifth child has secret accounts on social networks that he hides from parents
According to the survey, each fifth child — some 11 years of age — has secret accounts on social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the Facebook insta pages
This news raised concerns about sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a basic account that parents know about
However, each fifth child, some of whom are 11 years old, creates accounts in a network that he or she hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake “inst” accounts, i.e. Instagram, a website for the exchange of photos.
This news raised concerns about publications of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of students said they had a basic, clean account that their parents had access to, but they also had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally had access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, turned to a teenager who called on others to “defile him”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in the network, and half of them recognized that one of them was usually secret.
HMC Head Mike Bukenen says: “Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is a disturbing fact”.
Elid Doyle will become the "voice of sportsmen" of Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scotland's Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle, Scotland's most titled sportsman on light athletics. President Yen Bitty argues that this step is an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the extensive experience of sports at the international level over the past decade.
“Alid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and the world's light athletic community, and we are confident that it will be a great benefit to the light athletics in Scotland,” Bithy says.
Doyle says, “I try to be a voice of sportsmen, and I hope that I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 games in Atlanta, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a regular commentator on BBC, has lost his ability to walk after the stroke.
He writes in his Twitter: "The month ago, I had an stroke.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that it would only take time to see if I could fix it, and if so, to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I was completely healed, learned to walk again, and I am doing fishing today!
Thank you so much for your support."
Advertising of milkfats in which nursing mothers compared with cows divided the views of internet users
The dairy production company caused Internet disputes, publishing an ad that compared breast-feeding mothers to breast-feeding cows.
By placing on the market, they say, “the world’s first sound-free breast milk sauce”, the consumer technology company Elvie published an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milk sauce provides to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a full haystack under a musical track, saying, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed it, it's my breast."
And also, 'We feed and we feed our children with milk; we feed and we feed.'
This advertising role, which was published on the Facebook company's website, caused disputes on the Internet.
77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments: the video received a mixed response from the audience, and many say it sheds light on the “fears” of the dairy industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, except that their children take them for a few days after birth," says one user.
Elvie's milk sauce is put directly under a special bottler (Elvie/Mother)
And here's another comment: "It's obvious that it's as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But why not use them to advertise milk sauce for mothers who leave their children? "
Another user adds: “Reclamation depleted from reality”.
Others, on the contrary, protected the role, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just magnificent”.
"I think that's a great idea.
If I were to feed a kid, I'd have to buy one.
I've actually had a heart attack that made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a little busy, but it feels about it.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """"" """""""
And another comment: “A lot of advertising that is intended for mothers who breast-feed (often they do it directly at their workplaces or in toilets) and who, in truth, feel a little “boiled.”
It's not for us to admire or abuse our dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these undetected milk sauces hidden under the bisthalters.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast - feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk sauce is completely insensitive, has no pipes or tubes, is free to be placed in the bistgalter for feeding, and without any intention of giving women the opportunity to move, hold their babies and even go out in the streets during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and expert on early development of Mother’s children, comments: “The Elvie Moloco sauce is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative advertising.
We wanted to draw the focus on breast-feeding and all its problems, while demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that gives new milking.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk sauce gets in the headlines of the news.
During the London week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage of the designer Martha Jacobovsk, using this product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children were safely moved to the tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detainees has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children at the post office.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same non-documented immigrants and are afraid to threaten their stay in the country, under the authority of the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential commanders and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been asked to take the leave of minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Approximately 80 per cent of persons who are either contracting agents or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a significant part of them are aliens who commit a crime.
We therefore continue to persecute these people," Olbens said.
In an attempt to speed up the child-forming process, officials introduced new rules whereby some of them were required to appear before the court within a month of detention, not within 60 days, as was the case.
In order to claim their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present on video, not on their own.
Those deemed to have no right to help will be deported quickly.
According to shelter and information workers who have appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to be alarmed or depressed, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are increased in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them the emotional time to prepare for it or to say good-bye to friends may add to the trauma that many of them are struggling with.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Valid al-Moual also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war had already taken place in the country for the eighth year.
Moala, also a Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegal in Syria on the pretext of combating terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he said to those who had gathered.
Mualam insists that Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have been expelled from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” by terrorist groups and “lovely illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who speak against President Bashar Asada.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 military personnel in a war-affected country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been established for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “distributing irrational insurance” that urged refugees to stay outside the country.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what must be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until the political agreement on the end of the war between Assad and the opposition is reached.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large area of the Idlib rebels has provided an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a massive attack by the Russian-supported Syrian forces in a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline”, and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadians, including the Al-Qaeda-related fighters of the Nusra Front, who would “be destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hoped that the first meetings of the new committee would soon be convened, consisting of representatives of the Government and the opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Mulam pointed out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “the consideration of articles of the current Constitution” and a warning against interference.
Why Trump wins second term
In line with this logic, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020 if the impression and scandal do not soon complete his presidency, and that is what many liberal observers are likely to expect.
And this will, of course, be “the very dramatic finale of the presidency for all history!”
At this point, there is no sign of sighting fatigue.
Since 2014, the premium-time ratings have increased by more than twice — up to 1.05 million per CNN and nearly three times — to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million premium viewers, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" exceeded the cable channel ratings, collecting 3.5 million viewers in the evening screens during the main news show.
“This is a fire to which people are drawn, because it’s outside our understanding,” says Neil Barr, director of the ABC’s “Appointed Survivor” drama, a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Sköll, a long-published comedian writer and author “Only funny: several unpleasant truths about the entry into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” offer a different theory.
She recalls once driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, “Yes, because he is ridiculous.”
There is something valuable in all this chaos — it's fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the content broadcast on TV, Washington's summary lines can determine the future of Rou v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of bringing immigrant families together and the health of the world economy.
The exception is a luxury that can be afforded only by the most privileged viewers.
And yet, when you've already seen a six-hour-long group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of a "deep background" for his Strah" book, or about Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 from a strip of skin (a suit, warmed tops), as Washington Post writes, or about a sharp description of Storm Daniels, let's say, Mr. Tramp's anatomy, it's already out of the ordinary awareness.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“ Partly his job is to make us feel that the reality of the show is to feed you on something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Pawn Stars, about the changing actor's composition of the Tramp show and the daily affairs of the subject (drake with N.F.L., praise Kim Chen Ihn).
You can't let yourself miss any episode, or you're hopelessly left.
When I contacted Mr. Fles this week, on the north coast of Kauai, there were 27 degrees of heat, the sun lit, but he hid inside his home and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, at least not exactly when they showed what Brett Cavano was before the Legal Committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," says Mr. Fles.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Foreign money is involved in the worst intermediate elections leading to the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow through a change in districts in Congress, where two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed for so long, supports democracy, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Connor Lemba, who took place in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is speaking against another current official, Republic of China Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially in conflict with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that, as a result of pre-election maniments, the old areas had been assigned to the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The Honka in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate on financing campaigns between the main financial forces — the Committee of Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lemba became known in Pennsylvania after the victory with a small difference in the March special elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by the Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won the district, with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give the democracies little advantage.
United States of America ordered El Salvador to support China, but then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had led to a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama. He was also in Panama until the partners expelled the management team of the Trampa organization.
The representatives of the Department decided to withdraw US leaders of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent non-recognition of Taiwan”, announced in the beginning of this month the Press Secretary of the Hezer Nawart Department.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed criminal sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for that country in Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
In the light of the regular internal meetings of North and Central America, the representatives of North and Central America held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held in order to review the outcome of a similar meeting that took place last year, which was perceived as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the high-level representatives of the Administration had indicated that they wanted the preparation of the conference to take place, and had actually discontinued its consideration of the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be held by Vice-President Mike Pens, indicating that the Administration is of real importance to this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new severe messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate that had been discussed by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirm the foreign analyst who was present in the administration but also spoke in terms of anonymity.
Study History
The next step could be to report to Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible impediment to Mr. Tramp's justice, as there is very substantial evidence in the public reports.
Mr. Muller also reportedly began to investigate the facts of the trump campaign with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If the Congress changes the owner, Mr. Trump will appear before the person responsible in that body, just as he is prepared to speak again before the electors, and perhaps eventually before the jury of his colleagues.
But there is a lot of "ifs"; I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to set up a coup and overthrow Hitler, and this would happen if the West gave him resistance and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so and have missed the opportunity to avoid subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history is being developed at such points, and the impeccable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are experiencing some of these fractures now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he proposed to keep secret records of the President ' s activities and discussed his inappropriate position last year.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavano is not complete or true, or if it is nevertheless approved of the position of a Supreme Judge despite the merit of being accused of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we in the medium term vote for the Congress, which will bring Mr. Tramp to justice?
If we fail to pass these tests with dignity, this winter will prove to be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to go through them with the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovenian Jew, who lived in the same Nazi regime in Osvenci, whose officials once occupied the post office, where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later I was led by a Saturday candle on a table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past as I can't be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eizen, senior scientist at Brookings Institute, is president of the City of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of the book The Last Palace: A troubled Age of Europe in the history of five lives and one legendary home.
Grem Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the race against the Rapid Veneto football club.
The Rangers take the Venice Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive victory in Spain over the Willerreal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe.
For the first time, the knee trauma has prevented the shoulderguard of Graham Dorrans from reaching anyone in the season with 2:2 against "Villairreala", but he believes that "Randers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve greater results.
"That was a good time for us, because "Villareal" is a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We got into the game, thinking we could get something, and we got out of nobody.
Maybe at the end of the day, we could handle it, but in general, no one was probably a fair outcome.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success came to the second time where we were better.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the patients, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly a difficult one, taking into account all my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
The composition is excellent, and the people really get the pleasure from it; the workouts have gone to the clock.
I hope we can move forward, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of their pension stocks
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear view of how they wanted to be cared for, few had talked to their family members about it.
About half of those participating in national studies said that they had discussed the value of long-term care with their wives.
However, only 10% said that they had talked to their children about it.
“People want them to care about someone in the family, but they don’t try to discuss this with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide for Life Insurance.
And that's exactly what we need to start with.
Speak to your spouse and children. You may not be able to prepare your family until they care for you if you do not speak beforehand.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will get medical assistance, as this choice may be an important cost factor.
Consult your financial consultant: he will help you develop a payment plan for this expenditure.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property, provided you have money.
Put your legal instruments in order: get rid of legal battles.
Build trust in medical care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and monitor your professional wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend considering the possibility of financial confidentiality.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts if you prove unable.
Don’t forget about small children: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Can you then provide information on the medications he is taking and on what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper to prepare for each case.
Martin adds, “It is important not only to have financial resources, but also to choose doctors.”
“What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Build up and write down this plan."
In Ilfracombe, a person fired several times from a pneumatic valve
The man fired several times from the pneumatic vent, returning home from the funnel.
The victim, whose chest, life and hand were shot, was 40 years old in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 in English summer time, as “an accident”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounds are not life-threatening, and the police are now searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunamis that struck the Indonesian city of Palou on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
As a result of the outflow of communications, rescuers cannot receive any information from Donghal, a region north of Pala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with 7.5 balls.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Pala as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Pala and Dongala located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Salvador, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (given for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a district that extends 300 km (180 miles) to the north-west coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, the administrative area of the smaller province, had 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Salvador, and in particular the coastal region of Dongala.
The production of nickel is also important for the province ' s economy, but mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster relief agency, the tsunamis have been destroyed several times in Pala and Dongala over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
The tsunamis also occurred in the western part of Dongala in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Volcanic Fire Engine and is suffering from earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that devastated 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The aftermath of the severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing tsunamis on the south coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: Earthquake 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake of 7.5 bullets occurred on one of the islands of Mentawa in Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 feet [10 m] that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake hit the Pidi Jai district in Aceha, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake in 2004 and tsunamis.
The tsunami did not happen this time, but more than 100 people were killed as a result of the destruction of the buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia Lombok, resulting in the deaths of more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily remained in ruins.
Senior son of Sara Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor Alaska and vice-candidate of President Sara Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, entering a situation where domestic violence occurred and resisting arrest, according to a statement issued by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked the phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is in the Mat-Su insulator and will be released at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he was asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “unique innocence”.
Pailin is threatened by the introduction of three minor Class A crimes, which means that he may be deprived of liberty for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with the offence of Class B, which was sentenced to imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first case where criminal charges have been brought against Pailin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Aliski Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, undermining the report on domestic violence and the storage of arms in a state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after explaining her son ' s brutal behaviour with post-traumatic stress disorder, as it was reported in his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died as a result of an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
Earthquake of 7.5 balls caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred not far from central Sulavesi, which is north-east of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
There are video recordings on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunamis broke down on the beach.
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office wishes to issue a rare death sentence to the suspect in New York
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office in New York seeks a death sentence for Saifolo Saipova, suspected of committing a terrorist in New York, resulting in the death of eight persons, a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, a 30-year-old man, reportedly took a ride to the Home Depot to attack the West-Syed Road in Lower Manhattan, riding pedestrians and bicycles.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intendedly” killed eight people and “intendedly” caused serious bodily harm, according to the announcement of the intention to obtain the death penalty in the South of New York.
According to the court document, the two charges may result in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read Saipov ' s indictment with 22 counts of charges, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of rockets commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of cars.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “very planned and intentional”, Saipov carried it out, as described, “in an abhorrent, cruel and criminal manner”.
"Syfullo Habibullahevich Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anna Laura Decadta, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlia, Erna Ferruci, Erna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnukko," says the announcement of intentions.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since a death penalty was imposed by the prosecutor in the South District of New York for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, Halid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug addicts, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty on the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenbergi was sentenced with the use of an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, the native of Uzbekistan demonstrated that there was no injury after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by IGIL video viewing on the phone.
He also asked the IGIL to hang the flag in his hospital room, reported to the police.
He denied his guilt on all 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the side of Saipov, said that they were “clearly disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor’s office.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, rather than the life sentence, without the possibility of release, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all their participants,” Patton said.
The defence of Saipova had previously appealed to prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
A member of Parliament from Tori said that NAYJEL FARAZ should not be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Faraz conference, he vowed to “mobilize the People's Army”.
Former leader Ukip said that policies should “sympathize” with Eurosceptics, as one of the members of Parliament in Teresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bown, said at a meeting in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have been "getting out" if Mr. Faraz had been Secretary Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Mrs. May, in trying to reconcile her deep-separated ranks, is further aggravated by the fact that members of the Tori party, who are opposed to leaving the EU, join a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister of all forces is trying to maintain his compromise plan, which was called at the Chekers in the crackdown by Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that she continue to try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite a negative reaction, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and its chaos.
Mr. Bown said at the Leave Means Leave (means to survive) meeting in Solihalle, which he wants to “play Checkers”.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have gone out," he said.
Deputy Wellingboro added, "I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play the Checkers."
Addressing the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wished to remain is totally inconsistency”.
Brexit from the Tori Andrea Jenkins party was also at the meeting, giving reporters such a comment: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
“Chequer is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually pushing the streets and, above all, choosing us.
Please put the Checkers aside and start listening to what they say."
In her brief address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain in their work if they are faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if policies are to be handed over to the 2016 referendum, they must be “recognised”.
“This is now a matter of confidence between us, people, and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to deliver Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let this go of your hands."
Addressing the frightened crowd, he added: “I want our political class on the edge of Brexit’s betrayal to feel naked.
“We are mobilizing the national army of this country, giving us victory in Brexit, and we will not be calm until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit's opponents took a demonstration on Birmingham, followed by a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists have been blowing the Tori v. Brexit posters into these outputs.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Laborist Party, Lord Adonis criticised the conservatives for security problems in the mobile annex of their party.
“And these people claim that they can set up IT systems and technology Canada plus, for border work, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"This is a complete side.
"The good Brexit does not exist in principle," he said.
Warren plans to “carefully explore” the opportunity to participate in the presidential race
U.S. Parliament member Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would “determine the potential for presidential ballots”.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusets democracy on Saturday told about its future at a meeting of rats in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trampa, is protesting in November against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Dil, who was co-chaired by the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There are talks that she has the chance to take the post of Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, she held a regular meeting with voters in Holioque; since Trump entered the post, it was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a rattush meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to be the president.
Warren replied that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to “start” our broken government, and for this to take place as a woman.”
As a result of the murder of Sims (starred), the LSU player was arrested
The Baton-Ruž police, Louisiana state, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder of LSU Wade Sims, who took place on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 a.m., the Baton-Ruz police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old at the English press conference.
On Friday, the police department published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was able to download the video.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot at a South University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayd Sims received a gunshot wound in his head, which resulted in his death,” the officer of the Murphy J. Paul Police told reporters on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was involved in the incident, had weapons and shot at Wade Sims.
In the arrest of Simpson, he did not resist and was arrested in the East Baton-Ruz police department.
The young man grew by 1 m 82 cm in Baton-Ruz, played 32 games with 10 starters in the past season and took on an average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 choices for the game.
Gran Pri Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of the world champion after the command tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Walter Botts went through the qualification on Saturday, Louis Hamilton said it was clear that the Mercedes command tactics played a major role in the race.
From the pole-post bottas he was well-initiated and practically shot at Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammates.
The fettel first went to the pi-stop, leaving Hamilton in the tail of the whole group - a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went to the foot-step one round later, and then went behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel struggle, went ahead, leading the Ferrari driver to unavoidably leave the inner space free, risking being stuck after a double movement to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of a series of nets and was in the seventh place until the end of the first round.
Then he took most of the race, held on to his native tires, in order to quickly finish, subjugated Kim Reykkonen to fourth place.
As a result, he went to the foot-step of the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds, as Rickkonen took fourth place.
The day was difficult because Walter had done fantastic work on the exits and had shown the present glory by sharing it with me.
The team has done such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock," Hamilton said.
Prejudice language of gestures
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Finnstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her statement that she had not published a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, the accused of Brett Cavano, a candidate for a high-level judge in sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention direct testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, he said that the Senate had shown that participants in these events were “slow, ugly and false people”.
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what is happening in the Senate in the last few days, is wonderful, it is anger, evil, hatred, and lies,” he said.
'You see all these running away,' they will say, 'No, I did not do it.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you "sweet" the information?
Remember her answer... did you "seal" the document information? - "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't swear.
Yes, stop.
We, what, did we "slid"?...No, we didn't "slid", he added with the senator's ink.
In July, Finnstein was sent a letter detailing the charges brought against Ford against Cavano, and in early September it was unlawfully announced, but Finnstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I did not share her information,” The Hill said to the Committee.
“She asked me to keep this information in secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the charges in the run-off was apparently not pleasing to the president, who commented on this during the Saturday session: "This is what I will tell you: the language of the body has been very much influenced by it.
Maybe she didn't "sweet," but the language of the body was worse than I've ever seen."
While continuing to protect his candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, accused by three women in sexual harassment, the President suggested that the Democrats use those charges for their own purposes.
“They are certainly trying to regain power in all available ways.
We are watching for pride, malice, no matter who they try, who they have to overcome to gain power and control," the President quoted Mediaite as saying.
British elite hockey league: Dandi Schart 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for "Jeants" in the game against "Dandy"
In the game of the Elite Hockey League, Dandi Schart was awarded a Friday victory against Belfast Giants, winning a response match on Saturday with a 5-3 account in favour of Dandi.
"Jeants" received an early victory in two goals thanks to the hits of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Duyer took the "Jeants" out to the leaders.
François Bushar compared Dandi's account before two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Kif, who won the "Dandi" with account 2:1 in Belfast on Friday evening, this was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting between the parties in the season when "Jeants" won three previous matches.
Duyer's first goal came at 3:35 a.m. after Kendall McFall's naked dog with David Rezerford's support, after which Bovilleer doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markhardt trained Kouni to balance the account at 15:16.
Duyer was satisfied that the Giants had taken over the initiative at the first break when he shot the second goal at night at the end of the first period.
The master regrouped, and Bushar reassessed the account, killing the naked man with a number of sentences at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Corcoran were united to help Nilsen to give Dandi the first chance to take the lead at the end of the second period, after which he and his team won, holding rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The "Jeants" who have lost four of the last five matches are currently being sent to Milton Kanes for the next match to be held on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people aboard the aircraft could escape earthquakes
The Indonesian airman was sentenced to death by a hero after he deliberately died in order for hundreds of passengers to be able to fly well.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives as a result of a severe earthquake on the island of Sulavesi on Friday.
Strong underground thrusts continue to destroy the area, many of the inhabitants of Palu have fallen into ruins of buildings.
Although his colleagues were saved by escape to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrendous airstrip of Mutiar Cis Al Jufrey, the city of Palu.
He remained in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then in the airfield, was able to fly safely.
Then, when he found out that the elevator was breaking down, he jumped off her.
Later he ended up in the hospital.
Indonesia's aviation representative Johannes Sirait said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to deliver it to a large hospital in another city.
Regrettably, the dissertation ended before the helicopter was able to sit in Palo.
"We are very sorry about this loss," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of people killed as a result of the earthquake may reach thousands, since, according to the Agency for Disaster Reduction, access to the cities of Donghal, Sigi and Bhutan is limited.
“The number of victims is probably growing, as a large number of people are still under siege, and many have not been able to get out of there,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, whose heights were six meters [6 m] high, devastated the city of Palu, where the mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “Quick assistance will bring the victims every minute.
Clear water's not enough.
The mini-markets have been robbed all over the world."
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross workers are already hurrying to help the survivors, but we do not know that they will remain there.
Tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but everything can be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and spoke before the country's armed forces, in particular, said: "I ask you all to work day and night in order to fulfill all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lomboca, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person has failed to drive after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, on its way to the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, when it was said that all 47 passengers and crew were well off.
The Air Niguini report states that as a Saturday, it does not have any information on one male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the police, trying to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and aircraft crew after he fell on the water trying to land at Chuk Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The causes of the plane crash and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airlines and U.S. V.S.I. claim that the aircraft landed in the lagoon not far from the airfield.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the airfield.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane's getting on the airfield is too low.
"And that's very good," adds Janes.
Janes told me that he and other passengers had managed to get on a ton plane because the water level was on the belt.
He also told us that the stewardess panicked and shouted on board and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. I.S. reports that mariners repairing the vicinity also helped to rescue by using an inflated boat on which they transported people to the shore before the aircraft was loaded about 30 metres (100 feet).
The Flight Safety Networks show that over the last two decades, 111 people were killed in aircraft accidents with aircraft registered in PNG, but none of these accidents were related to Air Niguini.
Analyst analysis could prove the fact that a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charge was brought against the man accused of burning the Mississippi resident in 2014.
The analysis of the Department of Justice of the United States, Paul Roulette, gave a long-term testimony as an expert witness in the field of analysis.
He told members of the department how he used cell phone records to form a general picture of the action of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette explained that he had received data on the location of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, Televis spent the evening with Chambers, which contradicted his previous testimony, reported The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to his cell phone, it was near Chambers, and when the situation became clear, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was right, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie, because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, they were called only within one week, according to the telephone records.
Roulette also showed that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, she had removed her text messages, phone calls and contact information from her phone.
"He's the star of her life," says Heil.
Protection should begin to set out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a "known hip-hop"?
Three hip-hoppers are going to fight negative attitudes toward this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group in Brussels claims that hip-hop content has changed by removing the original political and social problems.
The group wants to return to their roots and again make the “conscious” hip-hop popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently witnessed a return to Britain by such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?
New York Ninja tried a family couple because of racist sms.
The New York Nanny tried a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a communication from a woman with a complaint that she was “one more black”, which she mistakenly sent a Nanny instead of her husband.
The wives deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim is “for the purpose of persecution”.
Lucy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern, knowing that the new bride offered by the care service for children, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family on her first working day in 2016.
"Not so much as this, one more black," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexman to her husband.
Instead of sending a text message to her husband, however, she twice mistakenly sent his wife, Maurice.
Aware of her plight, Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, claiming in service that an African-American girl had done a bad job, and that they were expecting a Filipino rather than an African-American, reports New York Post.
Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris now sues a family couple and demands compensation for a $350 discharge per day for six months, in accordance with the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not entered into by any contract.
“I want them to understand: such things are not allowed,” she said on Friday, adding, “And I know it’s discrimination.”
Spouses disagree with the charge of racism and claim that the dismissal of Morris can be considered a reasonable step, since if they tried to do so, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she really didn’t mean anything.
She's not a racist.
"We are not racist," said a husband, Joe Plasco, in Post.
Would you trust someone with whom you had no desire, even if you had no desire?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Let's go!"
Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and had become “in the face of a difficult situation”.
"Are you willing to follow the man who has been in this state?
It's not very nice of you," added a bank employee who specializes in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but the public opinion has already given its judgment on social networks, accusing a couple of unacceptable behaviour and logic problems.
Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not be able to walk with a talking bear, says a new letter
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, responded to the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the first reader, even before it is published.
It's very fun to know that Paddington has a huge success."
She also told her father that, before he decided to write a children's book about a nursing home, he worked as an operator on the BBC and that he would refuse to publish with optimism, and added that his 60-year-old anniversary was “and joyful and bitter” because their author did not become their author last year.
As for Paddington, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family”, and her father quietly boasted that his character had finally gained knowledge.
"He was a quiet man and a humble man," said his daughter.
“The way Paddington was so real to him, and it was almost as if his own child had made a success: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider it a success of his own.
I think he was referring to the success of Paddington in that way.
Subdington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always gave due honor to the bear.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone
After her plane was landed, her daughter was taken to Niccia Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried very hard to save her life.
“The crowd called regularly and said that it was really bad that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
“So he called again and said that she was going to die in the next two minutes, and that we had to say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually stopped acting by abandoning her body.
She died earlier than she expected.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold my hand firmly."
At the end of the day, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, the grief of losing her daughter, landed on the plane with other passengers, calming down the huge loss she had just had to survive.
"No one around knew what happened," she says.
"My head came up, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but that's what I've been trying to do during the flight to Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who survive the loss of loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are on the Wells Bridge openings with comforting words and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he began to experience depression, and at the age of 18, he died with him.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day, ” she says.
The 45-year-old Davis, living in Lidney, tells us that her son was a great cause and had a hell of a smile.
"They all loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was like a light burning in the room."
However, before he died, he left his job because he had a really scary time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler finished finding his own family brother, then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm not going to stop being afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis has come up with these openings, "Perhaps people knew there was someone to talk to and tell, even if it was your friend.
You cannot sit down and remain silent, and you must speak to people."
Mrs. Hamfriz, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who lived with him for 15 years, not soon after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, upset, or something like that,” she says.
“In a few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his attitude.
It was a very bad thing for him to be born, and he did not look upon his children when they opened their gifts.
She says his death was a huge injury to them, but they had to go through it, that event shocked our family.
It broke her into pieces.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Future Bretta Cavano hanging on the fibers: FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could get something of what he asked for — an investigation limited by time and volume, we could bring even a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “break” into the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kawano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
Intermediate elections will take place only five weeks, November 6, and if, as expected, everything will be bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the Supreme Judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kawano, who has been working in the White House for Mr. Bush since then, and who thanks to Bush, met his future wife Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pens to address the issue of equality of vote and to confirm his candidacy as a Supreme Judge.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased by Kim
Since Kim Chen Yin came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased, the South Korean legislator said.
Pak Bion Seug, referring to the South Ministry, said that, compared to the 2706 escapes recorded in 2011, this figure decreased to 1127 cases last year.
Mr. Pak said that the key factors had become the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China and the higher rates taken by smugglers who exported people.
There are no public comments.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a securely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often subjected to forced repatriation.
The relationship between the North and the South, still in war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Beijing to resume negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the June historic meeting of the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump and Kim Chen Yn, in Singapore, where they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Rie Yun Ho, accused the United States of obstructing progress in this matter with its sanctions.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” said Mr. Rei in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano “a hysterical” and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the Palace of Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano, a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, “esterical” and said that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t imagine that if a woman ever allowed herself to do so, she would be immediately referred to as “a hysterical”, says Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony of Kawano in the Senate Legal Committee, given to her on Thursday.
Kawano emotionally denied the charges of Dr. Christine Blasi Ford in sexual harassment, which apparently occurred when they were both teenagers.
Cavano spoke emotionally enough, even screaming at times and breathing, telling about his family and the school years.
He also duly condemned the Committee's democrats, calling charges against him “grossy and clearly planned killing of the active person”, organized by the Liberals, who were concerned that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Kawano's testimony only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a pre-eminent relationship with the Democrats.
“I think he is disqualificating himself with his allegations, as well as with the way he leans on Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
Palosi was upset when she was asked if she was trying to bring Kawano to justice, if his guilt was confirmed, and if the democracies were to receive a majority in the Chamber.
“I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only worthy of the Supreme Court, but also of the court where he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kawano is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kawano regarding the Law on Accessible Medical Services or Rou v. Wade, since it was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavana raised the question whether it would be possible to repeal some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time to put an exorbitant and a prettier man to the office of a Supreme Judge and to cry out, 'How wonderful!'," said Pelosi.
And women should own it.
It is righteous anger, months, and years of anger; it cannot pass through without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," said Miss Stein 45 later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She continued: "The woman who worked for me in the leadership, she told me that she also wept when she was angry, but developed a technique that she explained to her companion: "You can think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really upset."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
The tears are allowed as an exit for anger, partly because they are being treated incorrectly in the corn.
One of my most painful memories of the first work in the office where men dominated: I once cried out of anger, but I was caught by an old woman's shrivel, a soulless manager I've always been afraid of, and pulled out on a ladder.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"But they know not that thou weepest of evil.
They think you're upset, and they're glad they finally brought you back."
Patricia Shreder, then a congressman from the Democrats in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught up in some unserious plot and got out of the race, and Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason for her to interfere with the President's position.
“This decision was not considered,” she said with a smile 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Belosnejka and seven gnoms."
The campaign has come to an end, it has left much behind in the collection of funds, and therefore it has sworn that it will not participate in the race unless it collects $2 million.
It was said that it was a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who had given $1,000 to men, had offered her only 250.
She said, “What am I to them, the treasured goods, or what?” – she wondered.
When she spoke out that she was not going to conduct an official campaign, she was so touched by the emotions of the people who supported her, by the disappointment of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, and by the anger of discrimination on the grounds of sex that she had breathed.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“It was possible to think that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what would they write on my memoir?
"She cried without end?"
How trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first wave of trade between the United States and China was deafening, and although the battle is still far from completion, the gap between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning early this year, imposing a tax on basic Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected goods of $200 billion (150 billion) and actually taxed half of all goods coming from China.
Beijing has made an equivalent response every time, recently fixing US goods fees of $60 billion from five to ten per cent.
China promised that the responses to the United States would be equal every time, and the world's economy would hardly be experiencing at least the slightest difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to resign means to resign, but to give up the United States in public would be too careful for Si Xinpin, President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic shock in any of these countries is in fact much more dangerous than previously recognized observers,” says Abigail Grace, a research officer of the Center for New American Security, who specializes in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” to return to refugees
Syria claims that it is ready for a voluntary return to the refugees and is seeking help in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
At the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Valid al-Moual reported that conditions in the country had improved.
“Today’s situation on the ground has become more stable and secure due to the success of counter-terrorism efforts,” he said.
The Government continues to restore destroyed areas by terrorists so that people can live there peacefully.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country have now been established, which they had to leave due to terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the assistance in restoring the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not receive assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe Strengthens the Victory of Kubke Ryder in Paris
The European team won Kubok Ryder 2018, winning the U.S. team from 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The dollar has been played six times on European land, and the European Rider Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe has returned to the crown with the command of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who has taken 14.5 points to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikelson, who fought a lot of the tournament, made his first long shot in the water at the 16th hole in the pair-3, with his match Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, became 1-x-4th players who had ever attended 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit suffered a 5-4 match with the lowest score in the European team, Turbarian Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, resigned 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in Cube Ryder for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Kubkov Ryder, became the winner of a tournament for the whole history of Europe with 25.5 points of career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold on today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," says Emotional Garcia after European victory.
He's handing over the flag to his associate John Ram, who won the victory on Sunday over the American legend of Tager Woods with a 2:1 account in a single game.
“I’m extremely proud of this victory,” says 23-year-old Ram, “and I’ve grown up watching the game of Tiger Woods.”
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These indicators are quite strange for one of the biggest players of all time winning 14 main titles, with only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. assembly fought during all the weekend, trying hard to win, and Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fina, who had a golf course throughout the whole tournament, were selected.
The U.S. captain Jim Furick said after his inconsistency statement: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we were able to touch Europe easily.
It didn't work.
We're taking the traps before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played great.
We are regrouping, I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee of the Cube Ryder, and we will move forward in our quest for success.
I love all 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to be able to play.
We have lost."

Red tides are also observed in the Pasco district.
Last week, the average concentration in the Pinellas district was reported and near it, from low to high concentration in the coastal district of Hillsboro, high concentration in the Manata and Sarasota districts and coastal zones, medium concentration in the Charlotte district, high concentration on the coast of Li district, and low concentration in the Koller district.
In the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Li and Kolier districts, there is still a likelihood of respiratory irritation.
No such probability was reported in North West Florida last week.
