Large assembly representatives are concerned that they will "seem as Muppeti"
Some assembly representatives (Assembly Member, AM) proposed that they be called representatives of the Great Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MWP).
This was due to plans to rename the assembly into the Grand Parliament.
Congregational representatives from all political spectrums were concerned that they could become the subject of a verdict.
A congregation representative from the Labour Party said his group was concerned because the name is "brought with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: on the big twp means stupid, and pwp ass.
The representative of the council of the Party of Wales (Vol. Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and presented alternative solutions.
The Great Conservative said his group was "open" to change names, but that MWP could be quickly converted into Muppet.
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing a law to introduce a change of name, announced the following: "Of course, the final decision on how to title the representatives of the assembly will be on their own."
The law of the government of Wales of 2017 has given the Grand Chamber the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that have gained broad support for changing the name of the assembly in the Belgian Parliament.
When it comes to what representatives will be called in the assembly, the Committee was inclined to call the "members of the Great Parliament" or the MWPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support during public consultation.
Members of the Assembly propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to a better outcome for the President of the Elin Jones Assembly, who is expected to put forward a proposal for a law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Law will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of representatives of the assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
During the discussion of the law, the congregational representatives will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to a referendum on the change of country name
The voters will vote on this Sunday if they want to change the name of their country to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents its own Greek territory and repeatedly opposed the launch of its EU and NATO accession procedure.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that the change of name is a simple price needed to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell was silenced while the churches in Harlem fought for survival.
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past there could be a bar and a church on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"There is no one else today."
He said the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are joining today in another way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of a neighborhood in which people live regularly."
When it comes to churches, then, it is concerned that money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and " sooner or later it will be found at the beginning."
He added that the churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where they would live people who would not help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood.
"Many people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "so you will be faster when those churches are completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who have settled in these buildings will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held the temples nearby took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin took over a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson on the head, who led a boycott of merchants on a small 125th street, the main street for buying in Harlem, which opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
The 1939 fire seriously damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned its reconstruction, they ordered a series of bells, called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of the father Johnson and successor of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July used the second term: "cultural goods" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was also the first carillon in the world in which black musician Dionisio A. Lind played for 18 years at the larger carillon in the Church of Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is being played in St. Martin over the past few months is a story about architects and performers of construction works, some of which have been brought by the lay leaders of the church, and others of the episcopal diocese.
Sacristija, the governing body of the parish made up of time, wrote to the children in July because of the concern that the child will "continuate to transfer expenses" to the Sacristi, although the Sacristi was not involved in the engagement of architects and construction workers who sent the child.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the child.
Marine dog injured 13-year-olds during diving for lobsters in California
According to official reports, a marine dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while riding a lobster in California on the day of opening the fishing season on the lobsters.
The attack took place some time before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said at the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he ran with friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boys' call for help, and then led the group to the attack site to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he at first thought it was an excitement because of the caught lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone was broken.
"I hesitated to get everyone out of the water: 'In the water is a sea dog!', Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to a children's hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The kind of sea dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the rescue team Larry Giles said at a press conference that the marine dog was seen in that area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of marine dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamia in Ecinitas for the purpose of carrying out the investigation and security of the buyers.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK’s beauty market
Sainsbury’s became a competition for chains such as Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic plates in the style of factory houses and by hiring specialized sellers.
As part of a major entry into the UK's market of beauty worth GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow compared to the drop in sales on the market of clothing and household equipment, larger cosmetic plates will be tested in 11 trades across the country and expanded to additional trades next year if shown to succeed.
Investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways that supermarkets try to use space on police that was once intended for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including the first time and trade marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And existing assortment companies L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space with areas for certain trade brands like Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its assortment of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger buyers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, a fragrance dealer Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s shops, the first one that was opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second one that opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net purchases and return to daily purchases of small quantities of food in local food stores mean that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Director-General of Sainsbury, said that it would look more and more like a factory house while that supermarket chain is trying to resist the favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidle offering a larger number of services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced outlet Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats units because he bought both chains two years ago, which he claimed to encourage the sale of nutrients and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s joined the joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended up fighting about sharing the revenue from the drug in its supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury’s three years ago for 125 million GBP sold its pharmaceutical business in the 281 store of Celesiu, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy.
He claims Lloyds will play a role in the plan by classifying a range of luxury skin care products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance and perception of our departments with cosmetic products in order to provide our users with a more favourable environment.
We also put in special training a colleague who will be at the disposal of the buyers and give them advice.
Our assortment of trademarks is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and the available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to changes in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "crazy" after Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds.
Dragon’s Day Peter Jones's star was left to "cook of anger" after the TV leader Holly Willoughby quit the 11-million-pound contract with his trade mark to focus on his new contracts with the Marks & Spencer and ITV chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of household clothes and fashion supplements Truly.
Their trade mark is compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trade mark.
This Morning (37) show's head on Instagram announced he's leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragon’s Day show star to cook out of anger by retreating last moment from a joint profitable business to focus on his own new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources claim that Jones was "slow" when a golden girl on television during a tense meeting Tuesday in his business kingdom headquarters in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts were worth up to 1.5 million pounds means that there is no longer time to devote themselves to their trade brand of household clothes and fashion supplements True.
That job was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trade mark and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to pull herself out of the way has affected everything involved in that job.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to the start of the whole line.
In Marlow's headquarters, there's a lot of stuff that's ready to sell."
Experts believe that due to the departure of this Morning, one of the stars in Britain that is the most affordable to invest, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in products in the range of pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing and the possible additional delay of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as president of the administration in March.
Couples spend vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S trade mark ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of ITV's I'm a celebrity.
The source of closeness to Jones said last night, "We do not want to comment on his business activities."
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love
He complained about the criticisms he would get in the newspapers because of comments that some might consider to be the "unsufficient president" and because he has such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give so many concessions?"
he said Trump, reflecting the voice of the news manager.
"I didn't give any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been suspended.
More than three months after a meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's main diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north did not notice the "responsive" US response to the nuclear activities of North Korea.
He noted that instead of that, the United States has not yet abolished the sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be lost.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results – the cessation of pilot missile launches, the relief of hostages and the return of the remaining American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act as president, but instead of waiting in front of this full arena for 10,000 people, we'd have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a bunch of people right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a little problematic," Mrs Sumbun said.
Although the Save the Children organization is a team that will travel to Pal, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in aid efforts.
Given the continued support of the land in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to bear the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis are built in Aceh, it is not something that is usual on other parts of the coast line.
The absence of siren to warn on the tsunamis in Palu, although the warning was in force, was likely to result in a loss of life.
And at the best time, traveling between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The hospital ship that was anchored in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake was on its way to Paul, but it took him at least three days to reach the scene of a new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's decayed structure was the foundation of the election campaign of President Yoko Widodo and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the government under Yoko is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and next year new elections are held.
Joko also faces pressure from other sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting on the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hit a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shakiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal at 1:0 for Chelsea.
He moved the ball on his left foot before he shot her to the opposite stop.
The ball flew high above naked towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally ran away from Kepay Arrizabalaga who jumped towards her and went online.
"It was necessary to get to that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante come and I just touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led in half-time with 1:0 after the meeting of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The blue attacker passed the ball back to Mateu Kovacic during that game before he turned somewhere in the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic did a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful pass ball that had led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard went around the defense and hit the ball with his left foot in the net on the opposite stop next to the liver pool of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool is playing a club game against Naples in the League of Champions at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea awaits Videoton at the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, the State Disaster Office reported on Sunday morning.
The agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that a large number of people were reported to be trapped in the ruins of the building after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that felt on Friday and caused waves of heights up to 6 meters.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of ruins of fallen buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) for suspicion of murder after the woman was killed.
The murder investigation was launched after a female body found in Birkenhead this morning in Merseyside.
A 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police called on people from that area to call if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hogan said: "The investigation is still in progress, but I would like to see all those who were near John's street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is of key importance to our investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead and found in the building.
This afternoon at the scene, friends who think they know this woman came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation was under way, and the police said it was in the course and the procedure for reporting the nearest victim's family.
A cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him that no one can enter or get out of the building.
He ran out of words when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take a few hours until they can return to their apartments.
A cop reportedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at a crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 14:00 a.m. in the fenced area there were two police vans, and another one was parked right outside.
A large number of policemen stood inside the fenced area and monitored the housing block.
All those who have any information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, named 101 or to the Crimestoppers organisation on 0800 555 111, calling for a record 247 of 30 September.
Kip Cromwell in Parliament is the newest monument that took place in the middle of a debate on "the end of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts that his fanatic Puritan followers did.
But Cromwell's society has called Mr. Crick's attempt to "fool" and "try to break history".
John Goldsmit, president of Cromwell’s society, said: “In the debate currently being held on the removal of the statues, it was clear that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace became the subject of debate.
The iconoclass of English civil war is not something Cromwell ordered or did.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the procedures of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful revitalization of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the way in which the 19th century thought and part of the history of a person that many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell many consider, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, to be the advocate of the parliament from outside pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Is that a completely credible opinion the subject is a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of the Protector are still valuable gifts of honor and marks."
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China.
A man mentioned only by the name "Yuan" was found dead cut off arteries and blood covered near the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou published the South China Morning Letter on Sunday.
The pig breeder was about to be vaccinated by pigs in a pig in the Chinese province of Qinghai on 30 May 2005.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a pig weighed 250 kg to death bit the breeder.
The evening news of Guiyang says that a relative named "Wu" said, "My cousin's legs were bleeding and suffocated."
The security footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager said for the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent someone else from attacking while the police collect evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration are allegedly negotiating a fee for his death.
Although this rarely occurs, pigs' attacks on humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, the pig attacked her wife and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered injuries that were life-threatening.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighed 300 pounds [300 kg] and tied the big farmer to the tractor until his wife undressed the animal.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that blood taste can act as "a trigger".
"They're just played.
They're grinning, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa hurricane brings strong rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa is weak as it passes through the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But during the next few days, Rosa will bring flood rains in the area of North Mexico and the South West of the United States.
Rosa at 05:00 in the east time blew at 140 km/h, making it Hurricane Category 1, and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, it creates a low pressure area and moves towards the Western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture towards the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause the emergence of strong waves in much of the southwest.
In the local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous storms, mud storms and possible cliffs in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the formation of a dam of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
The rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain is possible.
There's no advice to go to the pedestrian desert because of the danger of tropical forests.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local storm winds and rainstorms.
Nearing the low pressure area will bring local strong rains on the parts of the coast of southern California.
It is possible to cause swelling in a quantity greater than 12 mm, which may cause less muddled holes and slender roads.
It's gonna be the first wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the late evening and Monday morning before the end of Monday and Tuesday cover the wider area.
A strong rain will spread on Tuesday in the area where the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touched all day long.
In October, large temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in small distances.
Sunday is a brilliant example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central US.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omahe in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the remaining summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
It is expected that most of the Central and Eastern US will be warmed from 27 degrees south-east to parts of the northeast in early October.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast points to a great possibility of above average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks testifying to the candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political accounts continued, and the reporters interrupted the regular programme to inform about the conversion in the last moment of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court board that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning witness that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
Friday's hearing was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in Nielsen's report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
He was not immediately available to the number of viewers for other networks that were broadcast by the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is usually in trouble with measuring the number of people looking at the contents of the offices.
In order to get you to know it better, it's about the audience that's a number similar to the one who's watching American football or Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported the Kavanauch's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day's hearing, reported from Nielsen.
ABC took another place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained great and after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After that moderate republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded that he was being shouted at by demonstrators while he was trying to go to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
A few minutes ago, he stood face-to-face while he was shot alive in front of CNN's cameras by demonstrators.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth in this country?"
They said to him, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had issued a notice before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks followed live when the Judicial Committee should vote on the direction of the Kawanaugh nomination to vote throughout the Senate.
But Flake said he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against candidates during the next week, which required the minority democracy.
Flakes have partially convinced talks with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve the Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of going out of the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit in another interview with her on the same issue, saying it was a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other with "full nonsense".
The murder of Waydea Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of LSU's death
Police arrested a murder suspect with the firearms of Waydea Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and detained under arrest for murder in custody, the Baton Rouge police department reported.
Officials posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and reported finding Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB reported, branch of CBS.
After the Simpson investigation, the police reported that he confessed to shooting Wayde and killed him.
A $350,000 security deposit is requested.
The City of Eastern Baton Rouge's death squad issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of the outbreak was a head wound through the neck.
The police administration thanks the working group for the fugitives of the federal police in Louisiana, the criminal lab of the federal police, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for implementing the law on "fighting and searching for the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
A wing player 183 cm tall grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps in the game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "depressed" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano throws ash into Mexico City
The ashes that discharge the Volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ashes over 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring multiple strangulation and suffocation.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ashes on windshields of cars in Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity of volcanoes, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since the magnitude of the magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in 2017.
Vulcan known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The conflict between police and Catalan separatists meets an annual vote on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters defending independence clashed with the intervention police and thousands of people joined protest demonstrations to mark a Catalan polarizing vote on withdrawal.
A group of masked separatists who were told that the intervention police began shooting policemen with eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
The fights were even later during the day when the police used sticks to calm the fight.
During a few hours of the group that advocated independence, they scandalized "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness", and on the contrary, the unionists called "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital due to easier injuries occurring during the demonstration, local press reported.
The tensions in the region that weighs independence did not come about a year after the referendum of October 1st, which Madrid declared to be a pro-law, and which the Catalan separatists are celebrating.
The majority of voters decided on independence, although the outcome was small, because those who opposed the vaccination were mostly boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in severe conflicts last year after the police tried to stop voting in polls throughout the region.
Groups that advocate independence spent Friday night on the street in order to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to proceed on another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness that they could vote, but now we're singing," he said.
Despite having achieved a key, although a decisive victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties are hard to maintain this year's momentum because their most famous leaders are in a self-appointed exile or in detention awaiting trial because of their role in organising a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was driven by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been investigating the prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Application for European elections is the best way we can recognise the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after killing a car in the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after several car hits in the house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday at around 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the yard doors and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point there's a single shot fired on the car.
Hit Menge brought Livingstone to victory over Rangers with score 1:0
First goal Dolly Menge for Livingston brought victory
The new Scottish Premiership League, Livingston, surprised Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat of the 18th game at the head of the Ibrox Stadium Club.
The Dolly Menge shot turned out to be decisive while Gary Holt's team was dealing with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a win in the Prime Ministership this season, and next Saturday they're playing against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind which eight points are behind.
Before that, Rangers in the European League will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone has been increasing its six-game series of victories, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced a defeat since Kenny Miller was replaced last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they hit it, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but there was a drag on the way towards the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he slipped to intercept Craig Halket's head toward the goal.
Hosts are happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause trouble for guests
And that's exactly how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free strike, and Livingston invented an opening, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson were assisted by Mengi who hit in the middle of the goal.
By that time, Rangers had most control of the ball, but they faced an unprovoked domestic defense, so the goalman Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the strike.
The legs of the Golman Rangers Allan McGregor have apologised to Scott Pittman, and Lithgov has led a wide-ranging blow from another organised liveston attack.
Long add-ons failed to cross the liveston goal line, and were not awarded two one-star – after Halket's conflict with the replacement player Glen Middleton and one to play by hand.
"Great" by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC in the Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and result of Livingstone.
All up to one was excellent, which they continued to exceed expectations on that entry path.
Their style of games and staff barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but the big credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the head of an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to have a premonition during the whole game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set a good game under Gerrard.
They couldn't get the ball to the end, just once they opened a hole in the home team, and that's their own call to market for Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan awaited with mixed feelings in Koeln
On Saturday (September 29th) everything was a lot of smiles under the bright sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met after breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan Germany – whose goal is to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They were divided into opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of press and access to Turkey's EU.
Erdogan then went to Koeln to open up a huge new mosque.
In that city, the largest Turkish population lives outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a large number of presidents who came to see him appeared nearby.
And hundreds of protesters of Erdogan's opponents – a large number of Kurdas – raised their voices in condemning Erdogan's policy and the decisions of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Conflict demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor some German Turks celebrate as heroes, and others attack as autocrats.
Road crash in Deptford: a biker died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Beswod and Evelyn Street, on the road with dense traffic in Deptford in the southeast of the city about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man passed on the spot.
The crash took place several months after the death of another biker after the crash and the flight of the driver from an accident site on the Chiders Street, about a mile and a half of the Saturday accident site.
City police have reported that police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his closest relative.
Because of the accident, roads are closed and bus traffic is redirected, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in unrest
The prison authorities have reported that six police officers have been injured in a man's prison in prison of a closed type.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
The special "Tornado" units were brought in to reduce the disturbances that include eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the face are provided with help because of minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: “The prison staff has been specially trained to deal with an incident during the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received help because of the injury.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that everyone responsible will be handed over to the police and that we can spend more time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, intervention police were invited to prison to resolve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with bivalve molluscs (possible benefit for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression hit Arizona, but there is a likelihood that it will happen just the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa with the rest of her power goes through the Southwest of the Desert and poses a threat to the stormy floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings about the stormy Monday and Tuesday floods in the West Arizona area, through south and east Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday with the rain and cross right through it on Tuesday.
In his tweet, the National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix reported that “only ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have brought tropical storms or depression about 320 miles [320 km] from Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre provides 50 to 100 mm of fence, with isolated quantities up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwest, including Stinjak and the Great Basin, there is a probability of a range of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total quantities up to 100 mm.
For those beyond the danger of the devastating floods of Rosa, it could come as a rescue because the region was hit by drought.
Although flooding is a major danger, some of these crops could be useful because in the south-west the current government of drought.
"According to the American drought map, less than 40 percent of Arizona was hit by at least extreme drought, another highest category," weather.com said
The journey of the hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moved north at 20 km per hour.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific, so it weakened you.
Therefore, it is expected that Monday afternoon or evening the coast of Mexico will be approached by a tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant danger to the emergence of the flood.
"The total volume of fields expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonore is 75 to 150 mm, which can be up to 250 mm", weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and south Utah by Tuesday late in the evening.
"The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is very strong rains on the peninsula of Baja California, on the north-south of Sonor and in the American Desert West," they reported from the National Hurricane Centre.
You are expected to be caused by the life of dangerous storms and storms of mud in the deserts and cliffs on the mountain plains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton was found injured teenager.
He's taken to the hospital and he's stable.
The Avon and Somerseta police department reported that 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
The police officers called for everyone who had a recording of the events.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh has suffered the evil and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Voice to judge Kavanaugha is a vote to reject the brutal and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election rally in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanauh testified on Thursday before Congress and resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's charges for sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford witnessed the prosecution she filed.
The president said on Saturday that day "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanagha.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugha's vote is to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, the judge with an unprecedented career in public service," he said to the assembled accessions in West Virginia.
The president touched on the Kavanaugh nominations as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' election in half of the presidential mandate.
"For five weeks we are divided into one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am," he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump stated that the democratic mission was "to create resistance and obstruction".
The Republican Leader's Assistant said to the CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh Nomination Senate is expected to take place on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, and the number continues to rise
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, a large number of them pulled away the huge waves that struck the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pala on Friday, when up to six meters high in the summer waves hit the coast, dragging many of them to death and ruining everything on their way.
Cunami followed after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and they didn't run away immediately," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the Indonesian agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a Jakarta press conference.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, fats, houses, hit everything on the ground with him," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and destroyed bridges and the mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent strikes continued to punish that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) announced that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was equivalent to the two-fold power of nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical location of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh’s words, the number of victims and damage may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donghal and closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications are completely broken and we don't have information from Dongal."
"More than 300,000 people live in this area," says the report of the Red Cross, which adds that staff and volunteers have moved to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," the statement states.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism because of the failure to provide information that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials claim the waves came at a time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of the building panics to warn people down the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes the water wall fell onto the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency could not verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the disappearance of the power that caused the interruption of the communication about Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue action.
According to the authorities, it began to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but food and other necessary supplies were still needed to be evacuated.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed by October.
President Yoko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palou on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has taken more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although World Vision staff from Dongale have successfully arrived in the city of Pala, where employees have settled in the inter-Abulian tents set up in the yard of their office, they have followed the scenes of destruction on the way," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched wheels to help disaster, some have argued that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been unable to arrive in Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply and employment of staff from other countries can only begin if the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'Okay, it's a national disaster' we can receive international aid, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Paul on Friday, friends and families of those still considered to be missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
The boy was rescued from the sewer on Saturday.
On Saturday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days by her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those prisoners at Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagija, were his students.
"In view of the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the paragliding community, whatsApp sent messages to the competitions from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a grey hook instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means that messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while filling the ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole 26.750 US dollars on Friday morning from Brink's employee who filled a ATM at the center of Newport on the Levee, reports the Newport Police Office press.
According to Detective Dennis McCarthy, the car driver emptied the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with new amounts of money.
While he was busy with this, the other man "has come to Brin's employee's back in the race" and stole a bag of money that had to be put in a ATM.
The Witnesses noticed more suspicious people fleeing the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper rename in Ye
Raper Kanye West will change the name in Ye.
In a Saturday post on Twitter that announced this change, he wrote: "Life will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has nickname Y for a while and used it as the title of his eight album published in June.
The change comes in front of his guests at the Saturday Night Live show, which is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
The show's authors said that the show replaced the singer Arian Grande who canceled for "emotional reasons".
Except that it's a shortcut to his current artistic name, West has previously said that this word has religious meaning for him.
"I think that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means "only", in Ye alone – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The single album is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And the former West's collaborator, JAY-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a letter and with a letter written in great words.
Mexican AMLO promised he wouldn't use the army against citizens
A candidate for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military force against citizens while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at the Tlatelolco market promised that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military forces fired during peaceful demonstrations in that market on 2 October 1968 and killed even 300 people at the time the left-wing student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador was committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said that the unemployment and lack of education appeal to young criminal gangs.
US should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount that it invests in research in that area," the investor in the field of artificial intelligence and expert Kai Fu Leee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
This comment followed after various parts of the US government announced plans regarding artificial intelligence, although the US lacks a formal strategy on artificial intelligence in principle.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country by 2030 by the number of AI innovations.
"A double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next great discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"A double increase in investment could double the chance that until next great achievement in the field of artistic intelligence will come to the US," Lee said this week in a conversation with CNBC.
Lee, whose book: "Ai velvet: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order", published this month by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing house, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80s last century at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the best American player in the game Othello, and later he was director of the Microsoft Research Department and president of the Google China border.
Lee praised the previous American government's technological competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that leads academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged the brightest minds from the university to work on researching artificial intelligence over the last few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to stimulate its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think doctors in the field of artistic intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council announced the Plan for the Development of the Art Intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Science Foundation provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations provide financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to include partners from the activities and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced investment in $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, he currently invests more than 100 million US dollars a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, American legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence does not do anything for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change of their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted on Saturday at the referendum on whether they want to change their country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and which has blocked Greece's opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a region called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents its territory's occupation and has put the veto on the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign for boycotting the vote cast doubt as to whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 percent of the referendum needed to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?"
Renamers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that this is the price worth paying to Macedonia, one of the countries that occurred after the collapse of Yugoslavia, has allowed access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of names requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State election authority stated that no irregularities were reported within 13 hours.
However, output was only 16%, compared with 34% during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voicer from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško, joined the referendum on the country's change of name in Strumica on 30 September 2018, opening the way for NATO to join the Union and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of parliament in Skopje set a small stage and staged chairs in front of tents set by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said membership in NATO will bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where unemployment exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "positive" result would be "the confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43% of voters will join the referendum, which is below the necessary response.
The second poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the output must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government's policy since it took over its mandate in May last year.
Look: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero is going through the entire Brighton defense to make a hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England tried Brighton's defense and took the victory to Manchester City with a result of 2 : 0.
Aguero made the victory crazy simply, reaching a hit in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton's defense players and then arrived in the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He went around one of the defendants, and then he beat them a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The first attempt was made by an English attacker to return the ball to Aguere, who put the right-hand ball into the right-hand side of the net and defeated Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot problems," reporters reported Manager Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
"We planned to play which 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he made a hit at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Prime Minister League.
That shot was achieved in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep into Brighton's field during that ball game.
Beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left-hand side.
Sane pushed the ball several times before directing Sterling to the stable.
Attacker Sky Blues put the ball into the net just before he slipped into the car.
Manchester City fights Hoffenheim in the team game League champions on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' progress
Since Nationals players were eliminated from playing, there were not too many reasons to insist on a new start.
But always competitively equipped Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, get to play.
Rockies on Friday night with a 5 : 2 win over the Nationals at least secured the place in wild card play, but still hope to win their first title.
"Although we're playing for nothing, we can at least throw out the atmosphere here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I'd witness to this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still have to publish a Sunday launcher, but they're supposed to be willing to offer Scherzer to play in that case.
Scherzer, who's going to make his 34th start, got warmed up in the space for the throwers on Thursday and played on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington right-hand side this season achieved a score of 18 : 7, average of ERA from 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at the Collection in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of the release of Republican voters to general elections, the president commented on his election as Judge of the Supreme Court.
"All we've done will be on the test in the cold.
It's still five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big – I didn't run, but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “See this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, see that it is happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control; so they want power and control, and we will not give them.
The Democrats say they have a mission "to resist and interfere".
"You've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged, evil, corrupt and false".
He called the democratic senator Diana Feinstein from the Senate Justice Committee by name, which caused the public's loud contempt.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document – it was really a bad body speech, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer imports different opinions.
Does not tolerate the expression of personal opinions
It didn't surprise me when Momentum activists in my local stranger voted to censor me.
Finally, I'm the last in a series of Labour Party representatives who were told not to welcome – and all because we said what was on our mind.
According to my colleague Joan Ryan, they had a similar attitude because they strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby in the censorship proposal.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with previous leadership.
The report on the Nottingham Labour Party's border meeting in the spring of Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as a local representative of the Labour Party's meeting of the General Council on Friday night were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings take place in a different tone, and the promise of a "loving, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since the associates I thought to share similar political views from me began to require drastic change of opinion and adoption of positions I would never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – follow the rumors of offensive words on social networks calling for my opposition, who reject the policy of the centre and advise me not to be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because they're comments that are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of a colleague who faces every day a wave of sexist or racist comments, but they never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me most is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with any proposal for non-reliance or change in the rules of the election, we become an increasingly intrusive party.
They've advised me many times in the last two years to raise my head, not to be so loud and tell me that then everything will be okay."
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, encouraged by the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government, which left my school multi-purpose student, I wanted to provide better public services for those who needed them most – either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I've never been hiding my policy, and I've never been in the last election.
No one within Nottingham East could have been misled about my political positions and areas of conflict with current leadership.
All I would recommend to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country grabs against Brexit that will negatively reflect on households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my election units, whether it's about the Labour Party members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to opposition or political benefit will distract me from acting as I consider it to be in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 Undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have had some impact on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the Tennant's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and they're the only unbeatable of ten teams.
Finally, the top defense and better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"They have tried us at every game so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: "Every honour to Ayra, they took advantage of opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14 minutes that Frazier Climo realized led Ayr, but the yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise the score, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo has increased Ayra's leadership to one-aester before, in the very mid-term, he hit and realized a solo attempt to change the result for Ayr at 17:5 in front of the stand.
But Melrose started well in the second half and tried Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced his advantage to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious accident of Ruaridh Knott, which they carried on the carriages, and when the game went on, Ayr continued a good game by trying Stafford McDowall, who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got the yellow card and Melrose made the additional player pay again, and that unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card to destroy Clima who didn't have a ball; with the line for a penalty blow, MacPherson made a laying behind Ayra in a full swing of passage.
Climo realized how he did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's side player to the fifth attempt of the domestic team.
The Still Game series star is ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, the Still Game series star, appears to be ready for further work in service activities after it has been found to be appointed director of the company of licensed restaurants.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a favorite BBC series with a screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
Two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to show up, and Kiernan seems to plan to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan wants to be involved in "growth restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, who has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will assign her exit to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the seabed with a full-fledged elevator in La Paz.
There's a flag of ocean color on public buildings.
Sea basses from Lake Titicaca to Amazone or krillata: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to bring it back."
All over Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in Chile during the conflict over the 19th century is still alive – as is the demand for the resealing of the Pacific.
While Bolivia is awaiting the judgement of the International Court of Justice expected on 1 October, after a five-year trial, and hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimisticly awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians across the country will look at the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after several decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate on the accession of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Here's Morales, a Bolivian charismatic president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the verdict on Monday.
"We are the result of the return of the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it's not likely that the court will judge for Bolivia and that it would change a little if it did.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands has no authority to assign Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after final hearings means that the case "was not complex," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interest, they may have been delayed for the last four years.
"The question of access to the sea has now adopted Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' wartime rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue in one moment, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative of The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made a decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used a maritime question as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea said it wouldn't be nuclear disarmament if she couldn't trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclearly disarmed if he could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep promises of days during the meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
He commented at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that sanctions have continued due to "lost imagination" and that opposition to the U.S. declaration on the end of the Korean war will not put North on its knees.
Washington is not willing to support the declaration without Pjonggang taking concrete steps to disarm it first.
Kim and U.S. president Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongyang to renounce the arsenals that this country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion magazines reveal that the last line of big ones covered the head on the road to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely protect the sun, do not search further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne on fashion presented a line of naked golem covers for their spring and summer 2019 collection and thrilled lovers of style in Paris's weekly fashion.
Extremely impractical hats this summer took in Instagram, and these designers sent their creations that draw attention to the track.
The example that came up was the invention of Valentino, and it was about a big beige hat decorated with a wide-ranging pattern of feathers that completely "takes" the head of the model.
The other glamorous additions included beads decorated with jewelry, magic hats, and even pineapple, but these additions were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many hairy masks had smooth lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion pieces.
One creation was like a diving suit with a trigger and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow the great fashion phrase – happiness is on your side.
The stylists predict that huge hats could come to the luxury store in your neighborhood.
Huge hats perfectly fit the "La Bomba", broken hat with a wide range of about 60 cm, seen on many famous and famous persons, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult trade mark behind the extremely unpracticing hat that was subjected to social networks on the fashion track sent another great creation – a broken beach bag almost as much as a manequin in the bathing costume she wore.
Rusty orange bag of rafia, decorated with rafia resins and white skin lunch, was an exhibition sample in the summer collection Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 in Paris's week of fashion.
Stylist of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury shops next year. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for big fashion supplements."
John Edward: Language skills the citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding results exams, giving added weight to this unique and common success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, a career they want and make them for the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement that school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired object chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use English only if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the most language evaluations have been carried out by independent school graduates.
A total of 68% of students learning foreign languages received excellent grades.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent score for the Mandarin language, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received the highest possible score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as elective objects are considered as important as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom on employment and skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for the preparation of young people for careers.
Since more and more jobs are looking for language skills, skills are key in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of careers, those who have learned to speak foreign languages in the future will feel the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks more languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives him an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in 2013 involving more than 4,000 adults, 75% of subjects in the United Kingdom do not know the foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-way percentage of subjects, more precisely 15 %.
So investing in language learning is very important for today's children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
Every school in Scotland offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will classify classical, modern languages in their programme, while others will decide on languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools you will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are expert in this area.
Scottish independent schools provide an environment in which children will learn to prepare and arm themselves with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be ignored that today's global business of language knowledge is very important for the future of each country so that it must be reflected in education.
Therefore, the knowledge of modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer the choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will play Lakers' dress for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
The fans will soon be waiting for LeBron James' first performance for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they'll play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told Lakers' official website.
Reporter Laker Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably wouldn't play the whole game.
After training at the beginning of this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in Lakers, which consist of six games.
"In this phase of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump holds a gathering in West Virginia, a channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump launches a campaign with numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned collections that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet given his vote for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose most in Congress after the vote in November.
What time does Trump's gathering in West Virginia begin tonight, and how can you look at it online?
Trump's event in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 19 hours in East Time, tonight, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's collection in West Virginia can be viewed online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment on this week's hearing of the candidates for the trial of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh who have raised controversy over the charges of sexual abuse. The Senate's confirmation decision to wait is a week before the FBI's investigation is completed.
But the primary objective of this series of collections is to help the Republicans gain the advantage of the cold elections.
Therefore, Trump's headquarters for the presidential campaign reports that five collections scheduled for the next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and agreeing because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Most in Congress are so important to the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as we enter the burn campaign," Reuters's anonymous spokesman for Trump's campaign said.
The evening gathering to be held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract accessions from "Ohija and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday the second time in the last month. In that country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, from West Virginia, who's staying in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve the ranking in polls," said Politologist Simon Haedar from the University of West Virginia for Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team left its heart on the field before individual raids on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the couple's landing on Sunday afternoon might be exactly what Ryder Cup was supposed to convert.
The phrase "about happiness turns" is which is especially valuable in sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions such as this.
Who's the lucky bike now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So, I think happiness is on our side right now," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are in favour of four points, while 12 points remain until the end of the game.
Speeth says the Americans got a little wind in his back and encouraged his game in a couple with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after the whole day's game.
Speeth played kill from tea to green and can serve as an example to others.
The fanciful glories became louder when Spieth and Thomas came to two points behind, and everything culminated in the key path that Spieth came to an unsolved result.
After the trip that won the 15 hole game, a similar vengeful storm followed in which hope and belief can be recognized that the Americans can turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
The team's all that's left for players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Speeth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
A strange European couple has a maximum number of points and can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who haven't lost a point on Saturday afternoon, but he also escaped Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nini on Friday morning.
The winning series, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, show that they are just the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the European victory while the sun rises above the Parisian Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about the European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly got Alex Norena and Sergey Garcius who had a great performance in this morning's game of couples.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they could not dig.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals get out of their holes.
It is fascinating to watch the games of couples nearby because you can see the interaction of players in a couple, hear the advice that they give and those they don't give, as well as study a strategy that can be changed at the moment.
Europeans have so far played better as a team, and in the last day they come in with significant prejudice, but this game in couples has also shown that the US team has the necessary struggle, which some, especially the Stateside, suspected.
Europeans in the last day of Ryder Cup entering with 10 : 6
After Saturday's games in couples in the last day of Ryder Cup, Europeans enter with a significant priority over the United States at 10: 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led by four points of difference to Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn trying to win a trophy that left her in Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in couples achieving a result of 3 : 1.
The American team has shown greater fighting in couples winning two games, but the difference in points has already been great.
To win a trophy team, Jim Furyk needs to collect eight points in 12 single games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debitant from a European team that won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Mollwood", after the sensational weekend, only another couple who won four points in the couple's history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved to the superpowers in the game against Woods and US debtor Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods, who didn't show the best performance in two Saturdays games, made some brilliant moves, but now there are 19 defeats of 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused morning fourballs to get back to the match with partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2&1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans didn't exactly go like a anointed one during a pleasant day in the southeast of Paris.
The triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, so they put a card on top of their American team.
They first defeated Spanish Jon Rahma and Ian Poulter with a result of 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the entire history of Ryder Cup a team that was behind four points managed to get back in a single game, although Fury's team just needed an unsolved result to keep a trophy.
After two days in the back, it seems that their Sunday attack will be hard.
North Korea announced that "no way" for unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday in front of the United Nations that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and that there is no way North Korea will be unilaterally disarmed and renounced nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing station and decided to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"But we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust the United States, we don't have faith in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we're going to unarm ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known complaints of North Korea against Washington's "step-by" approach to denuclearization, which would progressively abolish sanctions in North Korea, his statement was significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pjonggang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current president of the United States and North Korean leaders in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially put an end to the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has pledged Pjonngang to renounce nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls for a reduction of severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that early denuclearization be carried out and increased pressure by sanctions in order to achieve its goal urgently, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just the delusion of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that sanctions continue to increase mistrust."
Ri didn't mention whether there were plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump, which the president of the United Nations spoke of at the beginning of the week.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in held even three meetings in the last five months and added: "If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea, rather than by the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a halt."
Regardless of everything, the tone of speech of Minister Riya differed greatly from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that the goal of the continental United States rockets was inevitable after wicked President Trump called Kim "a man's rocket" on a suicide mission.
The Trump, who threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions had to remain in force until North Korea carried out denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearization and added: "It does not matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pjonngang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of the UN Security Council said Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verified denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio in the UN's main assembly and then said he would visit Pjonngang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said he had made progress, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex that will be achieved if the United States takes "relevant measures".
He added that Kim discovered that these "relevant measures" relate to the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards the stabilisation of his relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course that teaches them how to rest well
The new course at Harvard University allowed all students to sleep well in an effort to fight the growing culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The Academy has found that students in the world's best university often have no idea of the basics of caring about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has come up with a course he considers to be the first of those species in the United States.
He came up with the idea of a course after giving a talk about the effect of depression on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came to me and said, “Why did I find this out just now, in the last year of college?”
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
A course that is held for the first time this year explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Paul Barreira said the University decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The single course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student bedroom where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, tennis and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how a lack of sleep affects success and how important a routine of sleep is.
During the course, students learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus card with interactive icons is displayed that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in all-night learning before the exam still exists, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that the lack of sleep is becoming a major problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and good dream. Sleeping helps also in the fight against obesity because a lack of sleep affects the brain, throws it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler come up with a course after he attended his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all post-graduates to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students include an alarm during sleep, as well as during awakening. They need to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit screens of electronic devices, as well as LED light that can disrupt circular rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Empty eating Gerrard boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's shot broke Steven Gerrard's lack of defense and ended the game with a liveston victory score of 1:0.
The team from Ibrox wanted to win the first victory after the triumph in February and score 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches, so his team is now behind eight points in the Ladbrokes Primership for the leading Hearts.
Menga reached the event seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers seemed to have left without inspiration and didn't seem to equalize the result.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one incident of the difference behind the Hibernian.
There could be new problems for Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence got a head injury when he was thrown out of a distance of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the sides, and so opposed by Ayra to the half-final of Betfred's bath.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same attitude of Livingstone that Hearts last week took a measure and would be thrilled to see his well-informed attitude extinguished every attempt of the opponent.
The Rangers might have had more ball in their possession, but Livingston got more with her.
They had an opportunity for the event two minutes after Menga was first thrown out of the game that Scott Pittman opened the room to go towards the goal of Allan McGregor, however, the twin missed that opportunity.
The deep free hit by Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow could only follow an inaccurate blow to the rear lines.
Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos must have thought that the judge was supposed to bring an asterist to him in 15 minutes after his encounter with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson didn't take Colombia's request.
Rangers in the first half managed to lead only two balls to the goal, but ex-Ibrox's doorman Liam Kelly one blow with the head of Lassane Coulibaly and the pitty blow of Ovie Ejarie didn't represent a big problem.
Although the 34-minute playing of Livingstone slowed down the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers have again failed to use Jacobs' deep ball back.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added a ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his identity and chose Menga for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the strike and replaced Coulibaly Ryan Kent. The replacement had almost had a current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from its line.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors into exactly the same game they enjoyed while Lithgov and Halkett made a long shot at each other.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a broad escape from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for an asterisk because he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson and this time turned his eyes.
Almanah: Geiger's counter inventor
And now follow the page from our Almanah at Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hansa" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, and from this invention he later developed a device known as Geiger's counter.
The main source of science since then, Geiger's numerator has also become the main source of pop culture, for example in the 1950's "Bells of Colorado" film, in which the main roles were apparently by the incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's numerator, but it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms that react to radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans: "Look at this, that's what's heard!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immunological system that as part of treatment it recognises bad cells
The procedure includes removing the immune system cells from the patient and changing them into the laboratory
The cells are treated so that they can "recognise" the protein that is common to many types of cancer and then reinject to the patient
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immunological system to recognise bad cells, ovarian cancer has been withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes removing the cells of the immune system from the patient, changing them into the laboratory to "recognise" the protein called HER2, which is common to many types of cancer and reinjection of the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute of Cancer in the city of Bethesda in the federal state of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung cancer and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to withdrawing the immune system cells from the patient and their "learning" how to identify cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after hosting a Saturday night live show, took part in a discussion about Trump and supported him, wearing a hat with the title "Make America a Big Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was expelled from the study during the Saturday Night Live show after the performance with the interruptions in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced he would run for 2020.
After performing a third song evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat with the title "Let's Make America Big Again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they say to me, "How you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, to worry about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although she wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech on social media was transmitted by the comic book Chris Rock.
It's not known if he was trying to rob the West by publishing Rock.
Also, the West complained to the public that he was being pushed behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They harassed me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
They tortured me!
They said I drowned," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said he would wear his Superman coat because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
Variety's magazine wrote that his comments were at least twice the public's disappointment, and the members of the Saturday Night Live show felt ashamed, while one person said about the magazine: "The whole studio shut up."
West was last called as a replacement for the singer Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Reper Mac Miller passed away a few days earlier.
The West performed the song "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, amazed many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who on Twitter said: "One of the most courageous people: Thank you for making the Mafia."
But the show leader Karen Hunter on Twitter announced that West was simply "his own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his "art") whom I believe is accepting and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying he is now "will be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, who's also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the reper Snoop Dogg, called Snoop Lion, and of course, passed the music legend Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then in an artist previously known as Prince.
Charge for attempting to kill a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported an incident in Ballyhackamore.
The accused should appear before the Constitutional Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
The star of the game of the throne of Kit Harington turned to toxic matrimoniality
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow that is cheap in the HBO's violent medieval fantasy of the throne game.
But a 31-year-old actor turned to a stereotype cat hero, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they need to be strong to gain respect.
In a discussion on The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic matrimoniality in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie of the Presidency's Game Series, admitted that he wanted to "very resolutely" deal with this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where we made a mistake with the husband?" he asked.
"What did we teach men, as they grew up, in relation to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very male figures on the screen, could partly be responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What was born, then, and what was taught?
What does it teach on TV and on the streets, and that's why boys feel they have to have certain drawings of men?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our time — how can we change it?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the boys.'
He also admitted in the interview that he would not record the sequels of the Games of the throne after her late next summer and said that he "ended with battles and horses".
From November, Kit will play in the new performance of True West by Sam Shepard, a story about the film producer and his brother's robbery.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that happened to him during the shooting of the throne game.
"I met my wife by filming that series, which gave me my family and the future life," he discovered.
Rose was in a fantastic series that won the Emmy Award played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
Couple married in June 2018 at the possession of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases of disease
China has announced that 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS has increased.
Health workers say more than 82,000 people are infected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which is a change compared to the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
At a conference in the province of Yunnan, the Chinese health authorities said that a person infected with HIV in this way is almost gone.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The introduction of the HIV virus to sex is a constant problem between the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is a big person.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative values in the country, 70 - 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public staff has provided information about the GOP senators, calling them "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
U.S. representative Maxine Walters said on Saturday that a member of her staff published personal data by three Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles is convinced that they claim to be the "ultra right wing" individuals, as well as websites.
"Liars, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reported allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orina Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after the three senators of Kavanaugh's trial.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the publication of these data belongs to the Waters representative's office, as well as information on the representative's staff member, reported The Hill newspaper.
"These unfounded instructions are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"Member of my staff - whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and false claims - is not responsible for the leaking of those data.
These baseless instructions are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted internet critics, including former White Speaker Aria Fleischer's house.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that Waters has no temper to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do must not be angry.
It can't be too beautiful.
The defendant's motives must not be re-examined.
He must be calm and steady."
It was felt that Fleischer compared the reaction of Barbara Walters to the criticisms that democracy has directed to the judge of Kavanaugh, who was accused of becoming too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes in general elections against Waters, also posted on Twitter.
"That's important if it's true," he wrote.
Watersova stated in her statement that her office had informed "moderate bodies and order bodies" about these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all the actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Again on the Task" – not interesting Rowan Atkinson fights the spy
Now it is already customary in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that in a new display of the action series "Johnny English" whose first follow-up entitled "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to large screens entitled "Johnny English Again riding".
Will our own satire about how worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
The incapacitated Johnny English eyeballs and rubber face again have permission to complicate the situation, while his name speaks more than anything about a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinematography is not in English.
He is of course a deranged secret agent who despite his bizarre claims on the "distributed" glamorous memory of Inspector Clouseau, has a wealth of character, Mr Bean, and a bit of memory of that guy who played one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
His character was also inspired by a passenger and a mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard, which is a mess of chaos.
There's one or two hot moments in this latest film release.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the propeller just hit his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy talent is visible, but humor is perceived to be rather inexplicable and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Impossible" and themselves offer comedy elements.
Humour is perceived as being intended for children, not adults. In my opinion, the deranged stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as those Atkinson's non-gags are embedded in Mr. Bean's character.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is already a general fact.
Hacker entered the most secret British web-network spy and discovered the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, which unfortunately appears to be Kevin Eldon.
It took over a glass of Prime Minister's patience, superpower and warrior's character who was experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he was politically hated: Emma Thompson was trying to prove himself faithful to a character that should represent Theresa May, but she didn't really get the material to do anything.
Intelligence advisers reveal that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English with his head and beard, who is currently employed as director of some retired school, but he is teaching times how to become a secret agent: here there are a couple of hot gays because English teaches rock-style spying.
English quickly brings to government premises for an emergency meeting, where he meets Bough again, his former partner and his eternal victim, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an over-excited submarine commander who plays Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely lost.
And so the two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who are doing everything completely wrong are returning to action and meeting the beautiful fatal wife of Ophelia Bullett, who influenced Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Volt that Jake Lacy plays.
English and Bough start their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous moments: crushed into a barrage-burned French restaurant, the challenge of a huge mess by smuggling into Voltina's luxury yacht, and English challenges the entire anarchy by trying to use hearing aids for virtual reality to find out what the inside of Voltina's house looks like.
Everything has been done as needed for this last sequel, but as much as the film was attractive and distasteful, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a middle achievement.
And as was the case with other movies about Johnny English, I asked myself again if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party rejects to draw up a plan for British people to work four days a week, and will be paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan that British would work for four days a week and were paid for five days' work.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to save past workers from the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and give them an additional day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
The sources indicate that the idea could be "encompassed" into a party economic programme and plans that the country would be inclined to the interests of workers.
The union Congress supports shifting to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said of the newspaper "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but it represents an effort that matches the approach that this party has to balance the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
The Labour Party, however, does not accept this trend as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and the party does not consider it."
The shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour Party conference to break his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take power from the hands of "beautiful directors" and "professor" in municipal companies.
The plans of the office in the shadow also mean that current shareholders in the water industry may not be able to regain their overall role because the Labour Government could make "debts" based on observed irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to involve employees in the company's administrative committees and to create inclusive own funds to give 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugha suspended the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and asked whether the Agency's conclusion could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Ambassador "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether there was a possibility for the FBI to discover something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy felt more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said following the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after these things, and after they were brought forth unto thee, he said, Have ye done this?
He was determined, irrefutable, unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, is like he's stuck in a rock.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and you really should have a strong charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett rejected everything strongly," Graham added thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons she nominated could confirm her claim.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has anything been achieved with regard to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of the stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of advocates hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (except if they were not willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, e-mailing to the world’s leaders, telephone calls or any other meaningful ways of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen, considering that he has 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of awarding people free concert the right way of convincing people to demand a call for action, or just one more case called "clickivism" – where people feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have marked more than 19 million "action" of its accessions that have sought to achieve a number of different objectives.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of over $37 billion that will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that funds have so far been directly affected by almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and operators in the United Kingdom who are committed to "helping children to develop to their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda with the aim of ending malnutrition in this area.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can achieve that social injustice of nutrition becomes only a feature of history," said Tracey Ullman, an ambassador to the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, published at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
As an answer to one of the most common questions on your website, which says, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen answers: "It will be a long and difficult journey . Sometimes we will experience failure.
But we're going to succeed, as well as big moves for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because we're stronger together.
The performances Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawna Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae belong to some of the performances on this year's New York event that will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner weekly says.
Zinke said the Russian commitment in Syria is particularly where it acts at the call of the legitimate government, an excuse for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in this area, as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he says.
But in his view, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and the blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the presence of the host of the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which is represented in the United States as "a voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The Lord's option Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said, and to Russia he said "uses the same trick" in economies dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements are dated at the same time with the intention of Trump's administration to increase exports of its oiled natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia with a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 (North Stream 2) project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "captive" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's opposition to the project was simply driven by economic reasons and that the example of unfair competition is an example.
"I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stand called for Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German Industrial Organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" the possibility of running for the president of 2020," states the Federal Senator of Massachusetts
The federal senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider the candidate seriously" for the president after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she thought she was running for herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman on the head," The Hill said.
"After the 6th of November, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for the president."
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is leading in the wrong direction".
"I'm terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren says: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that they should run for 2020.
According to a study by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, 50 percent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent votes for the potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
The other prominent names of the Democrat discussed in connection with a potential race for the 2020 president are former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palin at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after reporting in September.
He was arrested and accused of family violence that occurred on Monday night
"What goes through my son, what goes through after his return, is comparable to other families that feel the consequences of PTSP and other wounds our soldiers are returning with," said the public at Donald Trump's gathering in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin's arrest called for the general problem he was talking about, and for his son and other war veterans said that "they are returning a little different, returning firmly, returning asking whether there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the army have given for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, in Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman, with disturbing the registration of family violence and possession of an alcoholized weapon, says Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Police Administration of the city of Wasille.
18 federal states and D.C. support the re-examination of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that undermines asylum for victims fleeing gangs or family violence.
Representatives of the 18 federal states and districts submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who challenge politics, NBC News reports.
A lot of the name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions, which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against the federal policy, has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and violent gang members" abused her, but US officials refused her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and family violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has changed the decision of the Immigration Committee in 2014 which allows immigrants who do not have documents and flee from violence in the family to submit a request for asylum.
The State Counsellor of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law stipulates that all asylum claims are settled on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the prosecution, and such a violation violates this principle," the Court's friend's report states.
The lawyers further claimed that the policy that reduces the entry of immigrants harms the US economy, claiming that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force".
Chief State Lawyer Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to stop approving asylum victims fleeing family violence and gang violence in June.
"Assil is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its statement on politics on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems even all the serious problems people face every day around the world.
A desperate rescue effort in Palu as the number of victims doubles in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting harder.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at the evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
‘Emergency assistance for imports of bodies every minute.
The government is depriving clean water."
The residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, reading through floodwaters, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were hooked.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who suffered a break in his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly due to ongoing severe post-disaster stress.
His tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feelings of a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I think I was depressed inside the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "mutilating" through "propaganda ads"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published four long pages of ad in the US daily newspaper that promoted the mutual benefit of US and China's trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of abuse of the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump turned to China Daily's paid addendum in the most sold newspapers in Iowa, Des Moines Register, on Wednesday, after accusing China of wanting to join the American Congress elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to get involved in the American elections marked what US officials in the Reuters statement characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in the escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's revenge at the beginning of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican party, quoted Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, a US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured US workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday issue of the newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad says that China "now doubles this abuse by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find limited voices of opposition on the street in Beijing and you will not see any true reflection of different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were in question.
The Republicans of Kavanaugh have removed voters before the mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are standing with a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and defend him on a number of sexual abuse instructions, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were quite excited, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things can't be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last instigation of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be sufficient to silence the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and will not forget it tomorrow, nor in the cold," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, quoted the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang: "Come cold!", protesting in the hall of the Senate, while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee were preparing to continue with the Kavanagh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say they are already at high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among women in suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony, in which she's detailed statements about the sexual assault by the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's a real mix for the Great Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
"It is not only a vote in the committee or a final vote or whether Kavanaugh has been sent to the savings club, but also how the Republicans have access to it and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of the Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about whom they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more inclined toward him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the truth of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they certainly believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said he thought that Kavanaugh probably lied or definitely during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the claims Ford made, along with at least one more prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Fordova testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court's trial showed her genitals at the party during the Yale study in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company aimed at becoming a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's open Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee was concerned about the intention behind the Inrupt's "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said thinking on the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal network data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact descriptions, bond descriptions, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision is about who can access to which information fully user.
The company calls it "personally strengthening the data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to Chief Executive Director John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a project work contract, as well as the voluntary programmers' communities.
Since this week, development engineers from around the world have been able to build their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a media release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptova "is a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of new networks built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the Institute of Technology of Massachusetts (MIT).
Over the past months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even as the Inrupt is running, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the High Priests of the First World War of the Victorian Cross
Celebrations in honour of the only Anglican Church priest who was distinguished by the Victorian Cross as a fighter in World War I was placed in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received the greatest British military honor.
The monument was discovered by two of his grandsons at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's conquest for which he received this recognition.
According to the London Gazette official's report, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through St. Quentin's channel "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and machinery".
He later rushed into the first row and with "incredulous courage" led the team forward before he ran without any help to the Polish top and cut three out of the military squad.
Lieutenant Vanna killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918. . something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never achieve, and that it is arousing humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed the winery after the parade led by the parade orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honored to participate in paradise" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
The lovers of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead of him they got the Peach Peppu
Imagine this, you stay awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches so that you will eventually be unable to track the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in Britain live on channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, viewers in Britain remained in shock when the transfer ended Prastic Peppa.
Many were not impressed after just staying awake until the early hours of the morning because of the fight.
A fan of a stopover on Twitter described it as "a kind of sick joke".
"According to the state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to transfer it to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Jupi, "Prakčić Peppa."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he would align his schedules to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I consider reprisals, I think we can probably fix something," Coker said.
"But the transmission is there at six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until we have Sunday, when they already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many scriptures that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't.
I can promise you next time it won't come.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six what we're doing, and we're trying to give more to our fans, but we're over-exposed.
It's about unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to be successful.
A twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school, he was not aware that "not everyone is like me."
In his statement on Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also said his victory in the Olympics was less important since he became a father.
The regular director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months to rest because of the disease.
Appearing as a waste in Laverna's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" in relation to others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, your feelings of inferiority and diversity in relation to others have been the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove he was "someone and something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal became a prominent person who advocates LGBT persons and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Game in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The triple world champion said he was surprised that he fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an ostracist, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said the difference in years was never a problem for him.
"When you're so young, you're going through so much." He turned to his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was hard to find someone of the same age and to experience similar climbs and falls.
In June they became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about 'getting a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie's my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London in 2012.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand while he was breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life to jump in front of the home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration to choose the first song of the "Proud" singer Heather Small , who was huddled in it during the preparations for the Olympic Games and which she always gets stuck in .
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape at the Ryder Cup Club on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to recover completely in order to avoid an unpleasant shift.
Mickelsson, who played this two-year game on record 12 times, sent Captain Jim Fury to the club in Saturday's games with four balls and fours.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as it was often for the United States, a four-fold winner spent the day in cheering and distributing his games at the gym hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National field, where the long nervous area routinely punishes inaccurate strikes.
And if I'm not scary enough, Mikkelson's 9th game on Sunday is faced with the British Open Frances Molinary's exact champion, who won every four matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Fury said he had confidence in his man more than that and couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, drowned me behind his back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"There's a lot of confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't think I was playing two games.
I figured there'd be more, but that's how it turned out and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
That could mark the end of his career in Ryder's shop, which has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Fury said his presence brought certain immaterial values on the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the individual Ryder Cup matches can be easily turned into an uncomfortable race.
Danak won the 1997 Valderram game, where the team of Captain Sevea Ballesterosa had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a significant difference of 141⁄2 1⁄2 1⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a slight difference," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team, who won the 5th score on Friday and yesterday led the 10th score on the Le Golf National field.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll play with full power tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do everything you can.
Nothing's over until there's a floor on the panel.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we're quite aware who's standing against us, the biggest players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players in the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run into this.
Tomorrow's better to face a different beast.
Tomorrow are the main individual performances, and that's something different.
It's great to play with a partner when it's all right, but when you're there as an individual, at the end of your golfer's ability exam.
It's a message you have to deliver to the players, and she's got to give the best of herself tomorrow.
Now leave your player because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the other side, Jim Fury, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with the players, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Fury himself was on both sides of those big rounds last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe carried out "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning, like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that vest goes in a certain direction, he puts great pressure on the middle swords.
According to that, we organized our position and set up boys as if we were, you know, trying to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned a mission to try to prevent a counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahma, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I've decided that this group of boys is going in this order because I think it's covering everything," Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
German new warship reset to wait
The latest German naval frigate was to be released in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war, but will not be ready until at least next year due to incorrect systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, a leading ship of completely new baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports the Die Zeit list by referring to the military speaker.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships, which the Navy ordered in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
As well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures, will have a strong top, a series of anti-fraud and anti-fraud missiles.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods ↔ should be possible to distribute the latest fryings during the period up to two years without returning to the port of birth.
The constant delay, however, means that the most recent warships, which are said to enable Germany to display power abroad, will become obsolete until the time of entry into service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate reached all the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Bohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media have quoted a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make the warship useless if it was sent to the combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will run a crew of about 120 sailors less than on the older Bremen fleets.
It also showed that the ship is a dramatic burden that reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ of 7,000 tonnes is twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the cost of the whole project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems resulting from the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that sailors actually "stand up ships capable of deployment".
The officer said that the problem increased over time, because the old ships were out of fuel, and there were no replacement vessels.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates can join the Navy.
The National Foundation listens to the secret life of bats
The aim of the new research carried out at the property in Scotland is to find out how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in managing future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Scottish Foundation (NTS) will follow the usual and humid bats, as well as brown long and river bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile checks using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's voting and what kind it does.
Then a map of the habitat and the report will be drawn to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes the results will discover which areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have fallen significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and work on an arrangement that affects shelters and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can mussels and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by cats of pets.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles along the way of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, bats take very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland on the property of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats living in Scotland live.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a huge space for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good places.
However, there is much more that we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other facilities will help us to better understand what they need for progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting work on maintenance inside the building, as the unintentional destruction of one lay may kill up to 400 women and young people, thereby probably destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and unlawfully killed, tortured or harassed or destroyed their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Association for the Protection of the Bats, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply don't know how their population is moving forward."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers are preparing to sue German newspapers
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges against him as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who has published these charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape by the American on behalf of Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375 000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the indictment, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says a four-fold gold ball winner in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the footballer with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the statements they called "an unacceptable report on the doubts in the area of privacy," Reuters writes.
Lawyer Christian Schhertz said the football player would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
It states that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel apartment and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, reportedly returned to the football room, where he reportedly raped her, are listed in documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was the "good guy" who failed that "one percent".
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that he was agreed upon.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an overseas agreement because she was "fearing revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-four-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve to make a transfer worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will "permanently repent" for losing car manufacturers
The UK will "suffer forever" if after Brexit the world's car leader loses his status, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" because Toyota UK told the BBC that, in the event that Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting on the borders in Brexit's case could lead to loss of jobs without an agreement.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis, which produce the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My position is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March without an agreement, we will experience the production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyotin in Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears about leaving the EU without an agreement due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Miniature factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturer relate to the risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without an agreement reached.
Toyota's production line works according to the principle "just in time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars operating by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it could come to an end on the border for which the industry says it could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota in her factory in Derbyshire couldn't keep more supplies than they needed for one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the "Checkers" plan that offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "accalibrated precisely to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will enable, as I say, not only to maintain the present success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4 today's programme.
"The evidence not only toyote, but also other manufacturers show that we must be absolutely able to continue this very successful supply chain."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that long-term vision, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a member of the United States union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, after you leave, you never come back again.”
The government spokesman says: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Lawyer Rod Rosenstein could "be delayed for another week" as the fight against the candidate for the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugha continued, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the relationship between Trump's associates and Russia, and any interference by the president.
The question is whether Trump will fire the deputy state attorney, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, but for months he's been disarming his tapes in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wired to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of an announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid interrupting the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women charged with sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a lot of the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date could be this week; it could be postponed for another week, taking into account everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some reporters would object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of a press conference is not a consequence of the "theatrical behaviour" of television reporters, although he said, "I will not oppose the facts to be confused."
Then she pointed out that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organizes more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she said without giving evidence: "We analyzed the figures."
A brief conversation will continue, Sanders said, but "If journalists have a direct opportunity to ask the US president, it is far better than talking to me.
We've been doing this a lot, and you've seen it in the last few weeks, and that's exactly what you can talk to the president of the United States will change the short speech to reporters."
Trump regularly gives answers to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Lonely press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled press.
Ministry of Health writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed a letter to EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, has sent a letter about six months before the withdrawal of the UK withdraws from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already pledged to support the costs of applying for EU citizens living in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued over the summer, moving towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
But the United Kingdom government also reinforces preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would now like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, as well as wider, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie subjected to an emergency operation after a head injury
The line player of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in the Saturday defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores club, with a result of 31 1⁄2, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Master Coach Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the accident happened immediately before the half-life.
"He came to the playground line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the carriers and sent it to further search.
State University Representative Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was no "type/range of injury" detail and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student from two years of gaming internship, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five rounds before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
That step will neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Risnica expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's effort to attract young voters to promises to ensure more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
Increased taxes will be paid by individuals and companies not paying taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to combat homeless people.
The additional fee Õ which is charged to the current fee, including the increase which was introduced two years ago to other houses and properties purchased for the purposes of the issue Õ may also be up to three per cent.
This move is expected to raise 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London buy residents who do not have a home in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country have become "the cities of spirits" especially in the main city because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help a larger number of young people come to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking up but not using the country, and urged Ms. May to give up the quota on affordable properties in order to correct the "hate over the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of nothing caused by the investment.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the renewal of the British dream that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means repairing our housing market failure.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it can't be right that individuals who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-born companies, can easily buy homes as well as valuable British people.
The dream of home possession has become too far away for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" was one day to become Scotland's manager.
Scotland (42) enjoys the challenge of reinvigorating the northeast club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than leading.
This summer, he moved to the Light Stadium after last season again led St. Mirren to the Scottish Football Championship.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told the BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But this opportunity could still be achieved only if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland's office include Dick Moyes, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roy Keane, Gus Poyeta and Paul Di Cania.
Former Chief Allo Athletic says he wasn't afraid because he inherited so famous names in such a big club, after he previously declined calls to Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will be measured by whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably think of myself as successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross completed only the third year of his administrative career, after the period during which he was the assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of falling to the winner's title next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real intersection," recalled the acquisition of Alloe.
"I really believed that management was what was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I managed well, worked hard and enjoyed pretty successful times.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and stress, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for the paint is at 17:30 on Saturday, as research shows
The summer heat wave increased revenue to British pubs who were struggling with the finances, but increased pressure on the launch of the restaurant.
The data show that pubs and bars have increased income in July by 2.7 per cent, but revenues in restaurants have decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the business consultation of the Office of the Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the nice time and participation of England at the World Championship that lasted longer than expected was that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when the revenues of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the fact that the restaurants were now more hit.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the revenues of the restaurants in June just got worse in July.
Pubbles and bars where drinks are mainly served have achieved much greater gains under equal conditions compared to losses suffered by restaurants.
The pubs where food is mainly served also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed beer and bar sales, drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales increased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst of the RSM for rest and hospitality, said: "These results are continuing the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the foreign market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with difficulties, although sales drop of 4.8 per cent at annual level will be particularly ill due to constant cost pressures.
Long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for local leaders serving food, and time will show if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the necessary supplies."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing of growth in trade marks.
The system for monitoring sales in the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of 47 operational groups, with total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value is established.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks they hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
The 20 000 high school students survey showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
The news reinforced the fear of publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account showing their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high-school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts on the website for sharing photos.
The news reinforced the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use the cleared "main" account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
One mother who visited her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who encouraged me with the words "violate me".
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which they admit to own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual administrative body meeting.
Doyle is the most outstanding Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who take the sport to take advantage of her wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will have great benefits by making him a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American, who won a 200-400-metre race at games in 1996 in Atlanta, of his four Olympic gold total, and now a regular BBC expert, after a passing ischemic attack, could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only take time to show me if I would recover.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again and today to practice agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
Online shared opinions on advertising for a publisher comparing mothers with cows
A company for the production of publishers with its advertising that mothers who breast-feed their children compare to cows that the husband raised shared views on the Internet.
In order to mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be "the first silent publisher in the world", Elvie for Consumer Technology announced an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that a new publisher gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a state full of shadows and cows with music whose text reads: "Yes, I am married to myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't yours, it's my breasts."
Then follow the line: “Expunge, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, husband your ladies.”
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed viewer reactions, and many say it lights up the "horrible" dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children steal a few days after birth," one person wrote.
The publisher Elvie discreetly fits in the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “Expertably traumatic for the mother and the child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a traitor to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added: "Fullly wireless advertising."
Others defended advertising, with one woman admitting that her song was "excellent".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I could still get one, I'd buy one.
The delivery of milk made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it was.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This entertainment advertisement is directed at mothers who issue milk (often at their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like ‘requirements’.
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they all danced with discreet traitors located in the bra.
The concept of campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie is, however, completely silent, no wire or pipe and discreetly fits into the breast of the breast, allowing women to move freely, holding their babies, and even going out during the delivery.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother’s agency, commented: “Elvie’s publisher is so revolutionary a product that it deserves brave and challenging launch.
Making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to focus on publishing and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This is not the first time that traitor Elvie has reached the headlines.
During London’s weekly fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children migrants quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children held by migrants increased, although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration made it difficult to accommodate children under the care of the sponsor.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors were immigrants themselves without documents and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to remain in the country by stepping up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to print their fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before the congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsoring minors without escorting.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested earlier were not recorded in criminal records.
"Almost 80% of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the country's home are illegal, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to search for those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelter workers, with a view to speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was previously standard.
Many will appear through a videoconferencing call, not personally, so that they can file their case before the immigration court to obtain legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for help will be deported quickly.
According to workers in shelter and reports that have emerged from the last few months, the longer children remain in custody, it is more likely that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent disappearances or attempts to escape.
Protesters said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, it is very likely that signs of the child being tortured will be predicted.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem has also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Moulem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said that the forces were against the law on the Syrian soil, in the face of the fight against terrorism, and that they would "consistently comply with it and act".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," the assembly said.
Moualem insisted that "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus will continue "fighting in this world until all Syrian territories are cleared" by terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were met and he accused "some Western countries" of "widening irrational fears" which encouraged refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major rebel Idlib rebellion created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement prevented a massive Syrian attack with Russia's support for the province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards the jihadist, including Nusra front fighters related to Al-Qaeda, "to be eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to form a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Moualem set up conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of confidence should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interfering.
Why Trump will win second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump should win again in the 2020 elections unless, what many liberal observers are likely to hope for, the objection and scandal will soon end his presidency.
What would no doubt be "the most dramatic final presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the viewer's murder right now.
Since 2014, visibility in the hit-and-run period has doubled by more than 1.05 million at CNN and has almost tripled by 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million visitors in the weather, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast exceeded the visibility of even 3.5 million viewers for the evenings of the main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a producer of ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama, about a government secretary who becomes the president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he laughs at me," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on the expulsion of the origins of Roe's proceedings against Wade, can immigrant families be reunited as well as the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, you exceed the level of the informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his book Fair, about Paul Manafort's jacket of leather worth $15,000 (“a clothing item full of behaviour”, writes Washington Post) and the implications of the intimate descriptions, this, Mr. Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, Super Maria will never look with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that I feed you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Zalagaonica show, about the rotating acting position and the daily complications of Trump's show (a fight with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fless this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauaija, it was sunny at 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watching MSNBC and recorded CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung about the end.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money outside goes to the most uncertain mid-term election for Congress
It is not surprising that 17th-century Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reconstruction of the congressional districts that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently rebuilt district of Pittsburgh's county stands out as a Democrat, Connor Lamba, who won a place in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb competes against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th county of Pennsylvania, who is very much intertwined with the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old circuits were continuously reduced in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign financing fight between the main party fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after his victory in a wide-ranging special March election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congression.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point prejudice.
Political analysts have given little priority to democracies.
The U.S. is right if El Salvador should be punished for providing support to China and then withdrawing
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance to Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to invite US diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Speaker Heather Nauert.
However, the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, who received estimated US$ 140 million in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted significant restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progressing in preventing migrants from moving to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus actually interrupted any review of the punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attachs to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
Speaker of the White House, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the particulars of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates subject to anonymity.
Their report confirmed an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The following may be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible injustice of Trump's judiciary, which is now a very significant public evidence available.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is prepared to stand before the voters again, and maybe in the end and with the jury of his levels.
There is a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trum's inevitable fall is neither those in Europe like him.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to execute a state strike against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakian in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the casualties that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflation, and the unmistakable march of democracy is accelerated or later.
The Americans are now facing a few of these points of inflation.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires a deputy state attorney, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since these papers reported that last year he secretly proposed filming the president and assumed his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if a recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it has been confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible charges for sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress, which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my e-mail home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for shabby on that table with a cuckoo cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapida from Vienna
The Rangers on Thursday are host to Rapida from Vienna, knowing that they will win over the Austrians, after an impressive rhyme in Spain against Villarrela at the beginning of this month, to put themselves in a strong position to qualify from the Group of the G European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2nd season with Villarrela, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a jumpboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villareal was a good opponent," said a 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we pulled out a point.
Maybe we could end up stealing the game, but, generally viewed, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
There's another big European night Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now it's a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that research participants had a clear preconceived view of what they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the nationwide students said they talked to their husbands about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance Nationwide.
Here's where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to take care, because your choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care funding can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have money.
Manage your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Engage healthcare professionals to identify a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also consider giving full authority to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not able.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and that he is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about the finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Hold that plan by the hand."
A man shot several times from an Ilfracombe air rifle
A man was shot several times by an air gun while he was coming home after the night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, officials reported, and the number of dead is expected to increase.
Since the communications were interrupted, relief officials could not obtain any information from the province of Dongale, a region north of Palu, which is close to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Palu and Donghal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
She reached a county extending over 300 km north of the island of Sulawesia.
The county, the administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Paul and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
Tsunami also struck West Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: Following severe earthquakes, it hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the Sumatre coast.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the South Coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died following the fall of the building.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin (29), from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of family violence, interference with family violence and arrest rejection, a report published Saturday by the Alaskan state police officer said.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and is detained on an unsecured $500 bond, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where the issue of explanation of guilt was explained "innocent, of course", the network reported.
The fuel is charged for three Class A violations, which means it could be in prison for up to a year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B violation, which is punishable by one day's prison and a fine of $200.
It's not the first time they've been tried against Palina.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Justice of the Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with family violence, a violation of the registration of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholized state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin criticised the veteran groups in 2016 after connecting her son's violent behaviour to PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused the tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Networks for electricity and communications are broken, and in the next few days there is expected to be an increase in the number of dead.
The earthquake struck the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital city of Indonesia Jakarte.
On social networks, video recordings show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people were killed -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to rent a shop Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he cut down pedestrians and bikers who found himself on his way to October
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov's "intended" killed eight victims and "intended" caused a serious physical injury, according to the announcement of the intention to seek a death penalty, which was suffered in the South New York County.
Both of these points lead to any death penalty, in accordance with the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipova's federal grand jury struck a 22-point charge involving eight counts of murder and extermination, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and preconceived," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "a cruel, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca", the announcement of the intention states.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York County last prosecuted the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last committed in a New York federal case in 1953, when couples Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to a conspiracy to espionage the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police reported.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to carry out an attack, it was reported in the indictment.
He also asked the police to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
It turns out he's not guilty of 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, rather than accepting the confession of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release to liberty, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death penalty.

Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the national army" during a demonstration at the Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "sympathize pressure" Eurosceptics since one of the Members of parliament Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be gone" until now that Mr. Farage was secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in the reconciliation of their deeply divided lines highlights the Tureans' retreat to join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his compromise plan "Checkers" in the middle of the Brexit, the EU and the rest of the attack.
The Allies insisted that she would continue with efforts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and labs to choose between its package and "caosa".
Mr. Bone said on a joint campaign "Leave Means Leave" in Solihul that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have received the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were the chief, we would have been out by now," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Addressing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our own laws into our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed the opinion and that they want to remain is completely incorrect."
The Conservative and Brexitian, Andrea Jenkyns, was also at the scene, speaking to reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
Plan Chequers is not popular in the public, the opposition won't vote for him, is not popular in our stranger and among our activists who were actually those who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a strong message, Mrs May added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the gathered that politicians must be forced to "sigh pressure" if they are going to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'it won't pass'."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, on the edge of Brexit’s edition, to feel pressure.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has given us a victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the docked remains marched through Birmingham before they held a two-way assembly in the city center.
The crowd of activists was waving the "Torians against Brexit" transparent after the group was launched this weekend.
Laborist Lord Adonis complained to the conservatives about the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the unmistakable state of the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "consider seriously" to run for the president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he "will seriously consider candidates for president" after his election in November.
Boston Globe reports that a democratic woman from Massachusetts was talking about her future on Saturday at a direct association with citizens in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a scholarship in November 2016 against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts.
It's been in the middle of speculation for a while now so that you can confront Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took over duty.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman on the forehead."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in a shooting with a fatal result of a basketball player at the State University in Louisiana (LSU) Waydea Sims, which took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police published information on the arrest of Ditheon Simpson (20), 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
They published a murder video on Friday, looking for help in identifying a man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the University of Southern Campus.
"Wayde Sims got his head shot wound and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wade got involved to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at a crime scene and owned a gun and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the first 10 positions last season and on average 17.4 minutes and achieved 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the order assures him of victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a great role in the race".
From the initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and calling on Vettel to attack his team member.
Vettel first went to the boxing and left Hamilton to start trading, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of the wheel on the wheel which caused the driver Ferrari to trouble leaving the free interior in danger of delay after a double move in defense of the third.
Max Verstappen left last row and was the seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race while trusting his tires to reach a quick finish and beat Kimie Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally got into a box in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he's the real gentleman that let me pass.
Tim did a really great job to achieve a training finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad speech of the body.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday for insisting that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not give a direct attention to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "bad and bad and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry, ugly and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information in the public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leave the information?
Remember her answer... did you leave the document to the public - 'aaa, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent in July a letter detailing Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it was announced earlier in September - but Feinstein demanded that the information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, her story I didn't let in the public," Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret, which she was looking for."
However, her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who, at the meeting on Saturday night, commented: “Let me tell you something: it was a very bad speech by the body.
Maybe it's not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Continuing his defense of candidates for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that democracy use these accusations for its own purposes.
"They are determined to return power at any price.
You see the evil, the greed, they don't care who's going to hurt, who they have to run to get to power and control," said the president, Mediaite conveys.

Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the aircraft escape the quake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while securing safe flights of hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many are watering themselves like disappearing after the great earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused the tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to strike the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the control tower of Mutiara Airport, Sis Al Jufri, which swooped heavily.
It remained to ensure the safe flight of the Batik Air aircraft on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going down.
He passed away later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirat, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our heart breaks because of it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of dead could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says a limited approach to the cities of Dongali, Sigia and Boutong.
"It is believed that the number of dead is still increasing, as many bodies are still under the ruins, and many could not even be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency, said.
The waves that reached a height of up to six meters broke Paul into which a mass funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "She drove emergency aid every minute to import bodies.
The government is scaring clean water.
They're stealing small stores everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Yoko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country's army: "Please all of you work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A drop of aircraft in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man runs as missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
An aircraft company that owns an aircraft that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is being operated as missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the aircraft that he was tones.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon, I cannot follow one of the passengers.
The airline reported working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find the person concerned.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for additional information on a passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk's airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday, and that everyone was in stable condition.
Which led to a fall and the exact outcome of the events remained unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some of the eyewitnesses thought the plane was missing the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to penetrate through the water that had cut them to the point of exit in the event of the danger of the plane that was tones.
He said the guards panicked and yelled, and he suffered less head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that mariners working near the port repair site also helped rescue using a boat to take people to the ground before the aircraft sank in about 30 metres of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that in the accidents of aircraft carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades 111 people were killed, but none of them included Air Niugini.
An analyst exhibits a time review of the night the woman is burned alive
The prosecution ended the case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Justice Department, witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to agree to a puzzle about the move of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location data from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers at night when she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambersin at the time when he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "had agreed, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, phone calls and contact details.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's a enlightened hip-hop?

The "The High Breed" singing group in Bristol claims that hip-hop music has been removed from its beginnings by political messages and by looking at social issues.
They want to return to their roots and hip-hop again to make popular.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are born again in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York Nanny sues a couple for quitting after a "racial" message
The New York nanny sues a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from a mother called "one more black".
Couples deny that they are racists, comparing the charge with "exulsion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out at her first working day in 2016 that she was the new baby of her children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
"NOEEE ANOTHER CERNKINE," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her wife.
However, instead of sending her to her wife, Mrs. Maurice sent her twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "unsightly" situation, and she fired Ms. Maurice, because she claims, what their ex-nanny, who was African-American, had done badly, and that instead of her, she was expecting the Philippines, she was carrying the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got a paycheck for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice sues a couple for a resignation fee and seeks compensation of $350 per day for a period of six months for which she was originally hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
Couples returned to claims that they were racists, saying that ending Mauritian's employment was reasonable to do, because of the fear that she would be unable to trust her later because of the insult.
"My wife didn't mean what she texted her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"Would you trust your children to whom you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife had only two months of maternity leave after she was born and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"You'll sue someone who's in a situation like this
"That's not very nice," the investment bank added.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned couples on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not share with the bears who spoke, is revealed in a new letter.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun what we know now about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC recorder before a little drunk bear inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic when his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as "very important family member", she added that her father was silent proud of his final success.
"He was quite these men and he wasn't a praiser," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was experienced as a person reaching his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is actually your work.
I think Paddington's success was watching it that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington alone."
My daughter was dying and we had to forgive each other on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nica, where doctors were vainly trying to save her life.
"Now he regularly called to say it's really bad and to believe that he won't get away," said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I must forgive her.
What I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart working slowly lost effect and left her body system.
She died just before she boarded, and then everything went off.
I just had to sit down and wait knowing what's going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who was already in mourning at the time of the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were not aware of the trials she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and my tears all the time slipped down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong feeling of sympathy for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Messages of a woman in mourning on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on the big bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a cook with a contagious smile waiting for a bright career.
"Everyone remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in "a really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly worry that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of cards “how people would know there was someone you could go and talk to, even if she was a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davies' long friend, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the bottom of Christmas when the kids opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eye, he didn't want anything else."
She said that his death was a major trauma, but that they had to overcome it: “It all leaves a big hole in the family.
He's throwing us away.
But we will continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs about the end while the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought we might be able to enter a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for a time- and extensive limited investigation," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding how he feared that the committee would be "distorted" in the midst of the rooted sideblock.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their trouble was driven by a choice of time.
The mid-term elections arrive in just five weeks, November 6th, if, as expected, the Republicans do not pass well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly summons senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
He will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to break his decision-making vote and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of escapes from North Korea 'fall' under the direction of Kim
The number of escapes from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Calling for information from the United South Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said last year there were 1127 escapes in comparison with 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors are more stringent controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
A large majority of the North escapes eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China is considered to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South that are still technically at war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang at talks that focused on ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work to free the Korean half-arms from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions for not making any progress ever since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it will not be taken into account that we are first armed under such circumstances," said Mr. Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "historic", says he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the opposition, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and said he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not have thought that if she had ever acted like that, they would have been called 'historical'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally exposed the claim that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost yelling and suffocating while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "gross and coordinated overthrow" that organised liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court because he showed prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualificating himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
On the question of whether he will try to revoke Kavanaugh if it is confirmed, and if democracy gets the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi is dead.
"I'll tell the next thing if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but not in the court he's in now," said Pelosios.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democratic woman, she was concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanauchov against the Act on Access to Care or the Law on the Voyage of the Roe v. Wade procedure, since she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh turned around questions about whether he was going to reconsider some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful'," said Pelosi.
Women have to deal with it.
Reasonable criticism, anger that has been gathering for months and years, can't get rid of all of this without pay.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was a former executive director and who said that she too was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started to cry, the person who spoke to her next said: ‘ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as an exit for anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in the office where the men dominated, is how I was, once I cried because of unresolved anger, an older woman who was a cold manager who I was always a little scared to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-court affair on the Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for the president.
"It wasn't a well-designed decision," she told me through the laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly did not need another one.
Someone called them "Snow and seven ducks."
Since the campaign had already slowed down, she was lagging behind in fundraising, and she said she wouldn't be in the race if she didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 to men, gave her just $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
While she was saying that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it difficult to collect money and target voters instead of delegates, and angry about sexism to shake her throat.
"You'd think I'd experienced a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's media reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone monument.
"She cried."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of a trade war between the US and China has been louder and, while the battle is far from the end, the gap between the countries may be of the benefit of Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, first issued a warning earlier this year, reversing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week has emerged with new customs duties affecting products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), actually relieving half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has returned in some way each time, and recently customs from five to ten percent have been imposed on US$60 billion.
China has promised that the US will respond to the impact, and the second largest world economy will certainly not be delivered soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by failing to demand, but public obedience to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the American trade war can provide positive support for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the launch of economic stroking in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a research associate for strategic thought that focused on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country that has destroyed a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the field is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the area of destroyed terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed towards their daily life and existence have been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebellion.

Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, winning the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has regained the crown while Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points that they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured during almost the entire tournament, sent a pair of 3 to the 16th hole in the water at the first blow, leaving the French Molinary sword.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been brilliant in all rounds and has become one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament started this format.
The American Jordan Spieth expelled Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest-ranked European team player, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of English Ian Poulter who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder buys, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became European with the most winning tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't stop tears today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the cup again.
I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, full of emotion after a European victory.
He's handing over his nephew John Rama, who won a legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, with a result of 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in winning over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in Ryder Cup.
Extraordinary statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 headlines, and is right behind Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf during the entire tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we have provided resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll get over it, I'll work with PGA America and our Board of Ryder Cup, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We're on top."
