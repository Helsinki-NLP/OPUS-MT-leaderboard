The members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they “seem to be like fools ”
Part of the members of the Assembly are stoned by their proposal to change their name to "CPU" (member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the "Parliament of Wells".
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be a cause for laughter.
One of the labyrinths has said that his group is concerned that the new name is "brought with Tup and Wdlub."
For readers outside Wells: In Wellsky this is definitely offensive.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
The representative of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group "has not been persuaded" to change the name, but notes that the new name CWP (MWP) has a certain verbal opportunity with "mopet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is similar to the English Yorkshire reference of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the draft bill to change its name, made the following statement: "It is understood that the final decision for all descriptive names, with which the members of the Assembly are called, will belong to the members themselves".
The Wells government law of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling the Parliament of Wells.
As far as the duties of its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "Member of Parliament of Wells, briefly "CPU", but the "CPU" option has received the greatest support after a public inquiry.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft bill for change within a few weeks.
The reforming bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, i.e. rules on the disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the Commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they reach the draft law.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which has an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to the Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name of the country, has stated that you will not vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name of the country is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut in the background of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today both are missing."
Adams said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"Today people are socializing in different ways," he adds.
"The barons are no longer the quarter-days where everyone gathers regularly."
As to the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same situation".
The man adds that the churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people live who don't help survive the rest of the neighborhood sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy houses in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them."
Both churches were built by white pastures before Harlem became a quarter of the Blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin decades later.
The initial White Methodist Passage took place in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became owned by black neighborhoods.
"St. Martin" was a poet by the black Christians under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who organized the fight against the traders on the 125th street, which is the main market street in Harlem, since they did not want to hire black people.
In 1939, the building suffered severe defeats in the fire, but Father Johnson's heroes made a plan for her restoration, where the bells were ordered.
David Johnson, father Johnson's son, and St. Martin's heir, proudly calls them "the poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world, which was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriuder says that St. Martin's has not been replaced.
What has played in St. Martin over the past few weeks has been a complicated story, drawn from architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church, and others from the Episcopal parish.
From the Vestary – which is the postage management body consisting of world leaders – they wrote to the Eparchy in July, expressing their concern that the Eparhi “would be inclined to transfer the costs of the Vestary,” although he did not have a role in hiring the architects and performers sent by the Eparhi.
Some Americans have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the parish.
13-year-old child injured by sharks in lobster hunting in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday, while it slammed for lobsters in California on the first day of the fishing season, representative authorities reported.
The attack took place just seven mornings ago near the Baycon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamle shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he snuck with friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and he walked in with the whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamle first thought that the child had become tired and excited, and then he realized how he was shouting, “Get me!
He bit me!"
Hamle said when he got to the boy, he realized that the entire area of his key was broken.
"I called everyone out of the water because there's a shark!" he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the "Radi" Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to a critical condition.
It's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Gilles said in a media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water, a shark had been observed, but it was estimated that it was not of a dangerous nature.
Gilles adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of his body.
The responsible authorities closed access to the beach line Ponto in Kazablad to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours from safety considerations while the investigation was ongoing.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans offensive to the British market for decorative products
Sainsbury is facing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening standards for decorative products in its facilities, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK retail market, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and domestic products decrease, the largest retail retail stores will be located in 11 stores across the country, and then, if such initiatives succeed, will be discovered in more objects.
The investment revolution in the beauty industry is taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the stands, recently occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of the products offered up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, like the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-launchs its bottle range of mushrooms, so most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought for by younger users.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croedon, South London last week, until the second one will be opened in Selie Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online marketing and the shifting focus on the marketing of smaller quantities of food daily at comfortable times leads to the need for supermarkets to put more effort into attracting buyers.
Mike Coup, Chief Executive Director of Sainsbury, shared that the objects would look more and more like universal stores, while the chain of supermarkets is trying to deal with the Aldi and Lidl discounts, offering more services and non-food.
From Sainsbury they have Argos' objects in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitats' objects, since they bought both chains two years ago – which they claim from the company has increased sales of food and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to refascinate its facilities for decorative and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury had a joint experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended up after a dispute to distribute profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 objects of Celesio, who owned the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing the rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, trade director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the kind and nature of our charming stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training for our colleagues who would offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands proposed by us is intended to respond to every taste and all necessary in a pleasant location in a prison environment, which makes us an attractive destination for decorative products that presents a challenge to the very concept of the old way of marketing."
Peter Jones "bessen" after Holly Willubi's cancellation of the 11 million pounds deal
The Dragons Dan Peter Jones star "has got mad", after TV leader Holly Willubi has turned down a 11 million pounds deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willubi doesn't have time for the brand of home appliances and accessories True.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrou.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced his resignation to Instagram.
Holly Willubi left the Dragons Den Peter Jones star "to kip", after he got out of their business with the brand for the last minute – focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say Jones was "inflamed" when the "gold girl" on TV acknowledged during the tense meeting on Tuesday in the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckingamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that there will be no time for his brand home products and accessories True.
The business is about the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrou, as the rumors are that he doubled Willubi's wealth, whose value is projected at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willubi announced in Instagram his abandonment of True, Jones left Britain by plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the scales completely unplanned.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe that's full of waiters waiting for products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading 'This morning', which is one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions because of the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, as well as could lead to a slowdown in the launch of the market.
And not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, is a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willubi himself founded True together with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who was 52, joined the company as president in March.
Both families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willubi will become an "messer" on the M&S brand and will also replace Anna Mcparlin as the lead of the "I'm Famous" broadcast on ITV.
A source that is close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We do not comment on his business".
Heavy negotiations leading to the 'relationship'
He jokes about the criticisms he would bring from the news channels for making a comment, which someone would consider as "inappropriate to the President" and as too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump's answers in his hot "new" way.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting, after the first in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as "a major step towards removing the nuclear weapon of North Korea".
But the negotiations on the elimination of this weapon are in place.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's diplomat Ri Young Ho announced to the representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see reciprocity" by the US towards its country's first steps on the way of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US continues with the sanctions aimed at maintaining the tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were headed for war with this country.
Millions of people would be killed.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – stopping tests with missiles, releasing hostages and returning home to the bodies of American soldiers.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to behave as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to enter this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, facing the crowd before him.
Cunami and earthquakes in Indonesia desert the island and lead to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombard population were forced to leave their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unmistakable opinion that international aid is not required, which makes things a little challenging," says Mrs Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national disaster agency spokesman, Mr. Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently evaluating the situation in Palou to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unplanned for this type of natural disaster.
Although in Aceh there were shelters in the case of tsunamis, they are not often seen on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palo probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was given.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the majority of Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has moved to Palu, but it will last at least three days before it can reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has turned the remaining infrastructure of Indonesia into the centre of his election campaign, investing a large amount of money in roads and railway lines.
But the lack of finance keeps braking his office, while Joco's getting his urns back in next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, bows, and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
See: Daniel Stridge brought late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing in the High League against Chelsea goal in the 89th minute this Saturday of "Stomford Bridge" in London.
Stridge got a delivery from Jardan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was left with 1-0.
He set the ball on his left foot, then sent a precise shot to the remote corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penal field and directed to the top right corner of the network.
She's transferred the panoramic Cape Arisabalag and you're inseparable to the network.
"I tried to take a good position to control the ball because players like Shak are always looking for submissions in front positions, so I was just trying to earn as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," Sterridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the kantte laying, I pushed my ball, and I just shot without much to think about."
Chelsea took 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of her Belgian star One Azar.
The attacker of the "saints" submitted the fifth to Mateo Kovacic, then printed from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kovacic exchanged fast double delivery in the center.
Then he released a quick shot dog with which he took Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar ran over the defenders and noticed with his left foot in the remote corner next to the door of Liverpool Alison Baker.
Liverpool will face Napoleon in the group stage of the Championship League at 3:00 this Wednesday at St. Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton at the WeFA Europe League at 3:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings, clashed after the earthquake with magnitude 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, reports the press conference's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, is surrounded by ruins of the ruins.
Police arrest a man 32 years of suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after the woman's body was discovered this morning in Berkenhead.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from the stabbing of Grayson Mouse on John Street, as a 32-year-old man was allegedly arrested.
The police are asking for assistance from all of the areas they've seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg all who were close to John Street in Berkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with their desk cameras, to contact us, as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body is open is Berkenhead's resident and that she was found in private property.
This afternoon a group of friends who consider the woman their acquaintance came to the spot and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues when the police report that he is informing the victim's relatives at the moment.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mouse tried to get back to his apartment, but he was informed by the police that no one is allowed to come in or out of the building.
The man remained silent when he knew what had happened.
The residents have been informed that they will be allowed to leave for hours until they are allowed to return.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A grieving woman appeared on the scene.
She continues to repeat "this is so horrible".
Two police baths went through the border at two o'clock in the afternoon, while another van stayed outside.
There are cops in the border watching the housing block.
All available information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the latest memory hit by "rewriting the story"
Its ban will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that have been carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But "The Cromwell Society" described Mr. Creek's proposal as "bezzamy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in this debate to remove Oliver Cromwell's statues to the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The icono-conversion of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Crowell will be turned into a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent performance of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornichoff is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the story of a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped our nation's next development, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be noted and honored."
Prose-killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family as Juan, was found dead with the broken artery and covered in blood near the market corner of Leupanshui in the province of Guajou, reported on Sunday at South China Morning Post.
The pigs were prepared to inject their pigs with vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Sinin, China.
He was supposed to be here with his cousin from the neighboring province of Greece on Wednesday to sell 15 piglets on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and he also locked the door to the next horse open.
He also reported that there was a big male pig in the hut with a bleeding gurney.
The forensic expert confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, reports the report.
"My cousin's leg was bleeding and disfigured," said cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The recording from the security camera shows how Juan goes to the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pig.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The life killer did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager announced to Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else while the police collect evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been announced that the family of Yuan and the management of the market is negotiating a death benefit.
Although they're rare, it's been reported before about the pigs that attack people.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was severely injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig dragged a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him.
After an oregano farmer was eaten by his own pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba announced to CBC News that the pig is usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can affect them as a "spouse".
"They're just playing.
The pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they're not meant to hurt anyone.
But also a man should treat them with respect," the man concludes.
The weakened Hurricane Rosa will lead to honour and flood rains in the southwestern United States
According to weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa loses its weight as it moves over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is hurricane of category 1, considered to be 5 hours a week in the morning east time and is located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
She's expected to move north this week.
During this time, over the Pacific, I begin to form a cyclical, which moves east to the western coast of the United States. While Rosa is approaching the peninsula of Baha California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will start pushing the tropical moisture deep north to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Within the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching cyclone will create frequent heavy rains in the south-west.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, torrents, and likely waterfalls in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to valleys of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the south-west there are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible to have lightning floods in rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unreasonable to travel a trap in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to rising dust and bursting winds.
The approaching Sentinel will lead to heavy rains in some parts on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach valleys of more than half an inch, which will lead to carried small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season.
In the late week and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the four corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, it can bring great temperature fluctuations in the United States while the Arctic is cooling, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
There is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States this week.
There's about 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
In the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to increase and expand.
Most of the Central and Eastern US are expected to have a warm beginning in October, from the southern levels to parts of the north-east are expected to overcome temperatures of about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability for temperatures above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kawanau's hearing.
More than 20 million people saw on Thursday six television networks the attractive scene of the certificate of nominations for the Supreme Court of Brett Kawanau and Christine Blasi Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which occurred in the 80s of the 20th century.
During that time, political opposition continued, as networks interrupted their regular return programmes in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement, which was arranged by the Iranian Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI had to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% convinced that Kawanau had pressed her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kawanau, in her absence from emotion, is absolutely categorical that something like this has not happened.
It's probably even more than Nielsen's reported number of 20.4 million viewers watching the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct data available for other networks that broadcasted the hearing, i.e. PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally experienced difficulties in measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
For comparison, we're talking about a audience similar to that of a champion football game or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kawanau's appointment, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate republican came out with a statement that he would vote in support of Kawanau, the CNN and CBS cameras dreamt on Friday how protesters turned him on the ground while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During the entire brake for a few minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground, which was emitted live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Fleke refused that his office had already issued a declaration and, before closing the elevator's doors, announced that it would take place further during the hearing by the Commission.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided a smooth coverage of live several hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer the nomination of Kawanau to the attention of the entire Senate for the vote.
Ala Fleek announced that he would do this only if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against the nominations next week, for which the Democrats insist on opposition.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the senator of the party of the Democrats Chris Kuons.
After talking to Kuons and a few senators, Flek made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes for the approval of Kawanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kawanau.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "political games" with Brexit
Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "The Lady's Game Plan" for Brexit, suggesting that the collection of customs taxes from the UK for the EU and the reverse is "fullly absurd".
Wade Sims' shot: Police arrest suspect Dietian Simpson for LSU player's death
Police arrest suspect for the final fatal shot at Wade Sims, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, in his 20s, was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder charges reported by the Baton Rose police department.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, when the police report that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the spot and also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported by the branch of CBS WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police informed him that he recognized the fatal shot against Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, reported by Advocate.
The Medical Service of Eastern Baton Rose publishes a preliminary report on Friday, in which the cause of death is referred to a gunshot wound, affecting the head and the door.
They express their thanks to the office for investigating fugitives from the Luizian State Police, the police crime lab, the South University Police and local residents for the aid they have provided in the investigation, which has contributed to the arrest.
The Director of Athletic Sports of LSU Joe Aleva thanks local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rose, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average last season reached 5.6 points and 2.6 rickshaws of the game.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach announced that the team was "shit" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that "this is something that worries people all the time."
Volcano scatters ashes over Mexico City
The drop from the Volcano Popocatepetal ashes reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre has warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and ashes emissions have been recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center's been watching a lot of rabbits and tremors.
Posted in social media photos show a thin layer of dust that covers the front glass of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since an earthquake with magnitude 7.1 devastated central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, still known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the year of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protests clashed with the gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first year of the polarising vote to detach Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to mutilate peacekeepers with eggs and dust paint, creating dark and dust clouds on the streets that usually flow from tourists.
Later in the day, other police insights came along, and the police ran to their thumbs to control the situation.
For hours supporting independence groups shouted "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while the country's integrity was declared restored with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence of the region even one year after the October 1st referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The vast majority voted for independence, although the activity was low, as most of the disengagement opponents boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region with a number of violent clashes.
Wanted independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was made, but it was forced to go on a different route.
Narciss Termes, an electrician, joined a separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer hopes for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now it seems we're in a standstill," the man added.
Despite the marked important victory, it was a little different from the regional elections in recent December that support for Catalonia's independence political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most well-known leaders are either in self-esteem, or are arrested in anticipation of the process because of their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded his protest on the phone in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by both politicians.
His comment is that "it is becoming increasingly tense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catholic leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary process last year, announced that he would be nominated in the European Parliament elections next year.
He argues that "my candidacy for European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the repressions that we see by the Spanish government".
Londoners: Arrested men after the car got stuck in the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 respectively, were arrested after several times in a house in London.
The incident happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings announced that there were damage both to the gate and to the building itself.
It's also possible that she was shot in the car with an arbalette.
Menga's goal is to win Livingston with 1-0 over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
The new guy at the Livingston High League surprised Rangers and just put Stephen Gerard's second loss in his first 18th match as an ibrox club manager.
The goal of the Dolly Menga has become decisive, and Gary Holt's team has leveled second in the Hibernian ranking.
The team of Gerard remains without winning a foreign field in the High League during this season, and next week he faces leader Harts, from which he is left with eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers was home to Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone is already in a six-game race without losing in the championship, and manager Holt hasn't felt the taste of losing since he changed his post last month.
Livingston missed a good opportunity against the homeless
Holt's team had to lead the result far before he scored the goal, and his direct play style was extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his strike went away, and then Alan Litgou shot at the grid after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head on it.
The housekeepers left Rangers to play the ball, knowing they could seriously make the guests of static positions difficult.
And that's exactly how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, when Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and performed Manga, who took his ball and scored from the center of the criminal field.
Until now, Rangers had more control of the ball, but they faced the unfavorable protection of the hosts, and the doorman Lim Kelly was rarely supposed to intervene.
This style of play continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorkeeper saved Scott Pittman's foot shot, and a hit on Littlelow's head passed by the door after another static situation for Livingston.
In Livingston’s criminal field, however, the centers were well-purified, and the judge twice ignored the claims of the guests for the back – first after a consensus between Halket and the Glen Middleton reserve, and then after the doubts about the game with the hand.
"Penomental" by Livingstone – Analysis
Wiring of BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team's playing just superlative, continuing to exceed expectations and improving its performance.
The style of the game and composition almost did not undergo any changes after the team returned to the High League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he changed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing protection in an excellent way, while Manga was constantly holding Connor Goldson and Joe Warll under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under the direction of Gerard, they're showing you some great things, but in case they were a lot under those standards.
They were missing the last pass before the goal, only once they managed to break up the protection of the hosts – this loss must wake up Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Kyoln
On Saturday (29 September), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cold because of problems affecting human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey's admission to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kyle to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkishs living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25-mile crowd from meeting in front of the mosque, but despite that, many supporters were flocking around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds protesting against Erdogan, many of which Kurds also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's own policy and the German government's decision to allow him to live in the country.
The various protests reflect a breach caused by a visitor who is accepted as a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is despised as a despot by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The Colosseum rests after a car crash
The driver died after a car crash in London.
The catastrophe was near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and got medical help, but the driver died on the spot.
The disaster took place a few months after another coroner died, after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located close to a mile from the site of the Saturday disaster.
The headquarters police report that her employees are working to identify the man, then inform his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are turned off, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards were injured in the siege
Six prison guards were injured in a male high-security prison insurrection, reported by the Prison Service.
The riot broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worchester at around 09:30 in the morning of British time Sunday and still continues.
To this end, his administration has been called special staff from the Tordano unit, which will have to deal with eight persons deprived of their liberty, with the interference itself in a limited to one wing of the prison.
The injured supervisors suffered minor injuries on their faces and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service made the following statement: “There are specially trained servants who will deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six supervisors have received medical attention.
We don't tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we state very clearly that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, as their sentences may be extended."
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that after the prisoner's attack, the director of the prison was ordered to be treated in the hospital.
Also, in October last year, police officers from the parts of the struggle with riots were sent to prison, where they had a heavy blow against the staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with lightning floods Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the dried areas may benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great chance that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane of Rosa is being carried through the desert of the south-west, leading to a risk of lightning floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Uta, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finnisk on Tuesday, as during the late Monday she can bring rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix so far in 1950!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border."
The latest models from the National Center for Hurricane Forecasts 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas from the south-west desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with separate places possible up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rosa can in fact be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be useful, as the south-west part is currently in the drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitoring Commission, less than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second heavy category", reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the land of the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which can still be praised at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters over the Pacific, and that's why it's getting weaker.
That is why it is expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of floods.
"Summer rains are expected from 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, as they are possible up to 10 inches", they say from weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona to South Juta by Tuesday late evening.
"The main risk from Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Centre warns.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening light floods and various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landings in the mountain plains.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old child was discovered with stab wounds in Summerset.
The early boy was discovered in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Northton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
During the night in the Radstock area, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested, reported by the police in Avon and Summerset.
The cops are asking anyone who might have shot what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kawanau "has suffered from the disgrace and anger" of the democratic party
"Every voice for Judge Kawanau is a voice that rejects the cowardly and disturbing tactics of the democratic party," Tromp said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kawanau had "suffered by the disgrace and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kawanau testified to the Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blasi Ford's charge of sexual assault before decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The President made a statement on Saturday that "the American people today have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Kawanau.
"Every voice in support of Judge Kawanau is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public," the president said before the gathering a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president saw Kawanau's nomination indirectly as he spoke about the importance of the republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually also participating," Trump continued.
"That is why I am going round and fighting in support of good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats have set themselves as a mission "to prevent and impede".
The first key procedural vote in the Kawanau Senate is expected to be held not later than Friday, as reported to CNN one of the co-workers of the High Representative of the Republican Party.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increased
At least 384 people lost their lives, after many were taken from the smaller coast of giant waves, when strong earthquakes and tsunamis defeated the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palou on Friday, when evening the coast was marked from waves up to six meters (18 feet), took many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami hit after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, so many became victims of the disaster," said Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Agency for Disaster Management of Indonesia BNPB.
"The water had pulled with it its cars, trees, entire houses, hit everything on its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the coast.
"Some people retreated to the trees and thus managed to escape the water," he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24th center of Palu.
Published by the disaster agency images from the air showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, collected and destroyed bridges, as well as surrounded by the water of the mosque.
The second rabbits continued to lick the coastal city on Saturday.
The order of earthquakes was reached in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released from the Friday mass earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the released on Hiroshima nuclear bomb during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the damage as "great" and states that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the shitty buildings, added the speaker, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be higher on the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palo, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the truce.
He also added that "communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Dongala".
The red cross from its side indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already moved to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticised for not being informed of the defeat of Palu tsunamis, although officials explained that the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
Shared in social networks, love videos show a man on the top floor of a building who screams at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunamis.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall bursts into the shore and relates both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the clip in time.
Earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe interruption of electricity supply, which has stopped communications around Palou, thus making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities reported by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products of the first need.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pali on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunamis are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Dongala managed to reach Palo safely, where they found a shelter in the breezy shelters that were laid out in the court of their office, they passed a series of desert scenes, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the start of work on rescue and recovery emergency groups, some complain that those who have had a rich experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the financing, dispatch of foreign personnel and supplies can only be initiated if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The distress is still at the regional level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not yet declared such a status."
While above Palau falls the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subando, the coach of the national team on Indonesia's paraplanetics, has trained two of the missing paraplanes for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandadi added.
"As an elder in the field of paraplaneism, I bear my own emotional burden," he said.
Hendon recalled that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa Hotel reached the community on paraplaneism, he was desperate to send messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palo who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only answer to his messages was the one-one grey one.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Thieves raise $26,750 while charging a ATM in Newport of Levi
On Friday morning, the thieves raised $26,750 from Brink's employee, who was charging a ATM in Newport, became clear from the news release of the police in Newport.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM into the fun complex and prepared to charge it with money, says Detective Dennis Makarty in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “came running behind the back of Brink’s servant” and stole the purse with money.
The witnesses have noticed many suspects running from the scene, the message continues, but the police have not indicated the number involved in the theft.
All those who have information on the identity of the suspects must contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name
Rapper Cany West changes his name to Him.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man, officially known as the Cany West".
West, at 41, for a while, has been wearing the key to Him and is used as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change contests his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He changes the song Ariana Grande to the show, which was rejected "for emotional reasons", the show's creator tells us.
Except it's a reduction in his current professional name, West, and before he claimed that the word is religious for him.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where "you" or "you," West shared earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
"That's how I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He moved from Kenya, which means only one person, simply to Him – which is a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confusion, and everything.
The album is rather a reflection of our being."
Rapper is one of many known in his field who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of shortcuts and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference to the pseudonyms Louv and Brother Louv.
One of the former West co-workers, J.Z., also presented himself in an option with or without arrow and/or main letters in his keyboard.
Mexico's president swears not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that he would never use military force, which happened while the country was approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday of Tlatelolko Plaza President Lopes Obrador promised "never to use the army to push the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration of the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while students with left political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and finding more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States must double the financing of the development of the IMI
At a time when China becomes increasingly active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the United States has to double its research budget in this area, claims the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was sent after different calls from the U.S. government made statements on the topic for the II, although the US as a whole has no official strategy for the II.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: the country strives to become number 1 from innovations in the I.I. by 2030.
"The duplication of the EI development budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the US and are about to make next EI breakthroughs," Lee said.
The duplication of funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of FDI coming from the US, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "The II Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the lead executive director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest II companies in China – Face++.
In the 80s last century at the University of Carnegie Melon Lee worked on a system that won the most successful suit player in America, after which he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee is responsible for the past technological competitions of the federal government, such as the Agency's robotics competition for advanced defence research projects, and asked when the next one will be of help to identify the new visionaries.
"The researchers in the United States often have to work well to earn government funding," explained Lee.
"Not China takes the academic leaders, but corporations," the man said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on I.I.
Lee also claims that the changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its II programme.
"I think doctors in I.I. science should automatically offer green cards," the husband said.
The US State Council announced its plan to develop an artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions in the same way as the National Scientific Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explains Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry set up a Joint Intelligence Centre, which aims to include partners from industry and academic environments, and from the White House announced the creation of a Special Intelligence Commission.
This month DARPA also announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, more than $100 million is now invested annually in the development of FDI.
In the meantime, the US legislative body, which wanted to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not observed any activity for months.
Macedonians voting in a referendum to change the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this week whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would allow for a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a claim against its territorial integrity, which is why it imposes a veto on its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
Both governments have reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum himself, while at the same time the boycotting campaign casts a shadow as to whether the referendum will succeed in reaching the minimum 50 per cent required for recognition of its validity.
The issue of ballots is as follows: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that their price deserves to be paid in order to achieve the entry of the formed after the collapse of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the country's future, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result from it to the extent that the vote is already crucial.
In order to change the name of the country, two thirds of parliamentary representatives must therefore vote.
The National Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities were reported by 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Goose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from Skopje capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, in 54, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the tents covered by the boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proud heads raised, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his own vote.
The State party also stated that the positive outcome would lead to "the confirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published results of the study that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, the case of Macedonian TV Telma, reported that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote with "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious attack on the pro-Western government's policy since it won power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City goes through the entire defense of Brighton and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have overcome the protection of Bryton and have won Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Ethihad Steidym in Manchester, England.
Aguero's leaving his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine Golmaster was found with a passport in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Brighton before he printed the ball in the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped across one of the defenders, then left behind the rest of the Bryton's criminal field.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguaro, who struck with his right foot across the door of Bryton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero fights with some contusions in his feet," City Pep Guardiola's reporters reported.
"We planned he to play for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored the goal right now."
But Sterling was the one who secured the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match of the High League of England.
He broke up in 29 minutes.
In the situation of naked Aguero, he got a deep surrender in half of Brighton's.
He immediately released the left-wing dog to Liroy Sane.
Sonne progressed with the ball, after which he found Sterling with a passport on the distant grid.
The attacker of the "heavens" was able to cut close, just before the ball went out in the car.
City will face Hofenheim in a match from the group phase of the Championship League at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play certain fate of Rockies
After the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's no special sense for another game of a titular starter.
And yet the ambitious Shercer always hopes to be a titular Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the match is of importance to Rockies, who run a match with Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West ranking.
Rockies guaranteed their participation in at least a wild kart game after winning with 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is not yet certain that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a good match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will give everything of their own to win maybe the most important match for them during the year.
Why would I want to miss such a match?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but it is expected that they will allow Shercer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Shercer, this would be the 34th match as a starter this year, when he was practicing on Thursday and would have the normal time for a break until Sunday.
Washington's right-hand drinker has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 inches during this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The President of the Coso urged the situation with his electorate for the Brett Kawanau Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the republican votes in the general elections.
"After November everything we have achieved will be exposed to risk.
They leave five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that even though I am not a candidate, I actually look at myself, that is why I am fighting all the forces for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then he continued: “All of you see this terrible radical group of democracies, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to restore their power in any way, you are themselves witnesses of their integrity, of their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to run to get into power and management, because they're only interested in power and management, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, according to the President, have set themselves to "stop and stop".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democracies "stricken, evil, evil and unfaithful".
The president recalled the Senate Judicial Commission, referring to the senator of the Democrats, Diane Finstein, which caused strong riots from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – it was a really bad gesture – perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen."
The labyrinths are no longer wide open.
The party is not tolerant to those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, a few were surprised.
At the end of the day, I'm just the last member of the labyrinth parliament for now, who was declared not to be welcome, just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, has had a similar attitude, since he was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticises me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, those that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement during the previous leaders.
The report on Nottingham East's labyrinth meeting said Friday that "we want the assemblies to include all and be useful".
During most of my eight years as a local representative of the labyrinths in parliament, Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of a "lighter and more moderate" policy have long been forgotten if ever they were on the agenda.
It became increasingly evident that the different views were not tolerated in the Laberist Party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of this as much as it liked the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for before I thought shared similar political views began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I would never agree with – whether on national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I'm actually saying – there's a whole depressing tyranny in the social networks, where it's called for a response, a rejection of moderate politics, statements that I don't belong to the labyrinths.
It's not just me.
In the interest of the truth, I know that I have even drawn more luck from some of my colleagues, because the comments for me are at least primarily from a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and goalliness of these colleagues who face sexist or racist subjugation every day, without being afraid of them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such abuses have become the norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbin said the labyrinths should embrace the culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with any sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming increasingly tense.
In the last two years, I've got a lot of advice to bend, not talk so much, and then "it's gonna be all right."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the labyrinths 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thacher government, which, through neglect, led to a literal decline in my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who needed them most – either as a local advisor or as a minister.
I have never concealed my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state reaches Brexit, this will harm the households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the labyrinths.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are members of the labyrinths, or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of withdrawal or political rejection will deny me to act in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Airs led in the ranking
The two late essays may have changed slightly the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from Tennent's High League.
The team is already in charge of the ranking and the only one of the ten teams is without loss to the moment.
The better protection and the better use of the possibilities have become decisive in the game, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very happy.
"I am happy because the other teams have tested us very seriously in the previous matches, and we are still without loss," Murchi noted.
Robin Christi of Melrose said: “Congratulations for Air have really benefited from their position better than we have. ”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frasier Klimo, took Air forward in the result, but the yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by Waryers, allowed Melrose to grow in the result, after Jason Bagot realized it, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
Klimo increases the front of Air from a penalty hit just before half time, marking the axles after salt action, and then realizing the additional impact that made the result 17-5 for Air on the rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to Bagota, reduced the front to only five points.
Following the continuous stop of the game due to the severe contusion of Ruarid Nott, which was carried out to the wearer, and after the renewal of the match Air increased their advance after the chess of Stafford McDoual and the successful additional blow of Klimo.
Then Eer Blair Mcferson's current captain got the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerous advantages, being a strong pressure and realized the essays through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit, and when Stroan Hutchinson received the yellow card, after bringing down Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal execution Makferson carried out his essays with the help of the advanced Air offensive line.
Klimo realized the additional blow, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's shot ball and carried out Gregor Henry's wing on the flag for the fifth axis of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to have turned to a new career in the restaurant business
The star of the Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to have directed himself to a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in BBC's popular broadcast, which is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the transmission, and it seems that Kirnan is already planning his life after Creegleg.
According to the official registers, he is director of Agingermorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan intended to be involved in the "breathing restaurant business" of Glazgou.
"The sea is ours": the absence of a sea exit Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are constantly patrolling occupiers with the same sea staff in La Paz.
There's an ocean son flag over public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by law.
It's our duty to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit, handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as well as the call to sail again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest for decades here, while Bolivia is waiting for the judgement of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after it has been considered for five years.
"The force is in Bolivia, everywhere it feels integrity and unity, with the country expecting a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will see the condemnation of the international court of the big screen all over the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to go to a controversial battle for re-election the following year, has also invested much and much in the judgment of the court on Monday.
"We are very close to returning access to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the court's probability of making a decision for Bolivia is quite small, and even if it were to judge for it, it would not change things in reality.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to take over Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the international court is only six months after hearing the last arguments indicates that the case is "not complex", says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem of access to the ocean was separated from Bolivia's current government," Zarate said.
After that, he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric was different and that little was still Chile's good will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult after normal dialogue has taken place.
Both sides do not support diplomatic missions each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Welltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was made unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as the chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by reaching benefits for both countries".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political paterica".
"Bolivia will never give up its right to leave the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it won't continue with nuclear disarmament until it can't believe the US
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never come to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of relaunching the outstanding nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un from North Korea.
Ri called "empty hope" the idea that continuing with US sanctions and objections to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean war would make the North fall on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without Phanyan first making a significant gesture on the way to disarmament.
Both Kim and US president Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Phenian they are serious about abandoning their arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phanyan next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest piece of massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection from hats or to completely block the sunlight, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which laughed at the fashion stage during the Fashion Week in Paris.
The rather impractical hats caused a wave in Instagram during the summer, when designers sent their inventions to mock the fashion community.
Valentino's exploding proposal was an extravagance bee hat with a similar periphery of wide periphery, which literally swallowed the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included decorated with jewelry dins, magic hat and even pineapple – but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – at exactly the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had covered lips and reminded not as much of the superior fashion as of Hannibal Lekter.
One of the designs was like a diving equipment in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a hot funnel ice cream.
If you fall for such fashion trends, you're lucky.
Modern specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after "La Bomba" – the slender hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Ratakovski.
The cult to the extremely non-practice hat that took over social networks led to the emergence of another huge design of the fashion floor – a loose beach bag, almost as large as wearing it with a bath model.
The rafia bag with the color of the red orange, with rafia resin and coated with a white skin handle, was the attractive all-seeing article in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous Stylist Luke Armitid told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for extra-gabarite accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic distinction, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) aim to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can form and implement a personal learning program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that we understand, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
The results of this year's exams show that languages are first of all with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved high grade A.
The data collected from 74 students in SCIS schools show that 72% of the students achieved an A assessment in Chinese, with the same assessment being 72% of the German students, 69% of the French and 63% of the Spanish schools.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland take foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At the moment, the languages as a free choice by students receive the same attitude as the natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programmes of independent schools and beyond.
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Labour Commission in 2014 showed that for reasons of difficulty in finding employees, 17% indicated insufficient language skills.
As a result, more and more foreign languages become mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of a foreign language, which transforms these skills into essentials in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, once he masters such a skill that remains for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling few languages in front of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 full-time citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not have a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, as French was the only language whose government reached a double-digit percentage of 15%.
That's why the investment in language learning is important to the children now.
The rule of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in a future plan by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their area.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages must really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, together with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done.

Lebron will make his debut for Lakers this week in San Diego.
Waiting's almost over for the fans who can see Lebron James' first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the first match of the team from the pre-season preparations against Denver Nugets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's gonna play in the double.
"It'll be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," announced Walton via Lakers' official website.
The reporter for Lakers Mike Trudel told Tweeter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six matches from Lakers' pre-season training.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election meetings tonight at Wyling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump meetings, which include stops at known places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By deferring the vote for its election to fill the free space in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republics are threatened by the loss of control over the Congress in the submission of the votes in November.
How many hours will the Trump meeting be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wyling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours, east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wyling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump will probably consider hearings from this week for nominations for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano, in which tension arose due to allegations of immoral sexual activity, which held the Senate's confirmation vote for one week while the FBI's investigation was ongoing.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to build energy for the November elections.
That is why President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five meetings in the next week are aimed at "activising volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and we start a campaign season with commitments," Reuters spokesperson for the Trump campaign, which refuses to be mentioned.
The meeting, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wyling tonight, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second trip to Trump will take place this month in West Virginia – the state in which it won with more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who remains in the sociological studies.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to give him a boost in social research," said Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Rader Cup" 2018: US team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without an intrigue of "foursome" matches on Sunday afternoon might have brought what "Rader Cup" needed.
Changing the advantage in sport is a very subjective concept in which players believe unconditionally, even more in competitions like this one.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They led with six points, and now they're only four, so I guess we've got a little energy," Jordan Spyt said at the end of today's competition day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage at only twelve more to distribute.
As Spyt says, however, Americans have something else to show, and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge in the sport form of Spyt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spite shows a great shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The encouraging screams of the fans became stronger as he progressed in the round, in which with a precise blow he leveled the result in the fourth match, after remaining with Thomas with two strikes after the first two holes.
His strike, which won the 15th hole, was met with strong excruciating reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
"The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own match," says Spyt.
That's all that's left to these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points from Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitoud, the irreconcilable heroes of "Rader Cup" so far.
The strange but amazing couple from Europe won four out of four and it looks like they got everything.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "gods" on Saturday mornings or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successive successes, as well as the way in which energy was passing between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the view that they were the players who would win on Sunday and there would be no better couple than Flitoud and Molinari, who would bring the potential victory to Europe while the sun rises above Le Golf National.
For the preference of both at the same time on different holes.
However, the stories of European glory have become a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball matches in the morning while he was partnering with Alex Norren.
"Gods" and two "dabula" on the first nine holes have brought Spanish and Swedish into problems that they have failed to cope with.
But there's no other way in the week's games to solve your problems.
Fourball and Foursomem match are extremely interesting to look around because of the interaction between the two, the councils that exchange between each other, and the way in which a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
Europeans played better teammates, so they got a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome game session showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were deeply suspicious.
Europe runs with 10-6 in the last day of "Rader Cup".
Europe will have a solid front before the last day of the "Rader Cup", after taking the US with 10-6 after playing the matches of the "fourball" and "foursome" formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet of Tommy Flitoud and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the invincible Tiger Woods, with which their assets in the Le Golf National race grew to four points.
In an attempt to get back the trophy that lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn dominated tomorrow's "fourball" matches over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the 3-1 win series.
The U.S. was more opposed to the foursome matches, where they won two victories, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points of the 12th single game on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was Europe's first new winner, won four points in the row, and he and Molinari, known as Molywood, after this sensational weekend became only the second couple, won four points from their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After calling on Woods and Patrick Reid in the "fourball" matches, they were exceptionally motivated to defeat Woods and American novelist Bryson Decambu with an even more categorical result of 5&4.
Woods, who barely passed through his two matches on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated his geniuses, but so far there are 19 losses from 29 matches in the "fourball" and "foursome" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who got a break for the morning's "fourball" matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "foursome" clashes with the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka – respectively number one and number three in the world.
The European team, however, failed to enjoy a very pleasant, cold and cloudy day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult victory with 2§1 against the Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" matches, and later they returned to win Polter and Rory Makilroy with 4&3 in the "foursome" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the "Rader Cup" has been a team to raise four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the rules, Furik's team will hold a trophy even at equality.
However, after being beaten in two consecutive days, their chances of turning on Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm unilaterally, with no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened the mistrust towards the United States and there was no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organization, Ri Yong-how said that "significant measures of good will have been taken in recent years", such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, destroying nuclear testing and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and, under no circumstances, there is no first way to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri expressed known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps, the statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Phanyan did in the past.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea strives for the official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that Phanyan must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also objected to calls to facilitate strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists "first we remove nuclear weapons" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even oppose "the declaration of the end of the war," Rí said.
"The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting is planned between Kim and Trump, for which the US leader stressed earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister focuses on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jain over the past five months and adds: “If the country on nuclear disarmament was South Korea, rather than the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a halt.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of the previous year, when he said to the UN general assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States is inevitable, after "the evil president" Trump called Kim "a human missile" on a suicide mission.
This year in UN Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "full destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much work still exists and sanctions should remain in force while North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump stressed that there is no time for this and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phanyan for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue until complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop financing the Phanyan nuclear programme and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri in the halls of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Phanyan again the following month to prepare a second meeting at the top.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phanyan in July with the words that he had made progress, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of having made "gangster demands".
At the meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he sought are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard for sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year leads all students to sleep more in an effort to master the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that students at the university number one in the world often do not even think when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Hospital in Brigam and the Hospital for Women, prepared a course that he thought was the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep elimination on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me so now, in my last year?"
She said that no one has ever told her the importance of the dream that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barryra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course, after finding out that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The same course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a residence where students click on coffee cups, curtains, marathons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
The other part of the participants tell how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," added Professor Kaysler.
The culture of pride from "learning all night" still exists, he adds that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that the elimination of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – even to avoid filling, as the elimination of sleep in a mode of hunger that keeps them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler in the preparation of the course, taking one of his classes in Harvard his first year.
He says his course has "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step has been completed by all students to be asked to complete such a training programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends students to consider whether to set up a bedtime alarm and wake up and to know the harmful effects of the "blue light", emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circular rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal destroyed Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Gerard's immediate team and won a 1-0 victory for Livingston.
The ibrox team wanted to record its first victory as a triumphal guest in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team had just suffered the second defeat of Gerard in his 18s as a manager, who left his team with eight points less than Harts' failed team, a leader in the High League of Ladbrokes.
Manga scored seven minutes before the break, and the lack of constructive ideas from Rangers' team at no point seemed close to balance.
After the Rangers match, they're sixth, and Livingston's third, leaving Himbranian second only on the head.
For Rangers there may also be additional problems, since the side judge Kalum Spence got a head wound after he was hit with an object that was obviously thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that broke Air into the semifinals of the Cup of Scotland League.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same unit of Livingston, who pulled the point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team paired all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to note in the second minute, when Menga took out a touch of Scott Pittman against doorman Alan McGreeger, but half-protector missed the opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs' focus on the foul found Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense Alan Litgou turned the ball away from the back line.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have a butt in the 15th minute when he met Stephen Loules, but the reference Stephen Thompson rejected the claims of the Colombians.
Rangers only made two exact hits in the first half, but the ex-doorman from Ibrax Liam Kelly dealt easily with a hit with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weak shot of this Edjaria.
Although Livi's attack in the 34th minute was surprising in view of the ball's possession, it was absolutely deserved.
Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' deep focus again.
Scott Arfield doesn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who gave cold blood to Manga, for which it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacts to the rest, changing Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing gave Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out firmly and blocked the impact.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play comfortably for the home style of the game, as Litgou and Halket repeatedly rejected the sent forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to hit Jacobs, and with the next corner of Litgou shot his head next to the grid.
The one who entered as Glen Middleton's reserve of Rangers asked for a dump at the end of the double after a single fight with Jacobs, but Thompson saw nothing wrong again.
Anniversary: The Designer of the Gieger counter
A page from our annual Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day the future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Gaiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method for measuring radioactivity, invention, which ultimately leads to the creation of the device, known as the geiger's counter.
A corner stone in science since then, the gageer counter has also become a corner stone of pop culture, when in 1950 the film "Cornado's Campaigns" was released, in which the amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans apparently participated.
Man: “What is this, for God’s sake?
Rogers: This is a gager counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Surely he's shooting right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them into the laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are injected again in the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells has seen her ovaries' cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein, common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then injecting into the patient again.
According to Professor J. Berzofski of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Betasda, Maryland: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, white lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and their "learning" how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's make America big again," in our participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was released at the studio during Saturday Night Live, after making a meaningless performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would apply for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's make America big again," he announced against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
"I talk very often to white people and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star took on Brett Kawan's testimony to the Senate's Legal Commission on Sexual Violence Complaints made by Christine Blazi Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's performance record was embedded in the social networks of the comic book Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
Besides, West complained in front of the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They tortured me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't come out with this hat."
I've been tortured!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that it will wear Superman's costume, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
The comments sparked at least twice the public and the members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, one of them said: "The whole studio is closed."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West impersonates many with the performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle "Perie".
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "On one of the bravest: Thank you for making the most of it."
However, Karen Hunter's lead show said on Twitter that West was just "being himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (such as buying his music or clothing or supporting his "artificial") for whom I think he welcomes and distributes ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's who we are," she added.
Before the show the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, as now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Didi, Puffi and Pi Didi.
His friend, the rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lane, and the music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Charge for attempted murder after stabbing a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of "Igran a Thrones" Kit Harrington is against toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known for the role of John Snow's waving sword in the full with violence of the medieval fantasy series of the NGO "Play of Thrones".
But the actor, who is 31 years old, turned against the stereotype of cat hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they should be "grapes" in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something was wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the "Game of Thrones" Rose Leslie, also in her 31st year, admits that she feels "strongly convinced", that this problem must be solved.
"Now I am personally convinced – what have we confused about humanity?" he said.
"What do we teach adult men about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic manhood due to a lot of male characters.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught by television and the street that drives the boys feel they have to turn into this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big issues of our time – how can we change it?
'Cause obviously something's wrong with the young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in the prehistoric or continuation of the "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series next summer, claiming that he was "completed with the battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play part in the restoration of Sam Shepherd's "True West", a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently said that dating his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened in the Throne Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so that way he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays the game, the girl who loves the hero of Keith John Snow, in the fantasy show, wearing Amy's reward.
The two married in June 2018 in the family of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/Spain: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump on the number of people living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Only during the second trimester of 2018 were around 40,000 new cases reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way is almost zero, said China's health services at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities is widespread.
According to studies on conservative values, 70-90% of men who had sexual contacts with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to inadequate protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that there is a leak of senators from the Republican Party, he binds "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, a member of the US Chamber of Representatives Maxine Waters condemned the charges that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from the Republicans of Wikipedia's legislators' pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said the claims were made by experts and sites on the "ultra right wing".
"Liars, liars and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Uta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capital at the hearing of the Senate's composition on the charges of sexual misconduct against a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kawanau.
The escape is effective after the three senators have questioned Kawanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications is linked to the Waters office, and released information about her team member, according to Hill.
"This unwarranted claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is absolutely a lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including by the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flasher.
"In this denial there is poison," wrote Flasher.
"This implies that it does not have a temperature suitable for a Congress member.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be a challenge.
I shouldn't question the defendant's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism by judges Kawano's Democrats, who was accused by critics, that he also seemed angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a candidate from the Republicans for the Waters place in the intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"In fact, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had examined the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my team members."
Johnny English magazine exploded again – the weak spy parade with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for links to Brexit in every new film with British participation, and it seems that this also applies to the restoration of the Exchan-Comedy spy French for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English returns.
Will the self-sacrifice and ridicule that say how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new possibility for the nation's export?
In any case, the uncompromising Johnny English with round-eyed eyes and a "gum" person has the permission to repeat things for the second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a large comical creation intended for audiences of the cinema who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent, who despite his strange claims for a pleasant shine has a little of Kluzo, a little of Mr Bein and a large part of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony at the London Olympic Games in 2012.
In addition, it is originally based on the chaos that leaves behind a traveler and an international man who Atkinson plays in Barclaycard's already forgotten TV ads.
There are two good times in Johnny English's last movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, wearing a medium-sized gun, and for a short time his fingers stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to the physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strange, especially when "serious" films like "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be more focused on children than on adults, and Johnny English's mutilated accidents, I think, are not innovative and focused, as Actinson's game reminds Mr. Bein.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super secret network of spies and discovered the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the premiere, which is an overcrowded and embellished figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives everything to himself about this quazi-Teresa-May role, but in the scenario there is nothing to be done with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she should call a retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a school teacher in a chess center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons about how to be a covert agent: here are some good attacks when English is re-establishing a spy rock academy.
English has been called to Whitehall for rapid instruction and is reunited with his former long-standing assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a commandant of a submarine, a fun role in which Vicki Pepperdin's talent is little plying.
Thus, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and meet the fatal beautiful Ofelia Bouletova, played by Olga Kurileenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the villain Jason Walta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odise of parishes: dressed as servants, lit a French restaurant; create chaos when sneaking on the luxurious island of Volta; and English causes real anarchy when trying to use helmet for virtual reality to recognize the interior of the Volta house.
All the jokes are definitely taken from the previous movie, but since they're so nice and loud, there's a lot more content here for children.
A lot of intermediate production.
Like the other movies about Johnny English, I keep thinking: can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that corresponds to his talent?
The labers deny that they're developing a plan for British people to work four days a week, but get paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbin's labyrinth party is considering a radical plan that tells British to work four weeks, but get paid for five.
The party argues that the company's bosses want to provide the savings made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (IR) to the workers, giving them another day of rest.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
The sources say that the idea of the economic programme and the party's plans would be "hazardous" to decompose the country for the benefit of workers.
The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A higher source of the Liberian party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be announced before the end of the year for policy review.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day work week is an effort that is included in the approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Liberian Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this effort does not meet the approval of the entire labyrinth party.
Laberist speaker said: "The four-day work week is not in the party's policy I don't think about it."
The Chancellor in the Shadow John McDonald used the labyrinth conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from the "unfair directors" and "speculants" in municipal services companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadow also mean that the present owners of shares in the water supply companies may not receive their entire share, as the Liberian government could impose "arms" on the basis of the established violations.
He also confirmed the plans to include workers on board companies and create privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accumulate annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak "60 minutes ago" if the investigation of Cavano by the FBI can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavano slowed his final election to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question whether the Bureau's findings could have some of the senators of the Republican party withdrawn their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 minutes" Scott Pelly asked the senators of the Republican John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
After the incident, after that statement came out, I called him and asked, “Did you do it? ”
He was decisive, categorical and unequivocal."
However, Graham's voice seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavano and to change it, there is a need for a disturbing indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," added Graham, turning to Christine Blasy Ford.
“And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the “Global Citizens” festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday New York will host the festival "Global Citizens", an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and also performs such an impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the festival "Global Citizens" will gather tens of thousands of people of the great sea in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but will also meet the real goal of the event – the removal of extreme poverty by 2030.
The "Global Citizens" festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international group for protection, which hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "acts" as a voluntary participation, sending email to a world leader, calling the phone or connecting in another way to help raise awareness about their poverty eradication goal.
But how successful is "Global citizen" 12 years before reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert is a brilliant way to be convinced to demand action or is simply another case of so-called "clitivism" – people think they do something meaningful when they sign online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global citizen" has recorded more than 19 million "acts" from its supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected some 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include "Food Force", established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, engagement with "helping children to develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 posts on Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a historical note," the envoy of the "Food Force" Tracy Ulman told the public of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken, which call on Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, "The Power of Food", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In reply to one of the CZVs on his website, asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global citizen" answers: This will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But as with the great movement for civil rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardy Bi, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, which will lead to Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hu Jackman.
The United States can use military forces to "block" and impede energy exports – the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its military forces to prevent the entry of Russian energy products into the markets, including the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink argues that Russia's commitment to Syria – specifically, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our military forces, ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the events organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with a non-profit purpose that is represented as the "vote of energy users" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace the fuel," he said, while at the same time defining Russia as a "ponie with one number", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration has the task of strengthening the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project for the "North Stream 2" pipeline, which according to Trump turns Berlin into "occupier".
Moscow stressed several times that the 11 billion-dollar pipeline of the North Stream 2 that will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s burning opposition to the project is merely produced for economic reasons and is an example of untrustworthy competition.
"I believe that we share the view, energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), called for the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the presidential nomination in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "take a serious look" at the presidential candidacy after the mid-term elections.
During a city council in Holioque, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that I was considering applying.
"It's time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy."
Warren expressed his opinion about President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he “runs this country in the wrong direction.
"I am anxious to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was exposed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano.
In a Twitter post Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a sociological survey conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should be applied in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be nominated, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
Sociological research has shown more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party, discussed on potential candidates in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he'd take an official decision in January, reported Associated Press.
Sara Palin referred the PTSR to Trak Palin at a meeting for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years ago, spent a year in Iraq after the September recording.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, after returning, is known to other families that feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the wounds that soldiers are going to face," she told the audience at the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little changed, corroding, returning and wondering if they will receive this respect, which they and their brothers have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, was included in the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of emergency, according to Dan Bennet, spokesperson for Vasil's police administration.
18 states and districts in Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts of Colombia support the judicial challenge of a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum for victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of the 18th States and the county submitted a request for goodwill in Washington in support of the asylum seekers and contesting the policy announced by NBC News.
The full name of the petitioner on the Grace v. Sessions case has not been disclosed, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed against the federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected the asylum request on 20 July.
She's been detained in Texas.
The state lawyers who are helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers come to the United States, such as nations facing comprehensive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned the decision of the 2014 Immigration Appeal Council, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District attorney Colombia Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "neglects decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances and such a prohibition violates this principle," the report says in good faith.
In addition, lawyers claim in the report that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants is harmful to the American economy, arguing that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour."
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to stop providing asylum for victims fleeing domestic abuse and gangster violence.
"A refuge is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions said in its communication of 11 July on politics.
The asylum has never been designed to ease all the problems – not all the serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while the death cases are doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation centre in the desolate city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance carries more corpses.
Clean water is dirty."
The residents are noted to return to their ruined homes to try to save something from their floodwaters.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake are filled.
Some of the sufferers, including Two Harris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, were found outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated openly due to the ongoing second trisomy.
His eyes are filled with tears when he recalls how he felt the severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I think I was pressed in the destroyed wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accused China in "Tormus" with "propaganda"
One week after an official newspaper in China released an ad on four pages in an American daily on the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US envoy in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday US President Donald Trump called for a paid publication of China Daily at Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of seeking to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Peggy is trying to interfere with the US Congress' election, noted what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to issue commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in a escalating trade war, which balances import tariffs between countries.
According to U.S. and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which support the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and a former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing had returned US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brandad writes in a comment in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "now doubles this brake by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the government of China has benefited from the respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press in America by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, on a newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With the Kawano massacre, the Republicans reject women voters for inter-elections, warns analysts
As many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend the nominations for the Bret Cavano Supreme Court in relation to several sexual assault charges, analysts warned that there would be a response, particularly from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around it are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue to vote.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Racher, professor of politics at Maxwell School at the University of Siracusa, in front of The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rahr said he doubted whether the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s insistence on an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pier, senior advisor and national speaker for the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters ran "Noemvri comes!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to continue with the nomination of Cavano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasy Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," said Stu Rothenberg, a party-free political analyst.
"The people say that the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among the electors of women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court nominations, analysts assume that she can follow a response if the Republicans insist on confirmation of the candidacy.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavano is placed on the scale. It is about how the Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it," said Gai Cesil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose democracies.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to believe as a result of Ford's and Kawano's testimony, with a little more tending to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 percent say that according to them Kawano probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
After Flake's insistence at the moment, the FBI investigates Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Debor Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate's judicial commission that Kavano attacked her in a state of emergency when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals before her while they were at a party during her follow-up in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Team Burners-Lei starts a start that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with an open code of Burners-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lei, the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "online storage of personal data" or POD.
It contains lists, list of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through every browser, and at the same time is all of them at the same time.
The unique online personal data store is that the user determines who has access to the information.
The company calls it "give power to personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Burners-Ley, Bruce, security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a project work contract, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are completely renewed for one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lei wrote that the mission of Inrupt was to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid base.
In 1994, Burners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Ley has had a strong influence on the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although Inrupt starts, Burners-Lei will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Ley added.
Bernard Van: In memory of the priest, awarded with the cross Victoria during World War I
They mark 100 years in the native city of the only Anglican priest worthy of the cross Victoria for his participation in warfare during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 in the Bellengise and Lehaucourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, not knowing that he was worthy of the highest military honors of the United Kingdom.
A monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandsons on a parade in Rusden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years from his grandfather's case, awarded with a medal.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very heavy fog and under heavy fire by artillery and cartoons."
Later, he attacked the fire line and with "incredibly bravery" led the building forward before attacking an artillery weapon with one hand and beating three of the crew.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me calm."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, placed a wedding after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the strength of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that all night long you're waiting to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can't become witnesses to the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 doubles, including six of the main cards and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they were built up to the early hours, especially due to the duplicity.
Phen description on Twitter switching the child's animation film as "some kind of painful joke".
"The government regulates that this content is not appropriate at 6 p.m., so the program was changed with child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa pig", yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said they would work on planning the meetings to include British audiences in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six mornings a week and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place here on Sunday and there – on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages, and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that kind of government.
I can promise you next time this won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five doubles instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we crossed.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt "low" because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started to study in high school, he didn't realize that "not all are like me."
In an interview on the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he spoke about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to care less about winning the Olympics.
The permanent leader of the long-term show, Cursty Young, is in the hospital for a few months.
In his first programme, Lavern Dale said he felt "less" of all the others while he was growing up, as "you didn't have to like girls and boys."
He said: “To this day the feeling of inferiority and the fact that I am different from others are, in fact, the things that give me energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so I didn't disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronze Medalist became an active participant in the LGBT campaigns and used his participation in the British Community Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and he wanted to inspire "hope" for others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Blake, whom he met in 2013 – he was "surprisingly surprised."
Dale concluded a marriage with Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than him last year, but claimed that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so much when you're so young," he says, "it's hard to find someone of your age who's had such a fall and a fall."
Both of them became parents in June, and they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Daley himself says "his whole sight" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would tell you that I'd only be interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized by his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale told me that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about is if they already have tickets for the London Olympics in 2012 – as he wanted to be on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be with me, Dad, or the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until I stopped breathing and at this moment when I realized that he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not vulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I've been dreaming about it all my life – to jump to the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no more fearful feeling," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games and still makes him stumble.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
The lost form of Mikelson remains on the Rider Cup scale on Saturday.
American Phil Mikelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at the Rider Cup, but he will have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record to be connected to a failure.
Mikelson, who took part in the two-year event for the 12th record, was left on Captain Jim Furik's "fourball" and "foursome" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. team, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows away with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old sportsman, who was never even at the top of his career among the most right-wing players, is not in the best form for the difficult game of Le Golf National, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong hit.
And if the game itself is not uneasy enough on its own, on Sunday, Michaelson will face the precise champion of the British Open French Molinari, who is on the team with the new recruit Tommy Flitoud and are trying to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who leave four points before the 12th single match make a strong start, it may prove that the Mikelson match is absolutely decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his associate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, he sneered at me, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He's confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Glory and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing only in two matches.
I expected him to play more, but that's just how he got it, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be at the golf course and play, as well as everyone else."
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for most Ride Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career at the Rider Cup, which has never been close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furick said his presence also brings other benefits to the team that are not measured with numbers.
"He's fun, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think even younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than that just to play."
Thomas Björn, the Captain of Europe, is aware that the big front may soon be a step forward.
Europe's team captain Thomas Bjorn knows from personal experience that the big front, piled up before single matches from the last day of "Rader Cup", can be easily removed.
The computer debuted in the game of Valderrama in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but precisely in the final right was almost achieved and barely managed to win with 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You continue to remember that we had a big front of Valderrama; we had a big front of Brookline, where we lost, and Valderrama we won, but very hard," said Bjorn, after the European team won with 5–3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, with 10–6 of Le Golf National:.
So the story has to show both to me and to everyone in the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Get out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's finished until you see the final result on the table.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All the time I've been saying that I think only about the 12 players in our team, but we're also aware of our opponents, who are the biggest players in the world."
Satisfying with the performance of the players at a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush with the holidays.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's pre-planning will come out of individual performances, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but when you go out alone, then you're testing your entire capacity as a golf player.
This is the message that must reach players: tomorrow you must give the best of your own.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he has to give himself up to the end."
Unlike Byorn, the captain of rival Jim Furick will want his players to appear better individually than as partners, such as exceptions are just Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas, who took three of four possible points.
Furik himself was from both sides of these great reverses in the last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then he was from the losing side when Europeans performed the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, took his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw on Brookline, as well as on Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under tremendous stress.
So we formed our composition and distributed our boys as we wanted to, so that we could try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to conduct our counterattack and face Rory McKilroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitoud and Jan Polter will meet other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I chose these players in this order, because I think it gives us the greatest chance of success," Bjorn said of his election for the singles.
Germany defers the launch of a new warship
The German fleet's latest fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but this would not be achieved until at least next year due to inadequate systems and mainly growing costs, local media reported.
The introduction of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the brand new fragments of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted an army speaker.
The floating court had to join the military forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We understand that they will have powerful weapons, a set of air and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some solid technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest brakes must be able to be used up to two years before returning to the home port.
However, continuous delays mean that the avant-garde military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will already be old when they enter operation, says Die Zeit.
The F125 crashed into the headline last year, when the German fleet officially refused to release the shipyard into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the ship returns to the shipyard after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of major "software and hardware defects" that make the warship useless if sent to a military mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleets will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older crews of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has shown that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the military forces to add future superstructures.
It is believed that the 7,000 tons of Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project – including equipment training – is also becoming a problem.
It is estimated that the staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) have been achieved – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest brakes are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the military forces of Germany are emerging.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartelles, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, admitted that the fleet "exhausts from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said that the problem had become bigger over time, as the old ships had been operated, but no new ones had been provided.
He complained that no piece of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the fleet.
National Trust Follows the Secret Life of Adhesives
A new study carried out in accommodation in the Scottish mountains is aimed at determining how the trailers use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying bats and will help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from Scotland's National Trust will follow the often-recorded stickers, as well as the coffee-eyed watery nights at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the rental to track the activities of trailers during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the call sounds of the adhesives, as well as what types they publish.
Then a map of the residence and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the adhesives and how they are used of any kind.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work on housing management, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for the trailers and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the population has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their homes and lead to the loss of their homes.
The risk to populations may include wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, the adhesives are not blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an improved ecolocation technique to address insects and obstacles to their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the attachments very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who carry out regular investigations, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first in Scotland and the only special reserve for adhesives in the Thrave property in the Dumfries and Galway area, which is home to eight of the ten species glued in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's name says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great area for the trailers," he noted.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and completed a suitable residence.
But there are many more things about the adhesives that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasises that it is important to check the availability of adhesives before carrying out asset maintenance activities, as it is possible to kill up to 400 female and young adhesives, as well as destroy the entire local population.
The adhesives are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, freeze, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish servant in the Trust for the Protection of Adhesives, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our beauties and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape and his lawyers will trial a German magazine.
Christian Ronaldo defined the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to be known", using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German journal Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape by American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims that he then paid her $375 000 to silence the incident reported on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video in Instagram, turning to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the publication of the claims 33-year-old Ronaldo sealed the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is a fake news," the gold ball's fifth carrier told the camera.
"They want to be known by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to build a popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to judge Der Spiegel for the claims that they call "an unacceptable publication of personal life suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said that the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football room where they claimed he had raped her Annally, according to the documents filed in the district court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the Ronaldo incident he fell on his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" of "99 percent", but in the case he simply submitted to "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's papers, he confirmed that they had sex, but that's what happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and was taken photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "feared by revenge" and worried that she would not "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to terminate the agreement, as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of Ronaldo's incident, he was on the verge of joining Real Madrid of Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italy's Grand Juventus for a sum of 100m euros.
Brexit: Britain "will regret forever", that it has lost car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever", if it loses its status as a world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they will temporarily stop production in their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of delaying the border in the case of Brexit without a transaction could lead to loss of jobs.
In the factory in Brunston, where the Auris and Avensis models are produced, nearly 150 000 cars were manufactured last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain left the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fears about leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they're going to close their mini model factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in Brexit’s cases without a transaction.
Toyota's production line works in principle "at the right time", with the parts arriving at every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a transaction on 29 March, there may be problems at the border which, according to the industry, may lead to delays and lack of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than one day to fill their inventory in a factory in Darbisher, said by the company, and that's why the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's "shammat" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to get this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio's 4's Today program.
"After the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to ensure successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot tell how long production will be stopped, but in a longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cualaris, who has worked in Burundi for 24 years and is the founder of the United Union in the factory, said that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: “I try to think that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
A government speaker said: "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed for another week", as he continues to fight for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential impediment to the judiciary by the President.
This is whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General, or not to threaten the independence of Mueller, for months he's been feeding up the rumors about Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prevent us" fired Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal commission, which they testified to both Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of complaints against Kawano, even more delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's spokesman, Sara Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this is not yet fixed, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I've always been trying to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The head of the report, Chris Wallace, asked for the reason.
Sanders rejected that rare press conferences were not due to the "demonstration behaviour" of television journalists, although he said, "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstration behaviour."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, adding, without quoting the evidence: "We have checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the US President, this is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often, and you're witnesses to practice it quite often in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President may show why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior before the gathered journalists.
Minister of Health addressed EU workers in Scotland's National Health Service with regard to Brexit-related insurance
The Minister of Health addressed EU staff working in Scotland's National Health Service in writing to express the country's appreciation and desire to remain in their seats after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter to the remaining less than six months before Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected in this autumn.
But the UK government also makes progress in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to remind you how much I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is of benefit to the patients and communities to which we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we'd love you to stay here."
Christian Abercromby undergoes emergency surgery after receiving a head trauma
The Tennessee State Tigers Linebanker, Christian Abercromby, undergoes an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury during the Saturday meeting when his team lost from Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Senior Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reid, told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the half.
"He went to the side line and somehow just fell there," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel submitted Abercromby's oxygen to the side line before it was placed on the conveyor and taken to the accessories for further review.
Tennessee State official confirmed in front of Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercromby was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the nature/seriousness of the trauma", as well as that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercromby, a secondary student with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, which makes a total of 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher herb tax when purchasing real estate in the UK
According to new plans of conservators, foreign buyers will be charged a higher share tax when purchasing real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in herb tax will affect those who don't pay taxes in Britain
The state holding expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher herb tax when purchasing real estate in the United Kingdom, as additional revenues will go to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and is directed to people with high incomes.
The increase in herb tax will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenues helping the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The addition – which is an addition to the current herb tax, including the higher levels, introduced two years ago for second dwellings and properties purchased for surrender – may amount to up to three percent.
The state holding expects revenues to increase by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13% of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price increases and making it difficult for people who buy their property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become "primarily cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy only appears a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in herb tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by robbing the land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the quotas for affordable housing to repair the "watch with the British housing".
Mr Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including the control of rents and the end of the "no wine-free" expulsions.
He also wants to provide councils with greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not proper for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies to buy as easy housing as those who work hard in Britain.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the pollution from sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland's team"
Sanderland Manager Jack Ross said that "the greatest ambition" in his career was to be the senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge of re-establishing a club from North-East England, which is currently in the third position in the First League, at three points from the first place.
He passed to Stedyum of Light this summer, after last season brought St. Myron back to the Scottish High League.
"I wanted to play for my family as a player.
I wrote a match for the B team, and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportssound.
"But I grew up with the armies of Scotland of Hampdon, which as a child we watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"This opportunity, however, would only be opened if I had success at club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sanderland managers are names like Dick Advokaat, David Mois, Sam Allardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletik's former teacher said he did not experience anxiety as an heir to such established names in such a well-known club, as he had previously rejected offers from Barnes and Ipsuic Town.
"For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It won't be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I'll assume I've achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years, after spending some time as an assistant in Dumberton and for 15 months at Harts' training station.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Myron from a winning team to the Championship during the next season.
Ross said that he now feels more comfortable than he did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlipul, Folkerk, St. Myron and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really on the cross," he remembers when he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best future for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds weird because I did well, I made good money, and I had some significant success.
But sometimes it's hard to be a player.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still faced with the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I've really done it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin for my whole life."

The perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, discovers research
Summer heat increases the income of the fighters to survive British pubs, but increases tension for the chains of restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the business-consultant CGA, which made up the statistics, said: "It has been a long time since England's expected participation in the World Cup, in July following a similar model as June when the audiences reported growth by 2.8%, but the restaurants received an even stronger impact.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and drinks bars reported the best results in their growth compared to the lower movement of restaurants.
Food bubbles have also suffered from the sun, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In the pubs and bars the sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while in the food there was a decrease by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, from the recreation and entertainment analysts of RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we observed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food business managers and only time would show if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in branding.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data for the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is a solid indicator in the industry.
One of five children hides their parents' secret profile on the social network
One of five children – some barely 11 – has a secret profile on a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of false Insta pages
The news raised fears that sexual material should be published
Twenty percent of students said they have a "basic" profile that shows their parents
One of the five children – some of the 11 – creates a social network profile that keeps the adults secret.
A study of 20,000 high school students shows growth in false Insta accounts – a transfer to Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raised fears that sexual material should be published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean "basic" profile that shows their parents, while at the same time have secret profiles.
The mother, who went to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "violate him".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) at independent schools found that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It is crucial that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Elid Doyle was chosen to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as Director without executive functions of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's lighthouse with most achievements, and President Ian Byit has set this move as a great opportunity for those leading to sport to take advantage of her rich experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilide is delighted to be highly respected in the light-wing communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that light-to-light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attractiveness," Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of athletes and I really hope to be able to contribute and help promote sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won the finals of 200 and 400 metres of the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got hit a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show me whether or not I would recover.
It was an exhausting job, but I got a full recovery, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing movement training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
Advertising for cream pump that compares mothers to cows, share online opinions
The company that produces cream pumps divides online opinions with advertising that compares nursing mothers to cows that are breast-feeding.
To mark the launch of the market of the expected "first noise-free feed pump in the world suitable for wear", the consumer technology company Elvie released a cool music video advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the new feed pump provides to the feeders to express themselves.
Four true mothers dance in a cow's band, full of hay, on the background of a song with text, which includes: "Yes, I come, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not what we see, these are my breasts".
The poem continues: “Expect, pump, with them feed the babies, pump, pump, touch your friends. ”
The advertisement, however, published on the company's Facebook page, causes online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it reduces the "fears" of the dairy processing industry.
"It is a very stupid decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The feeding pump Elvie gathers discreetly into a feedingstuff (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "So inadequate advertising."
Others defended the ad, as one woman admitted that she considered the song "extremely fun".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy myself one if I was still breast-feeding.
The cutting made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little fuzzy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is brilliant," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny advertising aimed at mothers who give up (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like "blood".
It is not advertising, praising or condemning the dairy processing industry."
At the end of the clip, the group of women discovers that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bodies.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who feed feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely soundless, no wires or tubes and is gathered discreetly in the back of the blankets that give women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they're running out.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, comments: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves brave and provocative marketing.
By drawing a parallel between the dairy cows and the dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the drying of the cream and all the challenges associated with it, while at the same time showing more fun and understanding the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump falls into the leading news.
During the fashion week in London's mother, two children appeared on the stage for designer Marta Jakobovski using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although the monthly crossings of the border remain relatively unchanged, partly because sharp rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration made it difficult for children to be found with claimants.
Usually most claimants are immigrants without documents that are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the family should provide fingerprints, as these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking officer in the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who wanted to become advocates of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Approximately 80% of the persons who are either accused or members of the family of the accused are illegally resident in the country, most of whom are foreigners.
So we'll keep chasing these people," Albens said.
In order to cope with the registration of these children more quickly, the authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to officials in custody.
Many appear in a video conference, not personally, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are defined as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to officials in receptions and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers have said that this concern has grown in large facilities, such as those in Tornilo, where the signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the place.
They added that moving the children to the "palatsk town" without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends can make the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges "occupational troops" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
The Mualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally staying in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "they will take appropriate action".
"They must be removed immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "war against terror is near its end" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed" by terrorist organizations and "every illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian members, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the countries devastated by the war.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that the conditions are favourable and can be returned, accusing "some Western countries that "feel indiscriminate fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have encouraged the international community and humanitarian organizations to support these returns," he said.
"They are turning into political issues something that is a completely humanitarian issue."
The US and the European Union warned that aid would not be provided for Syria's recovery until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war was reached.
The UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last great fortress of the rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a massive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
The House stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida front, who would "be destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of government members and opposition members, to form a draft of the future Constitution of Syria and to conduct the way to elections.
Mulem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "the review of members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win second term
On this logic, Trump will win the election again in 2020, unless – as many liberals are likely to hope – his presidency will not be cut short because of the impeachment and scandal.
That would certainly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there's no sign of fatigue in the audience.
From 2014 onwards, the premium rate has increased by double to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the premium, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC is at the top at a cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at dinners with big news.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Bayer, an executive producer of the ABC's "Last Candidate" drama, where it speaks of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skowl, a veteran screenwriter and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club”, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Skowl told me that he said, "Why is he laughing at me?"
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that appears on television, Washington's stories can determine the future of "Rou v. Wade", whether immigrant families can regroup, as well as the good state of the world economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, the desire to inform a citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Udurd, who uses "deep historical information" as a source of his book "Strah"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket of crazous skin for $15,000 ( "dried full of arrogance" according to "Washington Post") and the striking descriptions of Stormi Daniels about Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way.
"The honor of what he does to make you feel part of the reality show is to give you a little every night," said Brent Montgomery, the lead executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, regarding the changing participants and the day-to-day selection (commitment with the National Football League, praise of Kim Chen Un).
You can't let yourself miss an episode because you're gonna stay.
When I contacted Mr. Flaiss this week, he was on the northern coast of Kauai sun, 80 degrees, but he was closed at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
It could not be separated from the television, especially when Brett Cavano had to face the Senate's legal commission and that depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those stupid lectures and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flyes told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments affect the most controversial competition in the early elections for place in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the redeployment of Congress districts and from there two titulars for the same place.
Recently, the redistribution of the district in Pittsburgh suburb refers to conservative democracy Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district of partial elections last spring.
Lamb faces another titular, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly represented by the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the parties' main funding institutions, the Democratic Congress Commission on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb was found in Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The position was occupied by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts believe that democracies have a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to the leaders of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because "the early decisions no longer be recognized by Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson of the Department earlier this month.
But sanctions were only provided against El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately US$ 140 million for the fight against drugs for development and economic aid.
The sanctions proposed, including the reduction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be punishable for the State of Central America with its unemployment and percentage of murders.
In advance of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served to continue such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in the effort to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior management authorities clarified that their wish was to hold the conference, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens now announced that he would participate in the conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomats say.
And the three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new severe messages or sanctions from Washington.
The spokesperson of the White House for Mr. Bolton turned down a comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who wanted to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Study history
The next move may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on possible obstacles to justice by Mr Trump, as the report is now a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is directing his investigation and whether Mr. Trump has taken a stand with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If Congress' leadership changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body, exactly when he prepares to stand before voters, and perhaps even to court-martials composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor is it the same in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make these choices that will affect how long the struggle will take.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, until the West had resigned and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of the clan.
The course of history depends on such busy moments, and the improbable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
At the moment, the Americans are facing a number of similar captures.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper announced that last year he proposed to write down the president in secret and speculated that it was not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the history of Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavano, demanded by the FBI, is not complete or fair - or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite the charges of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if that forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail on these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because I got a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, who was driven to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the candles for Shabat on that table, wearing a satchel.
With inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior collaborator of Brookings Institute, is president of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is an optimist for a rapid Vienna match.
Rangers are home to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move ahead with Group G of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knee did not allow semi-defencer Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the 2-2 equality with Villareal concerned, but he believes that for Rangers this result could turn into a trampline to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Vilareal is a good opponent," said 31-year-old footballer.
"We entered the match with the hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality seems fair.
They were better during the first half, and we were better during the second half.
We've taken a look at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the past meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our audience we can give everything from ourselves and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened along my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone the way.
The team is good, and the guys are really having fun, training is useful.
I hope that we will be able to exert all the forces to forget the past season and achieve the desired success."
Women worry about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what concerns they would like to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said that they had discussed with their husbands the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% of them talked to their children about it.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not predetermine your wishes.
Together with your advisor and your family discuss where and how you want to get your concerns, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with the idea of how to pay these expenses.
Your decisions, when you choose a long-term financial institution, may include a traditional long-term insurance officer, a mixed life insurance officer with a monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles at the beginning.
appoint a health care officer, so that you have a certain trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial officer.
You can choose a trusted person who will make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in a written form to prepare you.
"This is not only about the financial aspect, but also about who doctors will be," Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a massive earthquake and tsunamis that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to rise.
Due to the interrupted communications, aid organisations cannot receive information from the Dongala Regency, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palus after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palou is the capital of the province of central Sulavesi, located at the end of the narrow beach edge of the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamis hit it.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The regency, which is smaller than the province, is a population of approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palou and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian post-disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Cunami took over the western part of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "The Pacific Fire Ring" and is regularly covered by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves of tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong rainstorm on the 26th December of the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggers a wave of tsunamis, which hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island on the shores of Sumatra.
2006: Trus with a magnet of 6.8 is the largest island in Indonesia, Java, by activating tsunamis, which breaks into the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake 7.6 hits near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: Earthquake 7.5 hits one of the islands of Mentawa and activates a 10-metre wave of tsunamis that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Plattko earthquake hit Pidi Jaya's regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the deserts of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, no tsunamis were activated, but more than 100 people were killed by broken buildings.
2018: Strong rabbits killed the tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people died, most of them from the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sara Palin's eldest son is arrested for domestic violence
Trak Pailin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sara Pailin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, a 29-year-old, from Wasil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in domestic violence and resistance in arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman's sex tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Pailin is detained in the Mat-Su Preservation Building and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, reports KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "innocent, certainly", when he was asked to sue, the media reported.
Pailin is threatened with punishment for three Class A breakthroughs, which means he can be deprived of liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also indicted in a class B offence, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first time that a criminal charge is brought against Pailin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sara Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Court of the Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in reporting a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon under the influence of injecting substances in connection with the incident.
His friend claims he hit her with a fist on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died of an earthquake that devastated the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Earthquake 7.5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network is interrupted, expecting the number of dead to rise in the near days.
The earthquake hit close to central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
Social networks are turning video that shows the moment of conflict.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palo when the wave tsunamis hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors from New York want a death penalty for Saifolo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York, where eight people were killed – a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, at 30 years of age, used a truck hired by Home Depot to carry out the attack in October on the bike near the West Side highway in the Manhattan Valley, as well as pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intended" killed eight victims and "intended" caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent in connection with the request for a death penalty lodged in the South Region of New York.
According to the court document, both charges can be executed with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judiciary filed a 22-point indictment to Saipov, including eight counts of murder related to a racket commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of the IPS.
The attack required "serious planning and intention", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov was executed as "wonderful, cruel and deceptive".
"Syfolo Habibulaevic Saipov causes injuries, harms and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decad, Daran Drake, Ariel Erly, Ernan Felci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last South of New York looking for a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug addicts, but was subsequently sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence on a federal case was executed in New York in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conspiracy sentence and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed at the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek nationalist, showed no remorse during the days and months after the assassination, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of his phone IDIL, the indictment claimed.
He also asked his hospital room to set up the IDIL flag, which was shared by the police.
He pleads innocent on the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "evidently disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a sentence for guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously wanted the prosecutor's office not to want a death sentence.
Member of the Conservative Parliament says NAYJEL FARAZ must lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz vowed to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest at the conservative conference.
The former leader of the British Party of Independence said that politicians should "taste pressure" – as one of the members of Teresa May's own party, he proposed to lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have gone out so far", if Mr. Faraz was secretary of Brexit's issues.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to agree with the party's deep-separated lines was underlined by conservatives who supported the stay who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to preserve his compromise plan "Checkers", despite the attacks by the supportive Brexit, the remaining EU.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and insist that the Eurosceptics and labyrinths choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon said to the protesters with the slogan "Outing means getting out" in Solicle that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Faraz should have been involved with the others and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If it was the beginning, we would have left," he said.
Wellingbrow's MP added: "I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan."
Commenting on his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be rabid.
We want to create our laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the claim that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The understanding that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely wrong".
Conservator Andrea Jenkins also participates in the meeting, sharing with the reporters: “I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually went out on the street and really helped us be elected.
Please drop the "Checkers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “The ministers keep their position when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Faraz said at the meeting that politicians should be "pressed" if they intend to change the decision taken after the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brexit and we're meeting here today to say, "We won't let you get away with this."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country, which has helped us win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporting remains passed through Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
Chepa activists were picking up flags with "Conservators against Brexit", after the group started this weekend.
Laiberist Lord Adonis played with the conservatives on the security issues of the party's application when it was discovered at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all of Canada's technology and yet, for the unimpeded crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he'd "think seriously" his bid for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would "consider the opportunity to apply for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Masachusets Democrats spoke of his future during a city council in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will be candidates for a re-election in November against the state representative of the Republics of Jeff Dale, who was the joint president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is in the centre of speculation that it can take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the village building after Trump entered duty.
One of the present asked her if she was planning to apply for president.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top."
He was arrested for the death of Sims from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that he had a suspect arrested on Friday at the shooting when LSU's basketball player Wade Sims was killed.
Baton Rose's police department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 east time.
They posted a video from the shooting on Friday and asked for help with the identification of the man seen on the cameras.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"The Wade Sims is shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade got involved to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene, he had a gun, and he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson is arrested without any problem and detained in the arrest of the police department of the Eastern Baton Rose.
A young man with a height of 6′6′′, grew up in Baton Rose – Sims participated in 32 games with 10 matches as a titular last season and recorded on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Gran Pri of Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after the team's instructions helped him win Sebastian Fetel
Ever since Walter Botas graduated from Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds, allowing Fetel to attack his associate.
Fetel first made a pi-stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial for the outcome of the race.
Mercedes also made a pi-stop on the next round and went out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat him after a rough maneuver and driving "gum to rubber", which forced the Ferrari pilot to release the inner part of the track in order to avoid punishment for an additional time after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double protection maneuver on the third turn.
On top of his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back lines of the start grid and was seventh after the end of the first round.
After that, he even led a long time since he decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly to beat Kimmy Rayconen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered the foot-step in the 44th round, but failed to grow enough in the next eight rounds and finally Raikonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Walter did a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me fight him.
The team has done an exceptional job to win the first two places on the podium," Hamilton said.
That was really a bad language of the body.
President Donald Trump filed with Senator Diane Finnstein on a rally Saturday for her claim that she had not circulated the letter from Christine Blaze Ford, which accused the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano in sexual harassment.
During the discussion of the raids in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's legal commission, but instead commented on how the incident in the Senate shows that people are "bad and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can happen and the good that happens in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Finnstein sent the letter with details of Ford's claims against Cavano in July, and it was distributed earlier in September – but Finnstein denied this distribution had happened from her office.
"I haven't covered Ford's claims, I haven't spread her story," Finnstein told the commission, The Hill said.
"She asked me to keep confidentiality and I kept confidentiality as she wished."
But her rejection was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
She may not have, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the Supreme Court's applicant charged with sexual crimes against three women, the president stated that the Democrats used claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore their power with all possible means.
Look at the dishonesty, the shame, they don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they have to run, to regain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundi Scarar 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundy.
Dandy Schar returned for Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Yellows, winning a five-thirds bonus in Dundy on Saturday.
Giantes led a two-ball game early after Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilleer hit.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauni settled for the housekeepers before Dwyer restored Giants' front.
Francoa Bushar is equal to Dundy before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elit League for Adam Kiff's boys who got out of the bottom to win Dundy in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
That was the fourth clash between the opponents of this season, when the Giants won the previous three matches.
The blow that Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendal McFaul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubled his advance, assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense beginning, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to balance with the help of Cowni at 15:16.
Duyer tried to get Giants to take off before the first break, marking the second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar rebalanced the odds with a powerful blow at the door at 27:37.
Cunny and Charles Corkoran have united efforts to help Nilsen give priority to Dundy for the first time at the end of the second half, by giving everything from himself and confirming the victory of the team with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who lost the last four matches of total five, meet as hostess Milton Kins for their next match on Friday.
The pilot of the plane died to ensure that hundreds of people aboard the plane can escape from an earthquake
A pilot of flights in Indonesia is praised as a hero after his death, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board has managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulavezi on Friday, triggering wave tsunamis.
The strong secondary rabbits continued to defeat the area, and many were caught in a trap from the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, would manage to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided to crash.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Control spokesperson, Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives reported by ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths may reach thousands after the disaster response agency in the country has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Bhutan is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under fractures, and many people cannot reach," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Pala, where there is mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the nurse brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There's nightmares everywhere in the minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The red cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joco Weidodo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?", CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was devastated by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reported that a person is in ignorance after an aircraft crash in the lagoon
The aircraft that flew with an aircraft that crashed into the Pacific Ocean now announces that a person has been declared missing after earlier stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking aircraft.
In the press release Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon they cannot contact a male passenger.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find a man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the island of Chuk.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that the sixth passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
They leave no clear reason for the catastrophe and the precise sequence of events.
Both the airlines and the U.S. military forces said that the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was over the track.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane was very low.
"That's very nice," says Janes.
Janes tells us that he and the others managed to cross through the deep to cross the water to reach the crash exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the stewardess had panicked and screamed, as well as that he had suffered a slight head trauma.
The U.S. military forces report that mariners repairing port nearby also helped in the rescue action, using an inflatable boat to cross people to the shore before the plane falls into the depths of about 30 metres of water (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network suggest that in the last two decades 111 people have died on flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The Prosecutor's Office concluded its statement on Saturday in the retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulet of the US Ministry of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to collect the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said he got data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to check on Sanford.
Sanferd stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town this day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck the same night, Sanford said that "this is a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records indicate they've known each other for barely a week.
Roulette pointed out that shortly after the death of Chambers Telesis, she had deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He took her away from her life," Hale said.
The protection is planned to begin with its concluding findings on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be presented to the judges later that day.

The Fugees and Commons performers in the UK through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A New Yorker judges a couple after being fired for a "racist" message
A New Yorker judges a couple for dismissal because of discrimination after receiving a wrong message sent by the mother, who complains that she is "the other black girl".
The two deny that they are racist, conforming to the demand for "extension".
Linzi Plasko-Flixman, the mother of two children, was crazy when she found out that the new baby girl, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"Noeeeeeeeeeeee, rapporteur of the Black House," wrote in a text message to her husband's wife, Ms. Plasko-Flixman.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flackman felt "unsightly" fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former bartender, who was an African-American, did not do the job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for one working day after being sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris judges the couple for compensation for the dismissal, wanting the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, although she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that," she said before Post on Friday, adding, "You're sure this is discrimination."
In response, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that the cessation of Morris’ employment was a reasonable act, as they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after they tried her.
"My wife sent something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you tried, even if it was wrong?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
In imitation of the demand for "extension", Plasko claims that his wife was born only two months ago and found herself in a "very difficult situation".
“ Will you attack someone in this condition?
It's not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, denying them their conduct and logic.
Padington's editors were afraid that readers would not feel connected to a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, relates about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun now that we're aware of the great success of Padington."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before he was inspired to write the children's book for a little game game, would feel optimistic about any rejection of the book, adding that he met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings", after his death last year.
With regard to Padington, whom she describes as "an important member of our family", she added that her father had secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-governing," she said.
"But since you felt that Paddington was so real, it's like having a child that's achieved something: you're proud of him, though it's not really your job.
I think you've somehow taken the success of Padington in this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merit of his own Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was released, she was rushed to the hospital, Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors struggled to save her life.
"The cloud kept ringing, to say that the situation is really bad, that it does not expect to survive," said Ms. Eden-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by her doctors to maintain her heart slowly stop working and abandon her system.
She's gone for a while before that and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should've struggled."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, who has so far been mourning the loss of her daughter, is on board the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test she's going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I had my head lifted and all the time my tears covered.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming feeling of complicity with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grief women set up cards to prevent suicides from bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones for suicide try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put on a bridge in Wells with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him after the smile.
They've always said that his smile shines on every room."
However, he quit his job before he left, and he was in "a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that this will have some consequences."
Ms. Davis created the cards, “to let people know that there is someone to go to and to talk to, even to be a friend.
Do not keep silence – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphrey, a long-standing friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed or depressed, or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his state.
He came to the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he looked neither at them nor at anything."
She said it was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to deal with it: “This opens up a gap in the family.
He's breaking us up.
But we have to move forward and fight."

Brett Cavano's future is under discussion after the FBI launches an investigation.
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants – research with limited length and limited scope – perhaps we could unite our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the Commission would "distort" despite the confirmed suprapartie blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct a investigation?
Their desire is for the moment.
The early elections are only after five weeks, on 6 November – if, as expected, the Republicans do not appear well, they will seriously affect their attempts to elect their representative in the highest court in the state.
George W. Bush called senators, urging them to support Mr. Kavano, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice-President Mike Pens to announce equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea "decreases" in Kim
South Korean legislator claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came into power seven years ago.
Park Beeong Sug, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, said last year there were 1127 refugees, compared to 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the tighter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human smugglers, are the key factors.
There's no official comment from Phanyan.
Most of the refugees from North eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the illegal border from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and passes easier than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two corners.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, often repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Phanyan for talks focused on stopping nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work in general for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US of the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be sure of our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way of being isolated first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavano "a hysterical" and said it wasn't suitable for service in the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the Nancy Pelosi Congress called the candidate for the Bret Cavano Supreme Court "esteric" and said he was too unbalanced for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi comments this during an interview this Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way to think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would call her "esterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kawano's testimony to the Senate's legal commission on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the claim that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavano was very emotional, at times he almost screamed and felt when he was discussing his family and his academic years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in the Commission, calling claims against him "a greek and coordinated attack on the personality", organised by liberals who are not satisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that according to her, the testimony of Cavano proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, since it has become clear that he is prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he himself is disqualified by these claims and by the way in which the Clinton family and the Democrats are persecuted," she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if he would try to discredit Kawano if he was appointed and in case the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only naive to enter the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Now Kavano is a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a democratic, she was concerned about the potential decisions of Kawano regarding the Act on Accessible Health Care or the "Rou v Wade" case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kawano was avoiding questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for an upright, convinced man to enter court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it great,' concluded Pelosi.
And women must have control.
This is a fundamental criticism, after months and years of anger spreading, and she cannot accept it without crying.
"I cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive director somewhere who shared that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to whom when she was angry and crying, she told her counselor, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed in the expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my brightest memories of previous work, in the office primarily with men, is how once, when I was inflamed with unexplained anger, a woman older than me caught me by the door – a stinking leader, from whom I was always a little afraid – and she dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have done it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign as president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an extra-marriage relationship with the yacht called "Monkey Business", he withdrew from the competition, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of candidates for the president herself.
"It wasn't a well-considered solution," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competition and the last thing they wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the situation "Snow and the Seven Dwarves".
Since it's late in the campaign, it stays with the fundraising and decides it won't stay in the race if it fails to collect $2 million.
The battle is predestined to fail.
She understands that some of her supporters who give $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During his speech, in which he states that he will not continue with an official campaign, she is the hall of so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which makes it so difficult to collect money and you can turn to voters, not delegates, and anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I've got a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder, how the media reacted.
"Someone can think that Kleinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"She's crying?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the US and China were deafening and, while the battle is fasting, a gap between the two countries will benefit Beijing in a long-term plan, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning bell this year, betting with taxes key elements of China's export, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation of the tension appeared this week with the new customs duties affecting production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with an effective tax burden on half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Every time Beijing returned with a new fee of five to ten percent of American goods for $60 billion.
China pledges to give up every hit in the US and soon the second largest world economy is not expected to ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to the demands, but to keep his head public in front of Washington would be too ashamed of Si Dzinpin, China's president.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war can help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that an accelerated political decision, both in Washington and in Beijing, can create conditions for an economic crisis in either of the two countries, is in fact more dangerous than the observers previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a scientific associate on issues related to Asia to the expert group Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests for assistance in the recovery of the country devastated by the war has continued for more than seven years.
In return for the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian help.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any aid in restoring the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe won the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the "Rader Cup" for 2018, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 of Le Golf National on the coasts of Paris, France.
Thus, the US has six other losses on European land and have not won the "Rader Cup" in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the champion crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Björn reached the required 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The United States star Phil Mikelson, who appeared weak in most of the tournament, sent his first hit on the 16th hole (with "pair") in the water with which he lost his match against French Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari presented himself well in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reached a balance 5-0-0, since the competition took place in the current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spyt lost categorically with 5&4 of the player in the team of Europe, located at the lowest place in the ranking – Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 of Ian Paulter from England, for which this is probably the last part of "Rader Cup".
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participation in the Rider Cup, became a European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing its assets to 25.5 points this year.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't hold on.
It was a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can raise the cup again.
Above all, the team is the most important, and I am happy that I was able to help," the excited Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He's handing over his cousin John Ram's staff, who won American legend Tiger Woods with 2+1 singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud that I won Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his overall balance of "Rader Cup" is already 13-21-3.
Foreign statistics for one of the biggest players of all time, won 14 major titles – an indicator on which only Jack Niklaus retreats.
The U.S. team was having trouble all weekend, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf in all days of the tournament.
U.S. team leader Jim Furick said after the disappointing performance of the team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we pressed a team on Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm dropping Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players seemed very good.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the Association of U.S. Professional Golfers and our Committee on "Rader Cup" and look forward to it.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can keep your opponent's hat down.
We were just overcrowded."
New for Red Flow: Concentrations decrease in Pinelas, Manuti and Sarasota
The latest report of the Committee on Fish and Wild Animals in Florida shows a fundamental reduction in the concentrations of red inlets from the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Committee, there are reports of conditions for growth decline in the districts of Pinelas, Manuti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolier – this shows a decrease in concentrations.
Water compartments with an excessive colour of the red tide spread to approximately 130 miles on the coast, from the northern district of Pinelas to the southern district of Lee.
Participants with plants can see 10 miles from the coast of Hillsboro, but they're less than last week.
Red tides are also observed in the Pasco district.
In the past week, there has been evidence of moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or slightly inland in the Pinelas district, low to high concentrations on the coast of the district of Hillsboro, high concentrations assumptions in the county of Manuti, high concentrations assumptions in the coastal or inland district of Sarasota, moderate concentrations assumptions in the Charlotte district, high concentrations assumptions in the coastal or inland area of Lia County, and low concentrations in the area of Collaire.
Information on the inflammation of the respiratory tract in the districts Pinelas, Manuti, Sarasota, Lee and Kolier continues.
There have been no reports of inflammation of the respiratory tract in Northwestern Florida in the past week.
