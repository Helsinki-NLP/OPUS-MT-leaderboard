Members of the Assembly (AM) of Gales are concerned about "looking muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Gales Parliament (MWP, for their English stamps).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculousized.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned about "remaining with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means cocoa.
A member of the Assembly of the Gales Party commented that the whole group was "discontented" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the MWP-muppet speech jump was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter or in Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the members of the Assembly will be the issue of the members themselves."
The Gales Government Act 2017 gave the Gales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals that revealed broad support for calling the Gales Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option obtained most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly seem to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle for consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on change in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disability of members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how they should be called when deciding on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country's name change
The voters will vote on Sunday whether the name of their country will change to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its North neighbour is a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum participants, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
San Martín’s campaigns keep silent about the difficulties of Harlem’s churches
"Historically, the older people I have spoken to say that there was a bar and a church in each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is nothing or other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"Now socialist people in another way," she says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors regularly go."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, could replace themselves with buildings of apartments full of people who would not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who change to these apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation was formed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that served as a center of worship acquired the building.
A black congregation took the laughter of San Martín, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to street merchants 125, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were able to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and while Father Johnson's happy plans for his reconstruction were also in charge of the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor".
In July, the expert who touched the carriage called: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, at the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first carriage of the world used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who went to play the carriage of Riverside Church, of greater size, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some happy people complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiburon wounded a 13-year-old boy who was looking for langostas in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child on Saturday as he scurried in search of langostas in California the day the langostas season opened, according to the authorities.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed San Diego's KSWB-TV channel that he had been running with friends for a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited to have caught a langota, but then he realized that "he was screaming that they had bitten him
email-custom-header-Security
He had the broken clavicle," observed Hammel when he came near the boy.
"I cried out to everyone who came out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press wheel that had seen a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed trauma injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, to Swami Beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that the majority are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the corridors of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK's beauty market, valued at 2,800 billion pounds and with an increasing growth compared to the fall in home fashion and handling sales, the largest beauty corridors will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country and, if they succeed, the same will be done in the most shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain seeks ways to use space in cabinets that were used for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also restore its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something more and more demanding by younger customers.
In the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will also prove its concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments, the first recently opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week. The second opened in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and daily changing to buy small quantities of food in local stores force supermarkets to try to convince people that they are visiting them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that shops will increasingly look at malls while the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount facilities by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has integrated sale points of Argos discounts into hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has boosted sales of food and made these purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its departments of beauty and pharmacy was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the sales revenue from pharmaceutical items into its supermarkets.
The new strategy is based on the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's commented: "We have transformed the appearance and the environment of our beauty corridors in a way that enhances the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistable destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy."
Peter Jones is "barred" after Holly Willoughby breaks an 11 million-book agreement
Peter Jones, Dragon's Den's star, was "further" after the TV show Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million-book deal with his life-style business line to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and True plugins.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning announced that he was leaving the business in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furnished" when the gold girl on TV admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate herself to True, her brand of fashion and compliments, during a tight meeting held on Tuesday in the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to duplicate Willoughby's fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced that he was leaving the business in Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly was, by contrast, Holly's main priority.
It was going to be their long-term future, which would keep it in the next two decades.
Its decision to leave left all those completely trapped.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the release of this Morning presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of the important investment in products that go from kitchens and candles to clothes, and possibly delay even more their launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago who maintain a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had a 40% share in the Baldwin TV producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A source near Jones claimed that last night "it wasn't about business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He laughed about the criticisms he received from the media by making a comment that some would consider "unprecedental" and that he was so positive about the Nordic leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump commented with his ridiculous voice of "news reporter."
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump was commended for the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a great step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders meeting in the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country did not see a "adequate response" of the United States at the first steps towards the disarmament of North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the US continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his half.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have generated positive results: the end of tests with missiles, help to free hostages and bring the mortal remains of US soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but so, instead of 10,000 people being there trying to get into this full stage, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump commented, pointing out the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and a earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population in Lombok had had to move, there was no national emergency, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which complicates things a little," Mrs Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children are preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are not yet sure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Emergency Agency, explained that the authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly poorly prepared when nature withdraws its anger.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, there are not so many in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami alerts in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, has contributed to the loss of life.
In the best case, traveling from one island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate logistics even more.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the key to the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the worn-out infrastructures of Indonesia in the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has dedicated a lot of money to railways and lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr. Joko's administration, which is facing a re-election next year.
Moreover, it must face the pressures of Indonesia's persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while gangs of Christians and Muslims were fighting in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the marker before Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in minute 89 on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri to something more than 27 metres from Chelsea gate when the marker was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second pole.
The action sent him over the area and directed himself to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell on the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to play with the ball and players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give me all the time," Sturridge commented to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I said a touch. I didn't think too much of it, I was just throwing the shot."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The midpoint of the Blues made a taco pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning around making a stream near the middle field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the balloon and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice passage to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished throwing the balloon into the second position net with a left foot kick that Alison Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 3:00, Liverpool plays against Naples in the group phase of the Champions League. The meeting will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country ' s emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the ruins of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude earthquake of 7.5 that occurred on Friday and that dropped waves of up to six meters, according to the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported during a press wheel.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with fists on Grayson Mews, John Street, which subjected the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder.
The police have urged the people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the initial stages, but it would encourage anyone who was close to Jonh Street, in Birkenhead, who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend any person, especially the taxi drivers, who could have picked up something in the Dashcam to contact us, as they can have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is Birkenhead and found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe that they know the woman came to the scene of the crime to know where they found her this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but the police tell him that no one can come in or out of the building.
He was perplexed when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to return in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
Don't stop saying, "It's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing within the cord controlling the floor block.
Any person who has information to send an email to DM @MerPolCC is requested to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously in the number 0800 555 111, register 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the last commemorative success by "rewriting history"
His ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and a "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that taking the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster became a goal.
The iconoclasy of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
He may be sacrificed to Cromwell mistakenly by the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the history of a figure that many consider worthy to celebrate.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, the monarchy is clear.
If this is a very precise description, it is a question of continuing with the historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century mid-century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and commemorating."
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a goat in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead with a blood artery sectioned and covered close to a handful of the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, as South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder is prepared to inject vaccines to pigs from a pig in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that the door of a nearby pouch was open.
He said there was a big pig in his pocket with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig of nearly 250 kg had attacked the goat until death, according to the report.
"The feet of my cousin were bleeding and ravaged," said the cousin, to whom they address their name, "Wu," to The Guiyang Evening News.
The images of the security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence on the spot.
It seems that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man injured with gravity.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 295 kilos reached a shepherd in his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After that, in 2012, some pigs began to eat a goat from Oregon, a shepherd from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "disposer".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What you have to do is have proper respect for them," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will leave strong widespread rains in the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa caused wind flares of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane from Sunday to Sunday at five o'clock in the east and was located almost 620 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean they are beginning to generate low pressures, which are moving east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to drive the intense tropical rains in the north, toward the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 20 inches [25 cm] of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain strikes with the low pressure approaching, there will be strong generalized precipitation in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, streams of debris and possible spills in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitations of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersal nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding may occur with conditions that quickly deteriorate.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture in the desert by foot.
The strong rains could turn the cannons into embraved rivers and storms will cause cold winds and dust clouds locally.
Low pressures approaching will leave strong rains in concrete parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to about two centimeters of water, which could cause small streams of debris and cause the roads to be resbalded.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaplains will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and the first hour of Monday, before the rain generalizes at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the U.S. can be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the heat of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic temperature changes in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines ( Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of the summer will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S., a warm October is expected, with generalized temperatures that will range from 26 degrees south to parts of the north-east.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures could reach up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above average for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's presence
More than 20 million people followed the testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, said Thursday in six television chains.
Meanwhile, politics continued to be dead, and the media interrupted their usual programming to relay the latest Friday news: an agreement designed by the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Blake, for the FBI to carry out an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he had absolute certainty that Kavanaugh had touched her as an alcoholic and that he had tried to get her clothes off at an institute party.
During his passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented Nielsen saw it on Friday.
The company accounted for the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems to calculate how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that of an American football party of the playoffs or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fueled the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during an all-day appearance, Nielsen pointed out.
ABC occupied second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the presence, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a communiqué informing him that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras caught up on Friday morning with how some protesters yelled at him when he tried to go up to an elevator to attend a meeting with the Judicial Commission.
As he received these complaints, transmitted directly by the CNN, he turned down.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?"
And he went on, "You have power when there are many women who don't have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more in his presence with the Commission.
The cable and radio television channels broadcast it all in direct hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote on it.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which had been requesting some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of going out of the European Union to "make politics" with Britain's future and to undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published next to her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on her attack on the alleged Chequers Plan for the Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the tariffs of the other was "totally absurd".
Wayde murder: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, has been arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police pointed out that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses in the scene of the crime and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After asking Simpson, the police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A loan of USD 350,000 has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Instruction Court issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicated that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The Department recognizes the merit of the unit of fugitives of the Luisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, the sports director of LSU, thanked the police forces in the area for their "diligence and search for justice".
Yes, he was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than two meters old, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 turns in a last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, said his team is "destroyed" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"These are the things people always worry about," Wade said.
A scenic volcano in Mexico City
Ceniza from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they were staying away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas emissions and ashes within 24 hours.
The center recorded several earthquakes and earthquakes.
On social networks, images showed fine ash layers covering the vehicle umbrellas in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed a greater activity in the volcano, 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters faced the riots while thousands of people participated in opposing demonstrations coincided with the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized referendum on secession.
A group of separatists who had been cut off by the anti-disturbs threw eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Post-hour clashes were also held, and the police used guns to hold the fight.
For several hours, independent groups, with messages such as "not forgotten nor forgiveness", faced unionist protesters with the cry of "Viva España".
Fourteen people were treated for slight injuries during the protests, according to local media.
The tensions remained high in this region one year after the vote of 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters chose independence for the overwhelming majority, although the participation was low, as the individuals opposed to the secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote at electoral tables throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
The independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support to the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said that he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although narrow, in the regional elections last December, the pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to keep the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, whether in self-taxed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been initiated by politicians on both sides.
"If you're getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the return to democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for embezzling a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after repeated landing a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was caused to access and to the building itself.
At some point, the car may have been shot with a ball.
Menga's Attack Gives Victory 1-0 to Livingston Against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston assured the victory
A promoted Livingstone impressed the Rangers on winning the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox club.
The Dolly Menga attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's men went up a position with the Hibernate in second position.
This season, Gerrard's men have not yet won any victory out of the house, and next Sunday they face Hearts, board leaders with eight points of advantage.
Earlier, the Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday at the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded its race of victories in the division to six parties. Holt, the holder coach, has not yet tasted the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lets chance pass in front of a perfunctory visitor
Holt's team had to have taken a step forward long before marking, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson survived the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow fired the shot away after he entered to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with the balloon games.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston searched for an entry, with a combined game by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time, Rangers dominated possession, but they couldn't pass the host's defense and porter Liam Kelly was quite quiet.
That game continues until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, Rangers' Porter, rejected a shot by Scott Pittman from a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another liveston game.
In the area of Livingston they entered long steps constantly, but they were always discarded. Two requests of penalti were rejected, one after a Halkett entry on the alternate Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
Livingstone's Phenomenal (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to surpass the expectations of an upward trajectory.
Your game style and your template have only experienced changes since your rise, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has reinforced the team since his arrival.
He was with a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was enormous and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they remained short.
They failed to materialize the games, as they only got into the opposite field once, which is a call for attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO's allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open up a huge new mosque.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers were in the immediate vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurdish, were also heard who condemned Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive them in the country.
These manifestations reflect the division that this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocratic by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident took place near the crossing of Beswookd Street and Evelyn Street, a road that ran from Deptford, to the south-east of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was cared for by the paramedics, but he died there himself.
The accident occurs after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran away on Childers Street, almost two kilometers from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six agents injured after some disturbances
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison management.
The disturbances began in Long Lartin's prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue.
Experts from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, with eight internals involved and affecting a pavilion.
Agents were assisted by slight facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesperson for the prison said: "It has been deployed to specialized prison personnel to deal with the current Long Lartin prison incident.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and let us make it clear that the officers will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars."
Long Lartin's prison receives more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disruption officers were asked to approach the prison to deal with a serious altercation in which he attacked prison staff with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (arid areas could be benefited)
It is uncommon for tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week that comes when the last collections of Hurricane Rosa go through the south-west of the desert, at the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in west Arizona, south and east Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to direct herself to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only "the ten hurricanes had preserved their tropical storm or depression on a 321-kilometre Phoenix radio since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Hurricane National Centre provide between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rains, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Scarpe in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated areas, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocos Mountains and the Grand Cuenca.
In places where there is no risk of sudden flooding, the rains of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the dry conditions currently being experienced in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Drying Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least extreme dryness, the second highest category, as reported in weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route will absorb the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricaneed force with maximum reefs of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north to 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing power.
Thus, it is expected to rise in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which run a considerable risk of flooding.
"There are expected torrential rains between 7 and 15 centimeters from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters", as reported in weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of that Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Later, she will move through Arizona to the south of Utah at the last hour of the night of Tuesday.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Lower California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west of the U.S. desert," notes the U.S. National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and streams of debris in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and one 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after being found by another 16-year-old with white gun wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton at 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remained "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in Radstock, Avon, according to the Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened to the mobile.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the mosque and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Voting in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the insulting and insulting tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a half-life held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the mosque and the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the charge of Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the "US saw Kavanaugh's skill, quality and courage".
"Voteing to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most successful lawyers of our day, a lawyer with an amazing history of public service," he told his followers from West Virginia.
The President made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't present myself, but it's a race," he said.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get big candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place not later than Friday, a high-ranking office of the Republican Party to the CNN was reported.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that rocked the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude earthquake 7.5.
"When yesterday was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they were victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) in Indonesia, in a press wheel in Yakarta.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone, pulled cars, trunks, houses, shook everything on the ground," Nugroho commented. The tsunami had moved by the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He added that some people had gone up to the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The air photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken bridges and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported in a communiqué that energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the city's geography, which sits on the edge of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and damage could be greater during the 300 km of the coast north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" by Donghala, Nugroho commented.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," the Red Cross said in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism not to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social networks, a man who was on the last floor of a building is heard warning people who were on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, taking up front buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great deal of silence that cut the communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with aid from Yakarta and other cities, the authorities declare, but the evacuated people still need food and other commodities.
The city airport has reopened for relief tasks only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims by Indonesia's tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff from Dongala have come safely and safely to the city of Palu, where employees are sheltered under a few floors installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while the aid groups launched disaster relief tools, some people complained that Palu was not allowing the displacement of cooperatives with extensive experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, only foreign personnel can be financed, provided that the site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As the Government says that it considers it a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not yet happened."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that brought some light to the dismal stories that wrote natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy came out of a canteen.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, an instructor of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had formed two of the missing paragliders for Asian Games, which ended earlier that same month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandadi, were his students.
"For my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours that followed the release of the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who participated in the festival that was held on the beach.
However, their messages showed only a mark of gray, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves take 26 750 USD during a reload of an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves attacked a Brink employee who recharged an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press note.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automatic casserole located in the leisure center and was preparing to reload it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "became running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about his or her identities should contact the Newport Police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Captain Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
It's been a long time since the 41-year-old West was named Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your appearance on Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new album, Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the program creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of this year while talking about the title of the album with the big boy radio speaker.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
It turned out to be Kanye, which means 'the only', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in capitals or minors, with or without script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, the troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the left student movements were accommodating throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed himself to providing support to young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to become involved in criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of I.A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should duplicate its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I. A.'s investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments then emerge from the announcements concerning I.A. of several parts of the United States Government, even when, in general, the United States lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 innovation in I A. by 2030.
"Dublining the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, since all the other countries are going very far behind the United States. We have a look at the next progress in the field of I.A.", Lee comments.
Double funding means double the possibility that the next major achievement in I.A. is achieved in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editorial Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of I. A. that won the best U.S. player in Othello. Later, he was executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized the previous American government's technological competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would enable the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to obtain government subsidies, Lee commented.
"It's not China that's leading academic leaders; they're corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired prominent people from universities to work at I. A.
Lee commented that changes in migration policy could also help the US to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I. A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China funds people from academic institutions as well as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to attract partners in the industrial and academic fields. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Foundation for Science, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in research by I. A.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonia's people decided in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name would change to "Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its accession candidate to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, most in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign questioned whether the participation would reach the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The paper of the referendum raised the following question: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name-change partners, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely in the European Union, because this is a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported one afternoon.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters deposited their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote at the Macedonia referendum on a change of name of the country that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and withdrew chairs from the campaign stores planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with a very high head, not by the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would make the investment that Macedonia needs so much, whose unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote was deposited.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute, it was ensured that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which meant a lower participation to the request.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, from Macedonia, revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the participation should be of 50 per cent more than one vote.
If it failed, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, skis all over Brighton's defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reiterated Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Aguero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the minute 65.
The Argentine midpoint received a passage in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before he entered the open field.
Once there, it was surrounded by four green shirts.
He failed to defend himself before going beyond several more on the edge of Brighton's area.
He took a walk to the left, where he was Sterling.
The English advance used his first touch in the area to return the balloon to Aguero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid the porter Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the network.
"Aguero has some problems on his foot," said Pep Guardiola, City coach, to journalists.
"We're talking about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you scored a goal at that time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the First League contest.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
In that game, Aguero received the balloon very much within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice balloon pass to the left for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some touch before heading to Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky blues forwarder threw the balloon into the network just before it left the border.
The city faces the Hoffenheim in a group party of the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to give the party to the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the content by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer expects to walk the mountain on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, triumphed before Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard post thanks to winning 5-2 on the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, we can at least walk the tire with the assurance that Denver's audience will be animated and that the other team will probably play the highest level I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would open the door number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's left history is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Semi-trailer Trump in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November everything we've done is at stake.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't present myself, but it's a race, so I'm going from one place to another fighting for big candidates," he said.
And he went on, "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all the means necessary, see the mixture, the evil.
They don't care who does harm or who has to pass over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen it these last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats were "serious, bad, horrible and false."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission appointing Senator Diane Feinstein, who received the abuses of the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect a response. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is already covering a wide range of opinions.
It's intolerant to people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was just surprised.
After all, I am the last of a row of Members of Parliament of the Labour Party who are told that it is not welcome, and just because we think it.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received a similar treatment categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in the field of national security, on Europe. It was ironic that matters in which Jeremy was in disagreement with previous leaders.
As indicated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy is already more than forgotten, if it really applied at some time.
It is increasingly clear that discriminatory views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party's leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect radically change his views and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a pattern of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues facing a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but they never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion "censorship" or each change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and that it would be so "good."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a secondary student, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my entire school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them, either as a councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to know my political positions or the areas in which I did not agree with the current leaders.
All I would say to those who promoted Friday's motion is that I do not understand these desires to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader when the country is headed by a Brexit that will affect public homes, businesses and services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting as I think it is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An Invited Ayr climbs up
Two trials at the end of the game may have decided to some extent the final outcome, but Ayr certainly deserved the victory in this entertaining party of the Tennant's Premiership day.
Now they're heading the table and it's the only inviolable team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to make better use of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be happy.
"We have been tested in all parties and we continue to be invited, so I have to rejoice," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: "The Air deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's trial in minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in front; but a yellow card to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan to the party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot got an unconverted trial.
Climo expanded the advantage of the Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of time, he marked and turned a trial into solitary, which left the marker in 17-5 in favour of the Ayr in the rest.
However, Melrose well started the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, to which they had to get on the hook, and when the party resumed, the Ayr progressed with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, Captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having another man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for plating Climo without the balloon, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a test when he was in the back of the evil that was going on.
Climo converted it, as he was doing since the party was almost resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent to the wing of Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the fifth test of the premises.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to guide his career to the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restaurant sector after revealing that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his fellow comedy for many years, Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "floorish restoration market" of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": a landless Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Marines watch a shipyard in La Paz.
In public buildings there are sea blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazons, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Getting it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict with the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to reinvigorate the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a resolution of the International Court of Justice for one October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the outcome of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will speak in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will have the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who frees a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice resolution only arrives six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been delayed in the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that the belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any remaining Chilean good will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not been exchanging ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime theme as a political crusade.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless I can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Nordic Foreign Minister, says his nation will never be the first to bring nuclear disarmament to an end if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues that have paralysed more than three months after this summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration ending with the Korean War to surrender to the North is a "quimera".
Washington is wary of accepting the statement without first making any significant disarmament movement.
Both Kim and U.S. president Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers to be the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the mandaters.
The fashion shows in Paris reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, don't look any more.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's designers presented a set of large-sized excentric hats for their summer summer 2019 collection in the gateway, revealing the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide, embroidered wing with feathers that involved the heads of the models.
Other large-size supplements were sandals with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pin, but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter of more than the high sewing.
One creation reminded a complete, snorkel and included glasses, while the other looked like a frozen cone.
If you like the big-size fashion, you're lucky.
The style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to appear on the streets of the shops.
The big hats come walking hard from the "La Bomba" hand with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this so little practical hat that it flooded the social networks presented another great creation in the gateway: a pajamas bag as large as the model in the bathroom that carried it.
The dark orange riffin bag, decorated with raffin arrows and with a white leather strap, was the main piece of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season in the Week of the Fashion of Paris.
As the stylist of famous Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "In the next summer, I hope to see huge umbrellas and beach bags on the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale supplements."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to the world's citizens
The independent educational centres in Scotland have a career of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the examinations that are reinforced by individual and collective success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Independent Colleges Council (SCIS, for their English stamps), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent colleges aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted study plan, modern languages remain a popular and desired assignment in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message reaches his head.
If you speak your language, it will reach your heart."
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries, you cannot depend solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's examinations, we can see that the languages are at the highest of the classification tables, with higher approval rates in independent colleges.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest score.
The data collected from the 74 centres forming part of the SCIS showed that 72% of the students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of the German students, 69% of the French students and 63% of the Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent colleges in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages are considered to be at the same level as CTIM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the United Kingdom Employment and Competence Commission revealed that, for reasons given by entrepreneurs about the difficulties encountered in covering jobs, 17 % were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that someone chooses, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last all your life.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to advance automatically to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language as well as to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If you know a number of languages, especially those in developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each college will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent colleges you can always choose from several languages provided by teaching staff specialized in this matter.
Independent education centres in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the necessary skills to succeed, whatever the future for them.
At this point, it is undisputed that, in a global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "competence for international communication".
Independent colleges will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Colleges Council
LeBron starts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James begin their first match with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening party of the early Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes you're going to play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton commented on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on a tweet that was probably James playing a few minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked by his plans for the pre-time program of six Lakers parties.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-time parties to prepare," he said.
Trump's half-time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump launches a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of his candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court pending, Trump seeks support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's half in West Virginia tonight and how can you see online?
Trump's mine in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can view it online via a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the appearances of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who have been charged with improper sexual conduct and have been awaiting an early confirmation vote of the Senate for a week as much as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans who face November's elections to take the lead.
Thus, President Trump's campaign pointed out that the five minutes of the next week were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans were trying to protect and expand the majority who remained in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign," Reuters told a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to give his name.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena Stadium in Wheeling this evening's half could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as to have coverage in the Pittsburgh media", as West Virginia Metro News reported.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is being dismissed in the polls.
"For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president must come to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows that it dares to fight to keep the hope alive to the individual games on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a fully invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they're taking us four, so I guess that can be considered a little impulse," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points forward with twelve more in play.
As Speeth points out, Americans feel that they have some wind in favor and reasons to be animated, among other reasons, by the couple formed by Speeth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Speeth has been lethal from tea to green and preach with the example.
The gutural shouts of celebration rose by volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to embalmed the fourth party when he and Thomas went down two after two holes.
The putt that the party gave them on the 15th was received with a similar shout, from those who reported that they believed that the American team had not yet left.
"What needs to be done to redouble efforts and concentrate on the party," Spieth commented.
That's what these players have done.
18 days to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe has four of them and nothing can get them out of it.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, but also the crazys avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine days of Friday morning.
That rara and the way its energy flows with the bulimic public make it clear that these are the players to win on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets in Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it remains premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson disembarked Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four balls in the morning, after forming a partner with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried in Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they could not get out.
But Sunday there will be no kind of help getting out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them close because they appreciate the interactions between couples, advice that they give and that they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in a moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and brings a great advantage to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe progresses by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe goes with a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and the foursomes with a result of 10-6 on the United States.
The motivated duo composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in the auras, advancing four points in the Le Golf National classification.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning's fourballs, which ended 3-1.
U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but could not cut short distances.
U.S. Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual Sunday parties to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the apox of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, his magnificent union served to beat a discouraged Woods and American novel Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, who had not been very prominent on both Saturdays, had occasional moments of brilliantness, but now has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the fourballs in the morning, was again the partner of Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three from the world respectively, with a result of 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwestern Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three winning times, Jordan Speeth, and Justin Thomas served as reference to the Americans, getting two points on Saturday.
They won a passionate victory 2-1 in front of Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initial holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a difference of four points in the individual games has only happened on two occasions, although Furyk, as the owner of the trophy, only needs a patch to preserve it.
Although it has been the best seconds for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" that they are first disarmed unilaterally if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his mistrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong declared it before the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had adopted "significant measures of good will" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, disarming nuclear testing facilities and commiting itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will unarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a "by-phase" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, its statement is important, since it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without any more, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed North Korea security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first renounce his nuclear weapon.
Washington has also resisted appeals to mitigate international sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose coercively, even objecting to a declaration of end of war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a picture of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri made no mention of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the United Nations leader in the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea leader, in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the interested part in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in a similar stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to lead North Korea's missiles to the U.S. soil after the "major president" Trump, in a suicide mission, was called Kim "a rocket man".
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advance of disarmament, but said that there was still much to be done and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, like the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of the Security Council sanctions must continue to be vigorous and non-compliance until we realize the final and fully verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo spoke to Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again the month he came to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He went from Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea reported that his "needs were those of a mafior."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "relevant measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
Thanks to a new course this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing masquerade culture to study all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, it is believed that the first of his class in the United States.
His motivation to launch the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she had just learned about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of the dream, which surprised me," he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, pointed out that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students were only asleep during the week.
The course of one hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of the lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, an icon of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it's not going to change the behavior of the students right now.
However, we believe they have the right to know, as anyone has the right to know the effects on tobacco smoking health," added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride by "passing the night on a candle" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good-quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a hunger feeling, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year in Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the whole campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students think about putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emits the screens of the electric appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having problems staying asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal falls to men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the house, when the Dolly Menga attack destroyed Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
Those from Ibrox wanted to win their first victory out of the house since the 4-1th of February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving their team at eight points of the Hearts, leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack occurred seven minutes before the middle of time and the little inspired alignment of the Rangers was at no time.
Now, the Rangers go down to sixth position, Livingstone goes up to third, behind the Hibernian for the difference of goals.
The Rangers may encounter more problems, as the Calum Spence line judge had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly launched an object from the visiting background.
Gerard changed eight of the holders who won the match against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scotland League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 liveston players who started a point to the Hearts last week and would have rejoiced at the way his very organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have marked the two minutes from the beginning, when Menga took a walk into the space for Scott Pittman who went between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the mediocampist sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs took a deep loss for Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in the defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send it out for the long pole.
The Rangers recovered control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the party, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson made deaf to the Colombian request.
The Rangers got two shots to the gate in the first half, but the old porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was only seen in trouble to deal with the head of Lassana Coulibally and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked in minute 34 by Livingstone came against all prognosis, no one can deny that they deserved it because of the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers did not intend to face a deep game at Jacobs' stop ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to mark the goal.
In the rest, Gerrard replaced Coulibally by Ryan Kent, which had a almost immediate impact, as the driver passed it to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block him.
Even so, Livingstone continued to take the visitors exactly to the type of game she likes, with Lithgov and Halkett clearing a long walk after another.
Holt's men could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head corner that didn't come in.
The Rangers' substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty to the end of the match after a meeting with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked elsewhere.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as Geiger counter.
The storyteller Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Crown Campaigns", with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of vacuaries scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
At the tip of the earpieces, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
So, they can "see" a common protein to many cancers and reinstate them.
A vaccine test is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking patient immune cells and "teach them" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West boarded on a diatrobe for Trump with a MAGA cap after its appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was quoted in the study of Saturday Night Live after a wrong performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented to the 2020 elections.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the cover with the message Make America Great Again, he began to despot against the Democrats and repeat his support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone white and wonder how I can like Trump if he's a racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have gone from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL launched Matt Damon's program with sketches in which Hollywood star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he was not retransmitted, Como Chris Rock went up the recording of the West Bronze to social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that it had been wrong among the builders to wear that hat.
"They went with me.
They told me not to go out with the hat on.
They're with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see what sleep I am?" and added that "I was going to put on my superman's coat, because that meant that no one could tell you what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments received public abuses on at least two occasions and SNL members seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study remained completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many when he went out to the stage to sing I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GRAIES TO RESIST TO THE MUCHEDUMBRE".
Karen Hunter, presenter of an interview program, tweeted that West was just "being himself and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I decided not to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes, or supporting his art) who I think is hugging and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed, saying it was now "the person previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Murder attempt charge for stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday in the Judge of Belfast's First Instance.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Throne Game star, attack on toxic maleity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Nieve in the violent series of medieval fantasy of the HBO, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that these screen roles often transmitted to young boys who had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married her partner in the Tronos Game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt "very important" to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems to me quite important at this moment, where have we made mistakes with masculinity?" he commented.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television may have a share of responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, which makes young people feel they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Tronos Game prequela or sequela when the series ends next summer, claiming that he is "a harp of battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will stage True West, Sam Shepard's theatrical work that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Before long, the actor revealed that he believes that knowing his wife Rose is the best that has taken out of the Throne Game.
"I met my wife in the series, so in that sense she gave me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic series won with Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at a family farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more recent cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 affected persons in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which entails a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced in all its practices, the Chinese health authorities declared at a convention in Yunnan Province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sexual means is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was deplored in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffers from much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff will filter data from senators of the Republican Party and ensure that it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters criticised on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published the personal data of three U.S. senators of the Republican Party on the Wikipedia page on legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that these accusations were driven by commentators and "extreme right" websites.
"Truths, lies, and more vile lies," Waters commented on a Twitter post.
The information published included addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person of the Chapter published information on the Internet during a meeting of the Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration was performed at some point after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Chapter.
"This unsubstantiated charge is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these false and false accusations, was for nothing responsible for the filtering of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement provoked immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"Design this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it is not the temple necessary to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
You mustn't rebel.
He must not question the accused's motives.
You must keep calm and serene."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction to the criticisms of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of feeling too angry during Thursday's presence.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to strip Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the relevant authorities and entities responsible for the enforcement of the law of these false accusations".
"We will make sure the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all my staff members."
Review by Johnny English: Again in action. Rowan Atkinson's spy parody is cut short
Now it has become a tradition to look for guides to Brexit in any new movie with a British approach. It seems this is what it is to do with this new delivery of the parishioner's action and comedy Johnny English, who started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this self-satisfied ironic about how clearly disbanded we are the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes and inexpressive face, has renewed his license to put the foot for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comical creation designed for non-English speaking film territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to shed glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a piece of that kind who played a single note on the topic of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious travel and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, sowing chaos after him.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good times.
I loved to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor while the helicopters were crashing against the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but humor remains fairly short and is surprisingly superfluous, especially now that "series" films such as 007 and Mission impossible add comical ingredients without problems.
humour seems more directed to children than adults, and for me, the absurd disadvantages of Johnny English are not as naive and accurate as Atkinson's silent jokes in Mr Bean's role.
Now, the repeated argument of the present is that Britain is in serious problems.
A computer pirate has been infiltrated into the supersecret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all his agents active before the consternation of the agent in service, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pumpy and accoral character who is seeing how his political popularity sinks: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room for work.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as all active spies are at risk, you will have to resort to anyone who is withdrawn.
This has to be the Johnny English torpedoes, which now teaches in a poor college, although it gives extra-official classes about how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spying academy similar to that of the Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his former companion Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice paper for which Vicki Pepperdine is not used enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous traps of a multimillionaire charismatic technology world that claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odise of absurd situations: they dress up of comrades, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, they strip off the chaos hiding in Volta's luxurious yacht; and English becomes pure anarchy when trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
Definitely, they were used in depth in this last sequence, but, because of very graceful and strict as it is, the whole continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A pretty regular product.
Like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make true justice his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but covers five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think about a radical plan with which British would work four days a week, but would charge five.
It is assumed that the party wants the owners of the companies to allocate the savings obtained through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same wage.
According to the sources, the idea of "cashing" into the plans and the party's economic agenda to incline the country towards workers is indicated.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to withdraw from the changing economy.
As a high official of the Labor Party, The Sunday Times commented: A revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be one day for another, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter the party expects to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
One spokesperson for the workers said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this moment."
The minister of Hacienda in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the conference of the Labour Party that was held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "exploited" by companies providing public services.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies do not fully recover their participation, as a laborist government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in corporate management councils and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of private sector enterprises' shares are allocated to employees, which would amount to an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 minutes" about FBI research around Kavanaugh and if I could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has held at least one week's final vote for his confirmation as a judge of the Supreme Court and also raises the question as to whether the outcome could affect any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be held on Sunday, the journalist of "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham are talking about whether the FBI could bring in information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, and the claim came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolute, stubborn."
Graham's vote, however, seems unbearable.
"I already have a decision taken around Brett Kavanaugh and I'd drop the charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett firmly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she appoints has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star poster is gathered for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people move to the Great Lawn of the Central Park to enjoy activities such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be aware of the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", as volunteers, send e-mails to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to take measures or not more than a form of so-called "clitivism", which is called the stance that we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its partners in favour of a large number of different objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved that world leaders will announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments are "The Power of Nutrition", an association of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom combined with the joint commitment to "help children grow and develop with all their potential". To this end, Rwanda has been proposed to provide $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and collaborators of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small hit in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken to try to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard path and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But as we have already achieved the human rights movements and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the events we will have at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Army to carry out the blocking of Russian energy exports - Secretariat of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington could use his Army to prevent Russian energy from disrupting the markets, including that of the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates in the legitimate government, is no more than a pretext for expansion in new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the most supplier in southern Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Armed Forces, has the ability to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, by the way, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they were actually the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to use and replace fuels," he warned while pointing out that Russia can only do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its natural gas to Europe and lift its role to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a Moscow reindeer.
Moscow has at any time insisted that the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project only responds to economic reasons and is a more unfair display of competition.
"I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy, last September in Moscow.
The US position, however, has been found with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization leading the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a meeting recently held between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyse the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate for the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would study the possibility of joining the presidential race after the elections to half a term.
During a meeting in the town of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to change our broken government and finally have women among the leaders," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting myself as a candidate for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Town Hall and stated that "he was taking the country along the wrong path".
"I'm really worried about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke unscrupulously about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote".
A survey was published on Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe it should be submitted for the 2020 elections.
A 58% of Massachusetts' "possible" voters claimed that the senator should not be present, according to a survey by Suffolk Political University Research Center/Boston Globe.
However, 32 % of the respondents supported their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible nomination for 2020 of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, as the Associated Press agency reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin in a half of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"The situation that my son is experiencing, for all that has happened since he came back, is well known to the other families who suffer the effects of the TPT and other injuries that our soldiers are returning with," said the public who gathered in a half in favour of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo of which no one wants to speak, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "live with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is such respect for what their soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to his country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, who interfered with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of getting a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Colombia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter in Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum-seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant has not been revealed in the case "Grace v. Sessions" which presented in August the EU Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
He said his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but US officials refused his asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers who represent these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, such as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy withdrew a 2014 decision that the Migration Appeals Board (IAB) made by undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday, stating that the new policy " ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must fail under the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, on the contrary, this exception violates that principle," is indicated in the friend curiae.
In addition, lawyers indicated in writing that the policy that denies entry to immigrants damages the US economy by claiming that they usually become entrepreneurs more frequently and "supposes a necessary hand of work".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin may apply for asylum for reasons of persecution or threats of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a particular political opinion," Sessions said when they announced this Directive on 11 June last.
The asylum has never been created as a measure to address all the problems, not even all the serious problems, facing every day people around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths increases in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us while trying to comfort her baby with fever in a evacuating center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute they get ambulances with more bodies.
And water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to retrace the few properties they have left behind in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, also damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are being swept away.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had the back and a broken shoulder, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building because of the constant replicas, also very strong.
He couldn't help but cry when he told us the violent earthquake he lived while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
He was trapped in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China's Daily payment supplement in The Moines Register, Iowa's most sold newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to join the US Congress on 6 November, something that China roundly denies.
The accusation that Trump launched on Beijing's attempt to influence US elections marked what US officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their business activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports by both sides.
The Chinese countervailing tariffs that applied to the beginning of the trade war were thought to return to state exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of China's main exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, China "is still intensifying that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
"In order to try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press when trying to publish a payment ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the kiosk of the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few discriminating voices and no real reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have on the worrying trajectory that is taking over the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant journals ignored the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which journal it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are being distanced from women before the mid-legislative vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many renowned Republicans are closing ranks in favour of the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a return, especially by women, may occur in the next half-legislative votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed their desire to proceed with the vote.
"In this kind of matter it is not possible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School at the University of Siracusa, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher argued that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to take a stand for the FBI's investigation was sufficient to calm the disillusioned voters on this issue.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman of the Progressist Group MoveOn, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators who gathered at the Senate's doors enchanted "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) at the time when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats comes from all the prognosis," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say that impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive women from outside neighborhoods and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who do not usually vote even though they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he had all the details of his allegations of sexual abuse against the candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts indicated that there could be a reversal if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This matter has become a major issue for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only a question of the committee's vote or the final vote, not even if they are sitting in the bank in Kavanaugh; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, United States Priorities Director (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although they are a few more who stand on their side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov indicates that 41% of respondents make the testimony of Ford definitively or likelyly, while 35% claim to believe definitively or likelyly in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that he thought that Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same for Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified on oath before the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her by drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company based on the Berners-Lee Open Code Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
You can include lists, lists of pending tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive in storing personal data online is that the user is who decides completely who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal training through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach the whole world.
At the moment, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technological developers from around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not you're going to introduce a radical change where all your business models are completely modified from one day to another.
"We're not going to ask permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Despite being launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Clerk Who Winned a Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later, and I never knew that he had been granted the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone and a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "passing through a fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "higher courage", made the line advance before reaching a cannon with one hand and drop to three of the pitch.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann killed him by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions he carried out his grandfather were "so great that I could never reach his height, but they were very exciting".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the show, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was all a privilege for him to be part of the show" and added that "the value of an authentic hero is patented when he is shown such a large support."
MMA's followers were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay awake all night to see the whole Bellator 206 so that they won't let you see the main event at the end.
The San José cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, the viewers of the United Kingdom became tense when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having had to stay awake until the first hour of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated drawings as "a heavy joke".
"There is a government regulation regulating the content issued from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Marketing and Communication Vice-President Bellator, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Peppa la cerdita", yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they are going to modify the program to include British spectators in the next editions.
"When I think about the transmission option, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, exactly.
We're trying to fix it, because at first we think it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise the next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are what we have usually done. We try to offer more than usual so that the lovers are happy and we pass.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumpher.
At his age 24, he told us that he didn't realize until he came to high school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first program of Desert Island Radio Discs 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to other people.
He also told us that he had become a father, that he had begun to be important in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mystical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months because of illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, which was shown to be a marginal, commented that he felt "low" to the rest during his childhood, because "he didn't socially accept that you liked children and girls".
He said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he was not disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games of this year's Australia to claim that more countries display homosexuality.
He said he told him because he was happy to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to convey that "hope" to others.
The world's three-time champion said it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the winner of an Oscar last year, who has been 20 years old, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so young" (was his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same high and low as you.
The couple had a son in June who they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have turned around to 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, of course, Robbie."
His son is called his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the passes to London in 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I wasn't able to tell you that I wasn't going to be in the first row," he said.
"He had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that exact moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that time I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of me in some Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Heather Small Proud, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still wearing chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed at the bank on the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad hit.
Mickelson, who played at the event every two years to get a record for the 12th time, was released by Captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as many times it has done for the United States, the five-time champion of major tournaments had to conform with encouragement in some moments and, in others, try to perfect their game in the field and thus be able to correct what afflicts him.
Never the directest driver, not even at the highest moment of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in its best form for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough is constantly punishing with wrong hits.
And, if the field is no longer sufficiently depressing, Mikkelson, on Sunday's ninth game, faces the brilliant British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debut Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games that have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below at the beginning of the 12 individual parties, started out in an impressive way, Mickelson's party could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his companion, he couldn't say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he had today, gave me a palm in his back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
It is in the Famous Hall and has brought a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't think of him playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it got out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand from more Ryder Cup games.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cups trajectory that had never so clearly equaled the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 lost and 7 equal, although Furyk said his presence brought many more untenable values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to joke about others; it's great to have it on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players have loved to have it as support, too this week; it was fun.
It brings much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the Captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, where a band led by Sve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end only managed to end the other by climbing the heels at a minimum margin, winning 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"Don't stop remembering that we made a big tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brooklyn and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but very little," said Bjorn, portraitd, after seeing the generation of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History will teach us to me and to everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all morning.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, that is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no less, than the best players in the world."
proud of what their players have done in a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you test all your abilities as a golfer.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of one morning.
Now it's time to leave your partner one side, go and get the best out of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as partners, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
The same Furyk has been at both extremes in the last days of those great tournaments and has been part of the team he won in Brooklyn and then ended up losing when Europe took the "Millar of Medina".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, suspended again
The new German Navy fleet should have been in charge in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least the year that comes due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship which heads the new fractures of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery delayed the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen fleets.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bullet missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as very low radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the ongoing delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power at sea) to be old when they begin to provide service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 broke up with owners last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff in the former Bremen class fractures.
It was also found that the ship had an excessive burden, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonning Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as other similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the whole project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed that it has reached €31 billion ($36 billion), instead of the €2200 million initial.
The problems associated with the new fractures are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of the ship power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Army is "remaining without ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that the problem had been getting worse over time, because old ships were given low, but had not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fractures could have joined the Navy.
The National Trust spys on the secret life of the martyrs
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, is trying to find out how the moustaches use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything is expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and to help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano murals, as well as the Daubenton river murals and long-eared browns of the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS template and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
The experts will analyze the sounds gathered in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species they do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results reveal what habitat areas are most important for muselagos and how they are used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests for bats and other associated species should be maintained.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been considerably reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cables can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cats.
The moustaches aren't really blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates hormones and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the subject of murals very seriously.
He has ten experts trained in the field, who are dedicated to conducting regular surveys, nest inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to Scottish bats in the state of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the proper habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about moustaches, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the property, as an involuntary colony of cattle can be destroyed and 400 females and cattle could be killed, which would mean the destruction of a whole local population.
Murciélagos are protected and it is illegal to kill them, slaughter them or torture them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Conservation Trust officer, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers are pursuing the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has catalogued allegations of rape as "face news", and says that people "want to get to know" at the expense of their name.
His lawyers have been instructed to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
In front of Portugal and Youth, she is accused of rapeing a American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
She was accused of paying her $375 000 to hide the incident, as Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With a video from Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, took the report as "face news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball looking at the camera.
"They only want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same story all the time.
They want to be famous just to mention me, but that's right, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a claim to Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will try to obtain compensation for "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years".
It seems that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly violated it annually, according to documents registered in the Clark County Court.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo was horrified after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had been cheated on by that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was allowed to.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they photographed the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she had "terror to the reprisals" and concerned her "to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is trying to cancel the agreement, since she is still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to Juve, a big Italian football for a 100 million € contract.
Brexit: the United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent its whole life" if it lost its position as world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, said the Secretary of Industry Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK would communicate to the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby, would be temporarily stopped.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of delays in customs duties in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to loss of work.
The plant of Burnaston, which manufactures Auris and Avensis models from Toyota, produced around 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production partners in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement, especially with regard to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns raised by car manufacturers revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
The production line of Toyota is based on the adjusted production mode (‘just in time’) or at the latest, where the pieces come every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture charge cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, an interruption could occur at the border which, according to the sector, could result in delays and dissipation of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than one day of inventory in its plant in Derbyshire, the company said and, in that case, production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "acquired precisely to avoid such controls at border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we need to take advantage of the opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today program 4.
"Toyota's evidence, among other things many manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a set of extremely successful supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union on the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these works are lost, they will never recover."
A government spokesman said, "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that limits our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "send another week", as he continued the debate on the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump's and Russia's aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation ahead whether Trump decides to fire the general prosecutor or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fueled Washington's knives for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself carried to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, among the news where he said he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (which was then in the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said "I would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, could be this week or could be postponed another, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We're going to decide on the move and I'm going to inform the press, as I usually do."
Some journalists would protest this claim: Sanders has not conducted any press rounds in the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists who were acting on a large-scale basis, although he said, "I did not disagree with the fact that they fanfarroned".
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, while quoting without evidence: "We have contrasted these numbers."
The press wheels will continue to be realized, Sanders said, but "If the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it's much better than doing it to me.
We've tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press wheel when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press calls with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only occur on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president showed why it was so, where he made a rash appearance and, at times, bizarrely, in front of the journalists who were gathered there.
The Secretary of State of Health writes to EU workers from NHS Scotland about their fears in Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has written to the EU template that works in Scotland's HSS to express the country's gratitude and its desire to follow them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that do not depend on central power.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit in which it was chosen to take the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations around a possible stage in which there would be no agreement.
I know that all of this must be very confusing to you.
And it is therefore that I should now like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is, without any doubt, your home and we would love to continue telling you."
Christian Abercrombie is operating urgently after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, was surgically intervened after having suffered a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"I came to the band and it exploded right there," said Reed.
Both the trainers and the medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie in the band line before putting it on a hook and taking it to the bottom of it.
A member of the Tennessee State template told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in its first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five pickles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.

Foreigners will be subject to a higher transfer tax when they purchase property in the United Kingdom and the extra money that is collected by this measure will be used to cover the "without ceiling", according to the new plans of conservators
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the tax on the transfer of funds will be imposed on those persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £ 120 million per year to the "no ceiling"
The additional money that is collected with the increase in the transfer tax of funds to foreign property buyers in the United Kingdom will be destined for aid to the "uncovered", Theresa May announced today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and more generous voters.
The increase in money transmission tax will be recorded for people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and that money will be aimed at encouraging government policy to combat the problem of fraud in the streets.
The charge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand dwellings and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £ 120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, causing price increases and making it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's most populated areas (in particular, capital) have become "phantom cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping very high prices in the properties by secretly buying land without intention of using it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas applicable to affordable housing to solve the "glorious housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of empty evictions.
It also proposes to grant the local authorities more power to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position to the Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy housing more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to direct Scotland"
Sunderland coach says his "priority goal" is becoming a coach in Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is illustrated by the possibility of revitalizing the Northeast club, which currently holds the third position in the League One (the third league division of England), at three points from the first.
He went to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister's last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," Ross told Sportssound at the BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he's always done that he wants to come back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage a club successfully."
Among Ross' predecessors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he went to such names set up in such a big club after rejecting Barnsley's proposals and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me is measured according to whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond undoubtedly to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can return to the club where it has to be."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after being an assistant in Dumbarton and for a period of 15 months in the technical body of the Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren pass by on the edge of the descent to win the championship in the next season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably an actual crossroads," he recalled in reference to when the Alloa was charged.
"I always thought the direction was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It could sound strange, because it was good, I could win my life very well with it and enjoy some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train, and now I have managed to do it, is the time of my adult life in which I felt better, no doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 a.m. on Saturday
The heat wave of the summer has boosted profits in the British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the restaurants chains.
The pubs and bars groups saw how their sales increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while the profits of the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of the consulting for CGA companies, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England continues in the world have still made that the pattern of the previous month of June is maintained in July, in which the pubs increased by 2.8% their profits, although the restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8% in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly food also suffered with heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the managed bars and pubs, the sales of drinks rose to 6,6 per cent during the month, while the meals dropped by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, of RSM's host and leisure analysts, said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sports events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the business market outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the drop of 4.8% in sales compared to last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the constant cost pressures.
The long and warm summer could not have come at the worst time for gastronomic operators and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand implantations.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the United Kingdom restaurants, bars and pubs, the performance data of 47 operating groups are collected and analysed, with a combined invoice of more than £9000 million and is the market reference value.
One out of every five children have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents
One of every five children (some even 11 years old) have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents and teachers, as a survey revealed
The survey, conducted by 20,000 secondary students, revealed a growth in the fake Instagram pages
The news has deepened the fear of publication of sexual content
About 20% of students claimed to have a "principal" account showing their parents
One out of every five children (some even 11 years of age) create accounts on social networks that hide adults.
A survey conducted at 20,000 secondary students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in Instagram's false accounts, a reference site to share photos.
The news has exacerbated the fear that sexual content will be published.
About 20% of students said they had a healthy "principal" account showing their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who accidentally met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violar me".
The research conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent colleges found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create Internet spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Academy of Athletics Directive
Elid Doyle has been elected to be part of the Scottish Federation of Athletics Directive as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning athlete on the track and field in Scotland and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim that the sport will benefit from their great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid is recognized and respected in the entire community of athleticism in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland will benefit greatly from its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I like to be the coach of athletes and hope to be able to bring things and help develop sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the four gold he won and is now a usual expert at the BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would do it.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The ad of the sacaleches where compared to mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A company of sacaleches has divided public opinion over the Internet with an ad where it compares to mothers who breast-feed the cows they order.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "first silent sacaleches of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired in a video with some ironic music where it is shown to mothers who have the freedom that gives them the new milk extractor.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay in a dance track, along with some cows, with words like, "Yes, I order myself alone, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed it, they're not holes, they're my chests."
The choir continues to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, order my women."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it is possible to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to place cows to advertise this product.
Like us, you have to be pregnant before giving birth so that you can produce milk, except that they are taken away from their babies days after they stop," one person wrote.
The milk extractor Elvie is discreetly adapted to a lactating subject (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Trumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a milk extractor to mothers that they do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "Go to a more debriefed ad."
However, other people defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted that the song was "degenerative".
"I think it's a great idea.
If she's still breast-feeding, I'm sure she'll have one.
By using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little dedicated, but I don't give it back.
It's a product genius," a woman told us.
Another person said to us, "It's a funny announcement addressed to mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The ad is neither praised nor judged by the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed within the subjects.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take out the milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly connected within the breast-fed infant, making it possible for its users to move, subject to their babies, and even go out the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, tells us: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it was worth a daring and challenging launch.
By showing parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended to do was to draw attention to the use of infants' bombs and their challenges, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new bomb offers in an entertaining way.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children shot through the doorway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minor immigrants discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of juveniles detained has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly flow at the border has been practically maintained at the usual levels, partly because of the rhetorical hardness and the policies introduced by Trump administration are complicated by the possibility of abundling these children.
Traditionally, most of the fathers, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that the fact of proposing to take a child would put their own lives in danger in the country.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential employers and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Office of Immigration and Customs, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to abdicate unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed that after 70 per cent of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of the sponsors or their families are illegally located in the country, and most of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people," Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute the underprivileged minors, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum period of one month from the detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers of the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered fit for the camp shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers of the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent seizures or attempts to flee.
According to defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to their size, signs of ill-treatment in these children are overlooked.
Moreover, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could lead to a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria requests the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Mouleem, also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country's war being met in their eighth year.
Mouleem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally located in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the topic "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "combating in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for returning and blaming "some Western countries" for "seeing irrational fears" were given to the refugee decision to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel base of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had "clear spaces" and has expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (connected to Al-Qaeda), who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy from the United Nations, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and opposition to write a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win the reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will probably expect, a resignation or a scandal will soon end its presidency.
This would be without a doubt "The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
There are currently no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the peak attendance rates have doubled to CNN 1.05 million and have tripled to MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC has exceeded cable channels indexes with 3.5 million viewers for the main night news programs.
"It is a strange attraction that we have not yet been able to understand," says Neal Baer, producer of "Designed Survivor", a dramatic series of ABC on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip he made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? He asked her.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer that Scovell received.
Chaos is always up in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families could meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that can only allow the most privileged spectators.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize you're taking six hours by seeing a panel of experts discussing the use of the sources of "deep background" used by Bob Woodward for his book "Fare", Paul Manafort's leather hunter ($5,000), "a piece of unscrupulous pride", in the words of The Washington Post, and the implications of the scrupulous descriptions of Stormy Daniels of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"In offering something new every night, it's part of what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", when he talks to us about the alternate show of Trump and his daily performances of the plot (either going into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).

When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, I had a sunny day of 27 degrees on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was safe inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get rid of the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in those days and people told us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss says.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows in the most adjusted half-term election of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the flow of money is reaching the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same trade.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The career for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest for the campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (NCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That step had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support to China, although after its failure
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican and Panamanian Republic had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a pleasant meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners separated from the Trump Management Team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to return to the heads of the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the " recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a communiqué this month.
But it was only decided to punish El Salvador, which had already received some 140 million US dollars in 2017 for, among other things, control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain purposes, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which ended any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence plans to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if diplomatic, is seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three American envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the status of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
The Study of History
The next planned step could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's justice, which already has considerable evidence in the public register.
It is thought that Mueller is also taking this research into the possibility that Trump's campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be given accounts before that chamber, just when he is prepared to present himself again to the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional, and I do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the content.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to give a coup d'état against Hitler. It was only necessary that the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflexion, and the inexorable march of democracy speeds up or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these inflexion points.
What would we do if Trump fired General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been seen in a good place since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested to record the president in secret and speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the explanation of The Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it confirms its position in the Supreme Court despite the credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will report to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will encounter a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
He managed to survive, he emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to burn the candles of the Sabbath on the same table decorated with a sponge.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic in front of the Rapid Vienna meeting
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against the Villareal in early months, will put them in a strong position to be classified in the G Group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented mid-campus Graham Dorrans from reaching its first appearance from the season until the 2-2 match against the Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a trampoline for larger things.
"We got a good score, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the party believing we could get something and go out with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved victory at the end, but generally the empathy was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out for everyone and we were the best team.
We will have another big European night this Thursday.
I hope that we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult party because they have already achieved a good result in the previous party, but I am sure that we will be able to move forward and achieve a positive result, with all the support of the public.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now a general environment is noticed that everything will work out well.
The team is good, the boys are enjoying a lot and we're having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it to their relatives.
Around half of the people who participated in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this.
"People want a family to take care of them, but they're not taking steps to have this conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes with sufficient anticipation.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determinant of the cost.
It incorporates into the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help you cover your expenses or to secure yourself with your own savings, provided that you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: advance the legal battles.
Be responsible for obtaining a power of medical care to designate a trusted person to monitor his medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with their own wishes if they cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a notarial power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his or her behalf and make sure that your invoices are paid if they are incapacitated.
Don't forget about the little details: imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write all these details in a written plan for you to always be ready.
"Are not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors should treat?" asked Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned."
Shooting a man several times with a carbine in Ilfracombe
They shot a man with a carbine several times as he walked home after going out at night.
The victim, a man about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he received shots in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
Its injuries are not fatal and the police have called for possible witnesses.
Teremotes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
With blocked communications, assistance officers have not been able to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a regent that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coast on the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they focus mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck west of Dongala in 1996, with nine fatal victims.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Centre, a large zone of seismic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
There were hundreds of dead victims on the island of Nias, opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake devastated south Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatal victims.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.

The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested by charges of aggression.
Palin, aged 29 and a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he removed the phone.
Palin has been sentenced to pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with an unsecured loan of $500, KTUU reported.
The court was brought before the court on Saturday, where it was declared "finally innocent" when its statement was requested, informed the chain.
Palin faces three minor offences of Class A, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor offence of Class B, with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin are brought.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, interference with the complaint of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a state-of-the-art drunk weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had said he had a fist on his face.
Several veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude of 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, located in the north-east of Yakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike attack last October on the West Side highway of Bajo Manhattan, striking down the pedestrians and cyclists he was on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of the intention to request a death penalty, presented in the South District of New York.
The two charges entail a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury filed a charge to Saipov with 22 charges including eight counts of murder with organized crime, which are often used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to prosecutors, who described the way in which Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and devious".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York processed a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a New York federal case was in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were sentenced by conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed his lack of remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by videos of ISIS on his phone.
She also asked for the ISIS flag to be removed in her hospital room, the police said.
It has been declared not guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a declaration of guilt with a sentence of eternal chains without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously requested prosecutors who would not claim the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said the politicians had to "smooth the heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham concentration that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" if Farage had been the secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May in reconciling his divided ranks has been further highlighted when a group of Tories for the sake of permanence have joined an opposition protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitment plan that was signed in Chequers in the midst of the attacks of the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
MEP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been held responsible in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already left," he said.
This Member of Parliament by Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to serve them.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and we want to remain in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the concentration, where he told reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public in general does not like Chequers' plan, the opposition will not vote in favour and it is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going out the streets and voting first.
Forget Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime ministers keep their positions when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that they would have to "smooth the heat" to the politicians if they saw that they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them out of their way."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are going to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the proponents of the Permanence travelled the streets of Birmingham before half an hour in the city center.
Some activists called on Tories Against Brexit's billboards after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis was angry with the conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's implementation during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of being present for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "he will consider all possibilities of presenting himself to the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the November re-election against Geoff Diehl, the Republican State Representative, who was co-chair of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
Much has been speculated about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with the voters using the municipal format since Trump assumed the position.
One of his assistants asked him if he was going to present himself for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington to settle our irregular government, and that includes having a woman on top."
Arrested by the murder of LSU Sims player firearms
Baton Rouge (Luisiana) police announced this Saturday that a suspect was arrested for killing Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who is seen in the video.
Yes, from 20 years of age, he was shot near the Southern University campus in the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head that finally caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247 sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got a shot at Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been on the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Yes, a player from Baton Rouge of 1.98 meters high played 32 games last season, being held in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 turns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valtteri Bottas was ranked in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Since the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into boxes and let Hamilton run on the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went out a long time later and set himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after an action with almost footed wheels that made Ferrari's pilot have to get rid of the free interior at risk of resisting after a double movement to defend himself on the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, began from the last row of the parlour and was placed in the seventh square at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race as he joined his tires to achieve a quick finish and to overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered boxes in turn 44, but could not increase his pace in the eight remaining rounds when he recovered Raikkonen's fourth position.
It's been a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real knight when I let him pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein in a half Saturday for his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he charged Brett Kavanaugh with sexual assault, the appointment for the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a myth in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, disgusting and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the filterings, and then they say, "But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I don't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
We've filtered... no, we've not filtered it," he added while he was imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh on behalf of Ford in July and was filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration would come from his office.
"I don't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep him confidential and therefore I did."
But his negative did not seem to sit well with the president, who during the middle of the Saturday night commented: "I'll tell you one thing: that was a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense against the appointment of the Supreme Court, which had been accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repugnance, they don't care who's doing harm, who have to fight to get power and control," the president said as Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday at Elite League before the Belfast Giants when winning the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local empath before Dwyer restored the giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen assured his victory.
This was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just won the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three parties.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to assistance from Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford provided the assistance so that Beauvillier would double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan again put on the local team with a desire to play at 13:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to equal the game at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer was assured that the Giants would take advantage before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first part.
The local team was regrouped and Bouchard once again equaled the game with a shot at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the leader for the first time in the party at the end of the second and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team when the end approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, play at home in front of Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane of the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he dies, making sure that an aircraft that transported hundreds of people could safely disembark.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to absorb the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his seat at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport control tower. This tower was being hit by a strong balance.
It remained firm to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the track at that time, could safely disembark.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian channel ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts break at hearing this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency states that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, since there were still many bodies under the ruins and many people could not be contacted," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
Some waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being delivered on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute there comes an ambulance with more bodies.
Water cleans scarce.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are they ready?", CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes early this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aerial Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the plane accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated healthy and saved the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be taken into account.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed against the water while trying to land at Chuuk airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers followed on Saturday at the hospital and that everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events still remain unclear.
The airline and the United States Army said the plane landed in the lagoon before the track.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's something extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist up to the emergency exits of the plane that began to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and yelled, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Army said that sailors who performed about a mile improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane sinks about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
Aviation security network data indicate that 111 people have died in aircraft accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended the submission of its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
I explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up the road on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lieving, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they were known only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on their phone.
"He erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A third hip hop wants to fill your music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop was removed from its origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make the hip hop conscious to be popular again.
Interpreters like The Fugees and Commons have seen a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York girl asks a couple to say goodbye after a "racist" text.
A New York girl is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she has received a mother's text message incorrectly complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed her condolences when she discovered that the new baby caretaker, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER NEGRA person," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she was sent to Maurice twice.
After learning about her stepdad, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice saying that her former girl, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and that she was waiting for a Filipino, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received payment for one day's work and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now requesting compensation from the couple for the dismissal in order to receive a compensation of $350 per day for the position of six months of internal work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things aren't done like that," he told The Post on Friday and added that "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the claims that they were racists saying that the end of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they could not trust her after she was offended.
"My wife had sent you something that I didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was wrong?
Your new birth?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as a "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going for someone like that?
That's not that it's a very decent thing," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has been rushed to denounce the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a spoken bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put in the place of someone who read it for the first time before her publication.
It is a pleasure to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before, was inspired by a playmate to write the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was something "agridulce" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to guess," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you're proud of him, even though it's not really worthy of you.
I think he saw the success of Paddington that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to fire my phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was urgently transferred to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that the situation was really bad, that it was not expected to do so," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be ready for you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep their heart pumping were slowly drained and left their system.
She had died before time and everything was disappearing.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't study, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry because I was in a situation around families and people.
I really had to stay firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane next to the other passengers, except for the terrible experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"I held my head and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from getting away from life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 when she began to suffer depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up anywhere."
However, he left the job before he died, since he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after he left life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that I can have an impact."
Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people you can visit and who you can talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't feel silent, you have to talk about it."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her mate who was 15 years old, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or anything," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we notice your change of attitude.
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: "Leave a void throughout the family.
He's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is a thread when the FBI starts research
"I thought that if we could really get something like what I was asking (a limited research in time, limited scope), maybe we could bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was going "to pick up" in the midst of a party's paralysis.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican partners not want the FBI investigation to be carried out?
Its negative is entirely due to chronology.
There are only five weeks left for the mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their efforts to achieve the choice of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the bill and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korean deserters "caen" numbers with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-one reached power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that last year there were 1,127 deserts, compared to 2,706 of 2011.
Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs charged by trafficking in persons have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments in this regard.
The vast majority of North deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says they have illegally crossed the border of more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demiled zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China believes that deserters are illegal immigrants instead of refugees and are often repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed in general to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for lack of progress.
"Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unarm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says it's not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority of the House of Representatives, said that the appointment to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "historic" and that it was not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was a hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave on Thursday before the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny the allegations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and teasing while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling charges against them of "gross and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed his partiality against the Democrats.
"I believe that it decalates itself with those statements and the way it has persecuted Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, it won't be fit to be in the Supreme Court alone, nor will it even be in the court you're practicing now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Appeals Tribunal of the District of Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the possible convictions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, since it is considered to be a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether to annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to seem to be all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to push it.
It's a justified diatrabe, it's months and years of rage going out, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, right?"
He continued, "It helped me a woman who was executive in a company and who told me that she also wept when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique for which when she was angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to: "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
Well, no, I'm angry."
And then I kept doing what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the brightest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, was once I found myself crying with unexpressable anger. A big woman, a serious manager of whom had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cockpit and dragged me down a stairs.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've cut you off."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extra-matrimonial adventure aboard a boat called Monkey Business, which had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, had no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would be present for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-premeditated decision," he told me among the laughs 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone referred to us as Blancaneives and the seven Enanites."
As the campaign was already very advanced, it was behind the fundraising process, so it was promised that it would not go back to the race unless it would raise two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to men, only $250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he delivered his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overcome by emotions (thank you for the people who had supported him, frustration for a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the capture of voters instead of delegates, and angered at sexism), which he caught up with.
"The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said recalling the press's reaction.
"You might have thought that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you going to put on my stone?
"Loró"?"
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and although there is still much left to end the battle, a breakdown between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts believe.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by putting oranges on the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale this week has taken place with new tariffs affecting $20 billion (15 billion pounds of sterling) in products, which charges half of the products entering the United States from China.
On every occasion, Beijing has taken equivalent reparations, recently applying tariffs from five to ten per cent to US products worth $6 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon come to an end.
To achieve that Washington backward would mean surrendering to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of the US trade war could help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make it possible to start a drop in the economy in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than what viewers have recognised so far," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia's issues for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, the Minister for Foreign Affairs says
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been taking over seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the country ' s conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their means of life are already met.
The United Nations estimates that since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that promoted insurgency.
Europe is done with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now carried six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, threw his point of exit to the water in the hole 16 pair 3, thus admitting his defeat in front of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari highlighted all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
US Jordan Spieth fell defeated by 5 and 4 in front of the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 in front of the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already taken eight Ryder Cups, became Europe with more victories of the tournament of all times, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am completely grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It is a achievement of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help," said a excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
Now you pass the spell to your compatriot John Rahm, who has already defeated the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods for 2 and 1 in an individual match.
"I'm an incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, which has won 14 great titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I am very proud of these guys, they have never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we lost him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have performed a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the American PGA and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will continue.
I want these 12 boys a lot and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's up to us to bend our heads.
They have overcome us."
