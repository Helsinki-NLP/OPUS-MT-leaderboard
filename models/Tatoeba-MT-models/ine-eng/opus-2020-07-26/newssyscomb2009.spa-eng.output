Right populist triumph in Austria, together form 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a appreciable weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an express strengthening of the party of the right populist.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OFP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously affected.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent vote, so it loses 5.5 per cent vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still, the GDP lost by 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of votes.
They are the worst, literally catastrophic results, in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the post-war and especially for the people who called these early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the WFP came out of the coalition, the populaces had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were made on the resignation of the party's president and, to this day, vice-canceller, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be achieved this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
This would, of course, facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the election results, i.e. the renewal of the large coalition between the SPO and the ODP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both parties to the right populist - liberal (FPO) have gained about 18 per cent and the BZO, one eleven per cent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same year 1999 would be the same when the people negotiated with the populists (the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it was dismembered from the BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a penalty by the European Union.
For this evolution I am clearly convinced by Haider who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and that he has already taken his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament, although it has lost slightly and descended from third to fifth seats among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the limit of four per cent and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem of the Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting scabbards is not being solved, it might be possible to cool down the Czech-India relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
That's how the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be resolved then yes, then it would certainly arrive at this cooling," he noted after the meeting organized by the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly be brought in.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local Darjiling government in whose jurisdiction the matter is concerned.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
He then asked for an exemption from the case and waited for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises you to appeal to the Supreme Court and then the pardon would be possible," said the Chief of Czech Diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the case is by obtaining a "legally competent support", the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to incarcerate and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The Minister omitted the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I have received many promises," he said.
A Czech Arbitrary a battle in the seabed
I'm approaching an electronic wall map, and it represents Australia surrounded by the sea.
He does not care, however, about the continent but about a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
At the same time, the region is as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the United Nations Division for Ocean Law and the Sea.
His chief, Director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed is hidden to this day, a world not known, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms so far, which in themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the solid ground
Coastal countries have today begun to wreak havoc on the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, these enjoy the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is essentially the so-called Continental Border, which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
It has exclusive rights under the Treaty in all the resources of the Continental Board.
"Simply, the continental border understands the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It reaches the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred miles of sea, i.e. pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request made by the country concerned to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the continental border must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a number of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal assistance committee.
The Commission has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries have come forward," Mikulka added.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first that essentially expanded its marine domain.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed surface that the commission gave him last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of pains for their study.
The profit that will be deducted from the use of the seabed will, as promised, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their requests.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Treaty.
As far as the Continental Border ends, the region of the oceanic fund declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," says Director Mikulka with emphasis, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contractually defined regime".
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then East Block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This achieved it in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico and the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is an accident, it's something as well as a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little patata or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend relived Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages, the German special forces command was at the scene of action
In order to resolve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany - the experts came.
When the situation was serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are available on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the rescue action, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, the German army officers and GSG 9 officers were at the place of release, and the federal police aircraft squadrons of the Federal Criminal Investigation Office were also experts in the field of logistics of the technical service.
As ministers' spokesmans reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, aware of a violent release, let their prisoners go and escape.
The Government of Egypt accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the ground.
" Luckily it didn't come at that time," said a spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the attackers had kidnapped a group of travelers made up of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
As long as the people saved healthy and saved came to Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the Embassy of Germany.
He did not say a word about the details of liberation.
At first, there was no information on their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first chamber of the Congress of the United States failed very little a large rescue package of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very dramatically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected the financial markets package by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all the appeals made by President George W. Bush and former political parties of both parties, there was no majority of the programme with which the financial market should be restricted.
With dramatic action, the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of the democratic negotiations, had asked Members to vote, although the plan was not so popular.
"It is difficult to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious disturbances in the international financial markets.
In order to allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for the organizers of German travel:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel bookings for the following months increased compared to last year - even the winter season in more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened situation, the desire to travel from Germany remains as before.
As reported Monday, the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume of 31 per cent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the research of the GfK market research institute, reserves for the autumn months had already been raised in numbers.
Thus, the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven per cent more than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results is GfK figures that are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are the travel reservations made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened dollar course, mostly travel to the United States is of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
Germany's preferred destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Most of the organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
In view of the increase in energy and food prices, in this case travel costs are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well reserved, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, went down.
My first October party
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Balneario, the beer in the jars of a litre and the famous people dressed in traditional bavar costumes by designers.
A debut in a campaign shop.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is red, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian suit in measure.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already used.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're just in the campaign shop, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with photos - it's very lisonary especially because I'm the first time in Octoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to be performing its function.
In fact, as a tourist in the Octoberfest from the north of Germany, my sense of well-being with a traditional Bavarian dress up to this day was still limited.
But after getting to the Teresa Prado, it's not all for that.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian dress or leather pants; none seems to be a case or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
I'm the only one who gets a rare look at a banana stand in chocolate.
A municipality calls my attention to my deantal who had dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is committed, behind is widowed."
Oh, my God, now I'm pulling back to the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don't worry much about subtle methods to flirt and carry hats where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and they show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves as an exhibitionist is called Bob, is from England and is also the first time in October.
It seems to him to be "gorgeous," which speaks with a very long "or."
I'll tell you what, after I put your glass next to a liter of beer you just had to drink.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most think it's a garbage cube.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others don't have much luck and they can't consume that much alcohol.
At eight o'clock in the night, health care groups run through the place of the party and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear every time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the steps covered from one campaign shop to the other.
This works as with most visitors: they arrive sober, they return drunks.
There is no one who suffers from alcoholism and is walking.
"They are the ones who "can't anymore," gave me the answer a health care officer answering my question and disappeared in a tumult.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in the Essex county.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred in Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of negligence.
Since then, he has been released under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Much before Turkey attempted to be a member of the European Union, European powers were losing the desire to penetrate the country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, there is one of the most interesting remnants of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, neo-renacentist style.
At least, that's what the guides say.
The building is set to watch the end of the platforms and leads forward two towers, one for each corner, looking like all a typical German town.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decade old.
But once the taquila was overcrowded, there is no doubt what the size of the company was that this was the most western door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His ferries were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
the British domain and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies outside Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a ammunition train exploded by destroying its elaborate roof.
The Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station has been falling apart and has remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, entrance door to Anatolia and all Eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakes, which produced the caances of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived at the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the past of the Ottoman.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmic change in Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and, in particular, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-sized malls and "power pastures" where middle class managers in business - men and women -- meet early in the morning to agree to do business.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time to the East and the West.
It is not one case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both things.
'But certainly at some point,' I ask you, 'Could Turkey be forced to choose?'
"Turkey," he answers, "does not want to face that choice."
He then underlines a point that almost all those with whom I have spoken so far have read almost from memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with all the Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thinking goes back to the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
Then there is no doubt in which it will be the continent to which this fascinating country must be claimed.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (that, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Coro.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent young choir, Proteus.
It's supposed to be for the under 21 years, but at the time the Proteus sang its end in 1979, several of us were finishing the 20 years - we just refuse to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological transformer of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it Madrigal or Messiah, regardless of whether not accompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that continued to be absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in the music.
So you just have to sing!"
Its variety was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposing, nor too flourished.
Whatever was the musical scarf, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a knight, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any means, been disappointed – on the contrary, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had this rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two war horses very well known throughout the world."
We'll miss you a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequencing of William Woodruff (September 25,) you state that "In 1946 economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... while at the same time studying for a degree in licensorship, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to skip this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flemish and Life" because his photographs in black and white, documental style, are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second attack on the Honda supervents
In November Honda will begin the marketing of the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor already has a wide habitat, this new monovolume presents an even wider inner space.
To all this, refined mechanics are added, which increase the driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analysing the new model, it must be noted that this new Jazz is six years after the first generation was introduced into the market.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, a country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Exactly in Japan about a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda expects this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units in 2007, estimates amount to 100,000 cars, which would result in 17% growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has traded a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which represents 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, managers of the Spanish branch expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
It is precisely the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to much drop sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 marketed units, which represents 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16 per cent decrease.
Despite this increase in Honda sales, its market share in Spain has increased, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axles up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, did not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, it also grows domestic habitat.
This profit is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a central fuel storage facility, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the suitcase - which has a double bottom system - rises up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation suitcase.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 suitcase is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - are an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees from the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two petrol propellers of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves less consumption, releases less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine system.
The first 1.2 litre mechanic gets a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm to 4,900 rounds.
This propellant - which Jazz used to reach 78 horses - presents a cost of 5.3 liters and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, it now turns out to have 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'beagle car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in concrete, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as a basis the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Mark Management, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Nissan Security Shield in four areas.
This robot has the intention to strengthen the capacity to prevent collisions of the brand's vehicles.
During your flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval way that looks much like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important are the compound eyes of the bee, capable of seeing with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder) has called.
It detects the obstacles that are up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an abortion microprocessor which is immediately translated into the prevention of collision.
"When you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels in a straight or larger angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and major engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upward or downward, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require to store information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about memory gigs, not even megas."
This is the first step to develop new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan's Vatican will introduce into series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last more than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear before Mortgage
It must be recognized that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to make injections, is not lacking in engineering.
Before the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on trash mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a threat and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Either the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or the Lions.
The tetrice aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is the time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but little detail.
It's more a page for teenagers than a site for all the public.
What if the game is complete?
Because there's a dream room in the hotel.
Something's something, 'cause buying a better house and talking...
Morgan Stanley sells participation in Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disbursement nine billion dollars to acquire 21 per cent of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong discount in its stock exchange.
One week after finding a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 per cent of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, ensuring a return of 10 per cent and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be based on a price per unit of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79 per cent to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the banking holding status," explained Juan Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes it pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His partnership with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday further show that the agreement has been modified during the last days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought that participation would have been made up only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we have wished to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Titles Morgan Stanley 7 % below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20 % of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may within one year convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if they are sold by more than 50 per cent above the conversion price, or at a rate of $47 or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
A group spokesman, however, refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan had to have relieved his balance from the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw their quote in a bag down half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on their debt was disposing.
This cost came back last month but remained at a high level, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the collapses of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refund the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example, of his colleagues and friends, was the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80% of the suffrage.
According to these results, "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the suffrage were null and 0,7% were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it was necessary to obtain half of the more than one suffrage.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the polling stations and an account by a non-governmental organization had announced a wide "yes" victory, estimated to be between 63 per cent and 70 per cent.
Rafael Correa also claimed on Sunday night on Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way " , he had assured, congratulated the Ecuadorians who headed the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
So Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by her Chilean colleague Mikaela Baclet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution involves increasing the power of the State on the economy, reserveing it for the " development planning " of a country that lives mainly through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currency they send to their immigrants.
Taken by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the head of State, who can perform up to two consecutive four-year mandates each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that she would use this power and claim a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population live under the poverty line.
It provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped persons have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived in Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
By the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all had a good look at their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft at the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to the Cairo International Airport.
Some helicopters immediately took them to the Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they could not speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into power by 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all lands in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the coasts of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and from then on they passed from one bay to another.
The group was composed of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the Safari organization.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night before dawn.
" A fire exchange occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the responsible who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "relampago" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of secret services, of special forces," he said without entering into details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the evening the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrestrial on board of which the kidnappers were found, of whom he killed six, including the Chadian chief and detained two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Nations Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately rejected by this group.
Letters - Most of the culture is silent
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place in the machetes and is taking up the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will be raised to denounce the miserable amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national famine - stricken historical sites?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore only the Chinon castle in the Loira Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of the heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and geology are concerned about finding in history, preserving with little money a few volumes of private files and preserving archaeological vestiges.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemetery.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands States - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian- Dutch Fortis bank, which is in sharp contrast with the effect of the hypothetical crisis on the US market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution in total with EUR 11.2 billion, which also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the Head of Economic Competition of the European Commission.
The Fortis Bank is the first to have suffered the euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that occurred in several waves over a year ago, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank may, in some respects, be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the property owned by the Bank in its area.
The Bank will sell a portion of its business, including, in particular, the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year by ABN Amró Dutch.
The actions of the Fortis began a strong descent last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees, this Bank is too large to allow it to fail.
The company's shares only decreased by 12 per cent on Friday, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the actions has decreased by more than two thirds.
Noting the current stock prices, the total market capital of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank's direction led to the sudden fall of Fortis' shares in the insecurity of the US market in connection with the approval of the US package plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday the actions showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new director general of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors were not concerned, will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's customers so far, no panic occurred, they did not invade bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the gallinero
In the United States, life and health insurance companies are often refusing to sign a insurance contract when they see the purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which are linked to the use of recipe data in all cases to the approval of the data subject.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chicken at the sororium" - quoted the Washington Post to Richard Dick, the designer of the medical prescription monitoring program.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance price and the amount of compensation of the customer's health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the client to medical check and signed the contract with him, knowing the result of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number, he easily gets the list of medicines bought in the last year and mid-year, and the program itself concludes on the customer's disease and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is practically irrevocably high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are numerous versions of the program, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company, in addition to the administration, has only something to do, although there are minor difficulties in this.
Among the program's disadvantages is for example that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances are used both to treat headache and heat waves and even to treat antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first is not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process this data, which, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacy, require the patient's approval.
The authorities are already obliged to do this, although they have not received fines for neglecting it so far.
Some companies recently also develop the results of laboratory tests and combine them with drug consumption data to obtain more accurate information on the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
It is before the Congress that the bill gives the authority the right to control the specialized companies for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his program, which will require the person's specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that that person cannot deny his approval, because if not insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the bear.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems in most global areas, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic development power that should have more voice and voice in international affairs, Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, chief representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase their trade to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
The twenty-one existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have thus been legally harmonised, so air transport can also fly in the future.
By the end of 2009, India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only 9th among the trade partners of the Union.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the situation of Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and welcomed the convening of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also agreed, although both parties had high responsibility for their failure.
The EU has confirmed that its energy and climate programme will be adhered to, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 per cent.
India also agrees with this, as in the climate conference next year, a global agreement should be reached and a 50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas production would be made by 2050.
They would also like to hamper the increase in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to pass on to the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will be charged with a value of EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian editors at the international sample of the book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international sample of the Frankfurt book is waiting for more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square meters of the sample with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the Italian pavilion opening ceremony: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
There will be a press meeting in the Room Struktur on the 5.0 bill of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the status of editorials in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books decreases progressively over the total Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying over the Nevada Desert, have been found.
The bumps have been found on a 3,000-metre high plateau, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
On the inside of the plane, there were no human remains.
The Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has raised the questions that remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is self-sufficient of what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
The millionaire, 63 years old, has been killed in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a squad of investigators who identified the device was sent a few hours after the sighting of the remains: it is the Bellanca 8kcab itself, scattered since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada's border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a post in history thanks to a long series of premieres.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's tour into an aerostatic globe: two single weeks of flight.
Three years later I had made the world's turn on plane and without scales.
Among its records, that was also because it flew 15 445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv outside the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the trucks all "compacts" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Owned by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and non-conventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms since the next 17 October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the start of the new car launched an unpublished mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominated the central shopping street of Milanes, Avenue Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication began with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed in the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Enlightenment8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recompensated in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will you be able to grasp the interest of future buyers with this formula?
is clear who are the Italian hooligans
In the Trivenet, the prohibition of access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now embarrassed? They are part of the group "Utras Italia" which has been following the Italian National for years and which so far, in truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival fanatics either.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These in Sofia have been added to a small group (little units, in fact) of the Campaign and the Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night have been pulled away so that they are not identified.
They inspire the English fanatics.
In Bulgaria, a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski, have been found.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fanatics 144 entries for the party: all with names, so easily controlled.
And the Minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia, there was no Daspo (prohibiting access to sporting events) at that time, no one who had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had a history of crime in stadiums, rejected the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry is waiting to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or identified in the riots.
A Daspo (prohibit of access to sports events) international which prevents not only Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't put any more feet in a stadium.
Good luck!
But now is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We need to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave like this," they say from the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why "eyes open" especially in view of the Wednesday's National Party in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters.
The Observatory will meet tomorrow, on Tuesday the Cams, which can also include a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems at the stadiums.
"Is Duce-Duce choirs and arms raised during Mameli's enamel? In Bulgaria is not a crime ...."
This is Domenico Mazzilli's thought (expressed in a unhappy way) for a few weeks ago, the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the post that was earlier from Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste's public security where there was a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a task to celebrate the Duke but, yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
"I do not do the sociologist – add No.1 to the Observatory – the reactors are assigned to the countries in which the event occurs.
So far this group has acted well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the savages at Mameli's anthem: they're also not a crime, but if they're allowed, they're not education...".
