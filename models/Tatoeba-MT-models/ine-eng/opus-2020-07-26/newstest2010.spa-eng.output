Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president of history.
Diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be received, inter alia, through exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time it will meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected it between 172 people and 33 organizations.
The Presidential couple then held a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, even if the third to receive him in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country currently in war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its critics.
During the ceremony Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During his full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend.
Obama from the beginning had a better attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of the accused nature of blackmail
The police of Litomérice accused the president of the association civica The company of nature defenders of Litomérice (Sociedad de Defensores de la natureeza Litomérice).
Last year he appealed several times against certain construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded money investors for their own benefit, said the spokesman of the Litomérice Alena Romová police.
The President of the Sociedad defensores de la naturaleza Litoměřice is Lubomir Studnička.
Currently detained and facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like the containers too much to separate the trash
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and containers can be found in villages in southern Moravia to separate garbage everywhere.
And Brno?
Allise takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate the trash for anything.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, cities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is totally delayed in the separation of waste, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially because of the number of containers for these wastes.
Have they ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle in the center to the appropriate container?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the square Moravské naměstí, in front of the Potrefená Huse.
Don't be angry with me, Mr. Onderka and his companions, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that it is not easy to separate the trash from elsewhere.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
Wagagian
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw several glass and plastic bottles into the trash.
But on Kaunicova Street, I didn't see any red containers near.
Fortunately, I found the right place by going to the trance.
However, the trash was already in the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city the extralige of hockey, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after a little surfing the Internet, with official statistics.
According to ECO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the entire region of Jihomoravský kraj.
The Paroubek budget took away money from the income and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the government's opinion, funds are added to farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the State debt nor international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Hacienda Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive expenditures, incomes or disease subsidies. "This is meant only to postpone the problems for the future, it is to put mines," Janota says.
What happens is that when you take borrowed money, you have to pay higher interest rates and, someday, you have to return the money.
The State does not have many options to obtain money.
If it does not reduce the social subsidies or operating costs of the State, it has to increase taxes.
To all those who added the left now: the bombs, teachers, farmers.
And, later, also to your children.
People don't have to worry about sickness income or subsidies, they'll get them.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; the coming year will not only be in the treasure 163 billion, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will continue to increase alongside the costs of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer be able to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity allowances, as the government did in its package against the deficit.
Due to the dislocation of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, the next year will also be five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
This is, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The best you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or ending the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from ČEZ dividends, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year in ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year, dividends are cleared of ecological damage, served to complete the income account or served as a reserve for the planned income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit at the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion budgets were made available to compensate the victims of communism and crime, or for the costs of disputes, including construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international fight, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, take out the government budget reserve.
There are also hundreds of millions missing for the State party project (State Fund), the price of which is two billion and which has already been launched. It should be possible to monitor online what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Agriculture does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smart phone can work with two operating systems
The Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
By just pressing a key, they pass in seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This is precisely the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on developing the virtualizer software for computers.
In your mobile you can take two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, Srinavas Krishnamurti of the VMware company indicated in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and demonstrated for the first time several days ago.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no longer any fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and US operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concerns hotelers
Not only do teleschiers in Krkonoshe worry about snow-free tracks.
Lack of snow makes people not reserve ski resorts in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, free rooms can still be obtained in Krkonoshe for all winter dates, including Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmases will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the Spindl information portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in Špindlerův Mlýn a Nochevieja according to their expectations should not hesitate to reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of the accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
Špindlerův Mlýn hotels offer mainly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give up and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what matters most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute navigable stays," Ingtours Petr Schiefert's director mentioned.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer the Nochevieja in Krkonoshe, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoshe.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will also be exhausted," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was harder.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
The interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja's apartments are already occupied also at the hotel Omnia, near the central parking in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně in Christmas half the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we meet about 60 percent of the capacity for occupation.
February has been a little weaker, but as snow falls, the interest in the stays in Krkonosh will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the hotel manager of Omnia.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hotels in Krkonoshe will pass through the desires of the snow waiting.
Thursday must fall the temperatures and, if there is precipitation, the mountains should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, Jirí Jakubský de Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic, reported.
U.S.: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question his predecessor's strategy, which he himself took for the stupidest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, which he looked forward to, it was shown that it was a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the phrase "equal to in Iraq" used several times, but it also failed to use the title of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward".
It was himself, who three years ago criticised Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision and with disastrous consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of the field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today nothing about Iraq is spoken of in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he could expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander of the Afghan General Stanley McCristal operation. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinated relations, subjected the indecisive rifles in the White House to a harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he had previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing the Afghan troops in 18 months and ending this procedure in three years. Obama's entire doctrine generated more questions from the answers he was offering.
Many doubt that the increase is the same as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratriculated wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare for Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss daily according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will continue to be only a people of Potemkin. After him, tribal patriarchal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "action capable", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by its volunteerism.
During the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to break down.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to the war to "come home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of US defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of the Afghan troops.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic reversal for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the lack of three years for presidential elections, and therefore there is still much time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
The directors of the Goldman Sachs bank will not receive cash bonuses again
The senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to respond to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior directors will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to join the bonds on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path to take, mentioned the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has been criticising for nearly $17 billion (approximately 30 billion CZK) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20,000 million.
The high bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive issue in politics, with the arrival of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonuses for bankers that exceed 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all the lowest physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, today received in Stockholm by the hands of King Carlos XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, he was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine received him from two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his fellow Jack Szkotak, for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in Chemicals received it by Israeli Ada Jonathan and U.S. Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomas.
The last award, the Nobel Prize for Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his fellow Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a female award, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis for all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each award collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
Where there are several awards in each category, the award shall be divided.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, the one from Peace, received it this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the dispute of having been awarded, since it is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations, wars are essential to achieving peace, even though their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Agriculture Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is calling for his stay in the government, because he disagrees with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the House of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota's stay in the office, is expected to be the subject of her meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances.
The meeting was briefed by the spokesman for President Radim Ohvat.
On his stay in the office, Janoto wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals on the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they cover up the budget deficit.
Between the left-hand side and the government, Klaus and the right-hand side, there was a serious internal policy conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucrat office, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, began to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, in fact liquidates the package of savings measures imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to stop public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; he said today during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians had been waiting long for "the serious problem", i.e. "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public farm.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is scary and that the government should think about its future existence.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Necza said to ČTK that the concept of the bureaucrat office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words as "strong sentences".
The chief of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is terrible, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed the 200,000 million crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells much about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonists play them by American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American actor winning an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was 91-year-old Mandela asked to be interpreted into Eastwood's film.
Another important role is that of Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The actor of seventy-two years, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama on the world of the million Dollar Baby boxing, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fiction president of the United States, and even of God in Almighty Evan. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation is still racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to join his people through the sport, and that is why he decides to join the rugby players, who belong worldwide to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the movies.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as much as possible as the reality," Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were outside the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, to be among the builders before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that when I held her hand, I received her energy, she passed on and had the feeling of knowing how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was when he finally met with Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much higher in the film."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and is also spoken of ambitions for Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film made."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The Secret of Splendor on Resolved Norway: Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia concluded yesterday by recognizing that close to the borders with Norway had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
In most cases, it did not fly out or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers, they write about "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the apparatus.
The engine probably exploded at the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, which was floating in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulvá".
The Norwegians have not hesitated since the first time that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that we cannot just talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile were sustained and it would have occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately at the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, only six of them failed under the management of the Ministry of Defence.
The success of nearly 50 percent of the generals is optimistic, and therefore they continue to say that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even be able to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA in Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will again present himself at 51 years of age to a professional hockey meeting.
The world's former champion, the Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help your team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday at KHL's duel against San Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and has committed himself to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to one party.
I believe that Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player of Russian hockey.
The legendary leader Gordie Howe played at the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 attendances.
The largest group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympics, seven world championships, won the Cup of Canada and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hall of the Glory of Hockey.
Hyundai has fulfilled the requirements of the unions. He will cancel all additional work
The direction of the car factory in Noshovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the extra work.
Exactly because of the frequent extra work, the trade unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the trade unions a further turn of the Saturday.
We cannot postpone our manufacturing plan because it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, 19 December, that is to say, it will work in two shifts," Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vanňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or can take a day off on December 28, i.e., extend the Christmas holidays in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees of Saturday's shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikeguists, who stopped the manufacturing last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all the extra work for December, Vaněk mentioned.
Car workers were forced to work two hours in addition to shifts of eight hours, and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the trade unions will cancel the strike.
Another negotiation between the management of the factory and trade unionists should be held on Monday morning.
The chief of the trade unions Petr Kucharř said on Wednesday, that if they commit to meeting the requirements and sign the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went into strike for frequent extra work.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management considered that the employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The trade unionists in their statement of emergency by strike on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, which last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
With regard to supplementary work, trade unions require the company to reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year a reward of 5,000 crowns is required for this work.
The car factory in Noshovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The series production started last November.
Until last September, he made about 80,000 cars; his current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance up to the 'encumbered' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists provides evidence of new compounds capable of moderateing the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not so effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some available medicines already.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be prolonged significantly thanks to a combination of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If replication of the virus is not completely removed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of the three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg shows the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that the substances called metalliccarbons have an effect on the albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metal carborans are compounds of copper, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that is different from all medicines used today, so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘better’ compounds, prepared to know the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
The metalcarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedra cages composed of the atoms of copper, hydrogen and carbon are joined by the atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, the breakdown of the HIV virus does not occur and mature and infectious body cells of the virus would not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are combined by a short organic series, which is still systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of HIV protease substances was carried out in evidence, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metallic carboran on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on the clinically used medicinal products, however they do not lose effect on the resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes makes it possible that metal carbourans are interesting components for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézáčová, the head of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
He fights for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "horrible" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were noted by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say it's time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Neczas said that the concept of the office office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nekhar, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the House of Members he wants to support himself in the minority, who tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, Necaj warned.
The House of Deputies adopted the budget for 2010, however, with the proposed amendments on the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed ODS' proposals, as the budget deficit is increasing.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the Government's desire, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and worthlessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and feeling of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government would reassess the current situation.
Sometimes it is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten to resign if the amendments were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká TV Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
He said, he's thinking of staying in the function.
The reason is their disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečar in the government, they have nothing to do with the ČSSD appointees, who imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly, if he resigns, if the chamber approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, income subsidies, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: The ministers appointed by the ODS are not guilty
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text message.
He recalled that in a number of ministries, there were people who belonged to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Sometimes he stressed that if Fischer decides to postpone the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public farm, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the House of Members".
However, it cannot count on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I didn't think about it, at the moment, I would take care of it, said the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of the ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer came out in the afternoon at a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS surrendered to the Prime Minister's request
Sometimes he stressed that on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies, ODS would probably vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, responded to the question, if ODS does not worry about the party's absence in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the negotiations on the budget.
He didn't realize that my vote was missing.
By abandoning the mandate, I knew that in the following months it was mainly the Bolshevik of the Chamber of Members and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek responded himself.
According to the new ČD train schedule, less trains will run at almost the same rates
České dráhy (Ferrocarriles Čecos) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total traffic extension will be reduced by two per cent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most of the rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region will gain more opportunities to link to the capital, and will add a pending career.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not go back to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by drift is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and around.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the Lysá nad Labem line in Milovice.
The long-distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/ Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From 13 December travellers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account for regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called proven losses Drahy will receive the year that comes four billion crowns in total, as this year. Local trains will be charged by the regions, the year that comes will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast trains and drahy locals have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year old.
Dragh is happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will only take place in one day's tickets - ČD Net and in the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For guests without a customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there were the only price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Filipino armed continue to arrest more than 50 people, children were released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was confirmed by the AFP agency, which previously only reported on 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that about 19 armed men use hostages as a live shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to wake up the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Armed Forces (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police had previously prosecuted kidnappers for violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was because of the recent murder, in which 57 people died, imposed the martial law.
Among the victims of the 23 November murder, related to the governor's election, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of involvement in the killing, the governor of this province was arrested in southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, they renewed the peace dialogues with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
A new film by Hollywood, Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech esInvictus: Neporažený) is being screened in the United States, which captures a part of the biography of the former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-known fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the protagonist role of Mandela himself.
The second role, that of the legendary champion in Rugby Francoise Pienaar, was interpreted by Matt Damon.
With the outside, they are born from the reactions of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, since it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the World Football Championship are being made in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are being shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new RSA film have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by Hollywood's "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well for it.
Many times I found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as it is said - collect his energy, mentioned in an interview after the outside party in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember Mandela's character and message through the film.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
On the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for many years apart. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as a protagonist also puts the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA won the world cup at that time.
To get into the grammaille in the suit, which in RSA is considered to be almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations fourteen years ago, especially the white public and the recognition of the white people.
The football champion may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned the Rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
The white South Africans are, however, skeptical, as he said in a recent interview for LN, a rugby lover Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer burns with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has caught tomorrow a transformer from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for firearms in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firemen wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed their opinion and the fire was extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatová, the voice of the company, and it would not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatová, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity, nothing like this happened, this kind of avarice is sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the voice of the ČEZ company for northern Czechia, the supply of the electric current was not cut, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of households, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps acted in the territory of the Czech Republic as the sole maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric power of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, and also maintains the electric drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Janchura will file a complaint against three ČSSD hetmanes
The owner of Student Agency Radim Janchura today will file a complaint against three social-democratic hetmanes.
This is Mikhal Hasek de la region Jihomoravský kraj, Radko Martínek de Pardubý kraj and el hetman de Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesarík.
Janchura mentioned it in 20 minutes in Radio Journal.
The demand has to do with the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České Dráhy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the pasta of the pasta", yet we only bring the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than České dray, which is not true. We know the prices of České dray, which were set last week.
So there's nothing else we can do to defend ourselves.
It's because of the slander against the Student Agency, he told Janchura Radio Journal.
He mentioned at the same time having evidence from all regions, and said he had not taken the necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Haszek considers this complaint because of the continuation of Mr Janchura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and appeal to the other Hetmanes who do it too.
I believe that, on this occasion too, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jancura manipulates the public in the area of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Haszek mentioned.
Janchura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
He told Radiojurnal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the New Year.
He needed the campaign to be carried out against corruption as such.
Jancura launched the campaign after the regions agreed with České dray to maintain regional railway links and for the charge of approximately 150 billion crowns did not summon a tender.
According to Janchura, similar steps are in conflict with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Janchura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of ČSSD, I know what you are talking about, I'm not going to say his name, Janchura said today for Radio Journal.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine will end the usual habits from January.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcals culminate.
The Institute for Medicinal Products is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have also made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born from 2 August last year may be given a pneumococal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before must also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to immunize their children against pneumococcals.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed for the vaccination of younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year in vaccines.
Without breast-feeding you will be saved in treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent around 500 000 children each year on vaccination.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
The neumococ is the cause of moderate otitis, but also of severe infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of the nemococal infections in our country every year, 28 children under the age of 10 die according to hospital investigations.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the neo-local vaccination coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, opinions appear at the same time, which this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the Nahlas civic association.
Your association has been promoting neococal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point, we do not think at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršenj said.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The President of the Society of Pediatras The professional company of practical children's doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the vaccine volunteeria has sus devantajas.
If all children were to receive the vaccine, they could be reasoned on reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started the vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect that from the year that comes more than 80 percent of young parents will allow vaccination against pneumococcals to their babies.
The pneumococal vaccine is also a major change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save then on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gave them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "take out the health insurance money".
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 frames on his vehicle and his trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and other men used an excavator to break into the museum, in the region of the Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan el Barbaro and Tarzan.
The Associated Press News Agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that a 52-year-old son of Frazatta told the police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse".
The agency said that Frazetta's father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure cuts in the pre-budget report, against the criticism of opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "disposed" an opportunity to show their seriousness on the cut of the deficit, delaying the decisions until after the elections.
The minister of Hacienda also received strong criticism for harming low and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% in social security expenditure and a top 1% in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Anger for Social Security
The trade unions regretted that low wages workers were punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will grow about three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which states that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRESSURE PRE-FILLED FUNDING
Social security with an additional 0.5 per cent increase, as of April 2011
The economy will rise above expected 4.75 % this year
New 50 % tax on banknote bonds
The increase of 1 point in corporation tax for small firms was rejected
Tax failures for electric motors and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £ 30,000 will lose £90 per year and who earns £40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person who earns £ 10,000 per year will earn £ 110.
The ministers said that their goal of reducing the deficit by half for 2013 was "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be above 5% of the highest wages.
The minister of Hacienda Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and the cost cuts outlined were a "street sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," the BBC told.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again toward the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract at 4.75 per cent this year, much worse than the decrease of 3.5 per cent predicted in April, while the loan demand would be £ 3 billion above what was previously estimated.
"Opportunity lost"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the labor party, said that the projected loan demand of £ 789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, adding, "cynically" to the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They have had the opportunity to do so and have wasted it."
"All important ads will be made after the elections, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police should be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek to reduce the deficit in the short term.
But liberal Democrats claimed that the money collected by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support the expenditures of the next year, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like sand castles.
The BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some subsidies due to the inability of the next month of April, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to allegations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could only be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided the most needed and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the expenditure data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really postponing the pain for later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant of Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget, and the markets are aware of this."
The FBI indica on "US arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five suspected American men of extremist connections.
The US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that men were detained in a row at a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A. last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said that he was also looking for information on men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they're American citizens, of course we're going to be very interested in the positions they've been arrested for and under what circumstances they're holding them," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokesman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the eye of the local police and that charges against the detainees had not yet been filed.
The Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton, refused to comment on the arrests, informed the Reuters news agency; but said that the United States had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the continuing recruitment and training of terrorist infrastructure".
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuse"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been the same as disabled, according to a report of the Amnesty International Campaign Group.
The report details "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said they had beaten him and burned him with cigarettes. Another said they threatened him with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Ten people have been convicted, and prosecutors state that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the story of Ibrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the outcome of the elections.
"They often beat me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-scientific.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
The Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was detained in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the ill-treatment of the post-election and government response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the parliamentary committee's investigations had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski track was taken in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn Bristol's site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill park there was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-metre track.
John Hickman, a four-year-old medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite scary.
It is seen below a beautiful view of the city's lights titling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
The awards were delivered to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will be let loose.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laico state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have asked for the construction of mines to be prohibited and when there is a generalized warning about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French don't like sails" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has been months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide to the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic Spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it lawful for a Muslim to use a banking system based on interests to obtain a mortgage?
These are seemingly worldly issues, it maintains, things of daily life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of their reputation, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab academic and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his counterparts from Salafi, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions to what extent the French political strategies (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defending secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than growing pragmatism, it perceives "a value adjustment."
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The most devastating panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it the life that can't survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On thin ice" ("On Thin Ice") Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the North icon, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of the whale hunt, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value in the face of the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a valuable 14-year-old catheter, fighting only with the end of his mosque, is probably a myth, but others are true.
The creatures, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly extinct mothers, were captured and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century showed 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even at present, zoos are still generally a millionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore has been greened by algae growing within areas without hair of its fur.

Ellis uses reports from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of species.
Although it is banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and motorbikes squadrons use high-power assault rifles to power their preys.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alu Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scalable story about the science of the Arctic and an overtaking view of how to transform the future of that place.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the rate of change.
It's not because of a lack of commitment.
The pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century gave indications for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the submarines of the cold war drew a map of the ice chains moving below the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camping in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looked within the extraordinary, diminutive world of the afluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater chorus which was compressed while it was frozen.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic marvels of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, what is believed can happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 that put crowns in Arlington's graves
De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never known.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
Within a few months, from where we're sailing, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we are, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to put crowns in the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrisl Worcester, the owner of the Crown Worcester Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping in different cities along the way to organize events dedicated to military and terrorist victims.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wraiths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the National Cemetery of Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a late military career.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Covered in warm clothing, volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers turned to older graves of World War I, World War II, and Vietnam war, because they did not receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful while the children played and the couples were taking the hand, while taking the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red link attached to the top.
Nearly there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the Soldiers) gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the shadow atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the ice-cream.
Some read aloud carved names on the stones, while others bent to see small white and black plates placed within the wet clay, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who swallowed the tears of her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the marine artillery Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, he said.
"I want someone to remember it a long time after I die."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, officials of the Department of State said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything that is considered "hazardy".
All activities called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writing, involve the risk of arrest.
Graffiti anti-government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an early community blogger, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested permission to leave the country to accept awards on several occasions, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor can probably cause tensions between the Communist government of Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, who has been looking for a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to introduce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and codified in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors in the hotel, and in some government facility, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the U.S. Department of Interest in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in Cuba's prison are amongst crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly undecided.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as sharing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the American Human Rights Watch organization, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba," a reference to Raúl Castro's location as the country's leader, to replace his older brother Fidel's illness.
Vivanco said the accused were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
It demonstrated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops, demonstrating that they hope the case can help to demarcate an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet in search of radicalized young people.
Researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah addressed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered to be part of a covered operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from the anonymous due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that men were not immutable and were even trying to obtain adequate approval to access Qaeda camps when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, identify those who are trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, United States intelligence has made it a major priority to try to infiltrate people within Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guardians, not letting those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda was looking at the American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction because of their potential to have access to American goals and because of their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those they admit, because US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model how many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has been transformed into a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched down the streets demanding the negotiators working at the City's Bella Center Convention Center, more bold climate action.
The protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the talks on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city holding English banners saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that said, "The Earth says "that's enough."
Several famous members joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru's native country, her mother's native country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country must deal with because of the impacts of climate change that are already happening."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join in the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the world's leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he manifested.
This is not an easy task, but one has to do, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or wearing pocket knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to one witness, who requested not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists with sports masks and black actors placed several explosives near Copenhagen's main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as callers, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest didn't seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "It was not really about the situation."
Then he went on in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to determine whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this showed public attention in general and in different sectors on the subject of climate change.
On the other hand, "the negotiations can also be said to affect the freedom of other people.
Data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal book of qualifications last week on performance in mathematics was a very good news for the public schools of the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performance systems, the qualifications book has shown that fourth and eighth grade students have slowed down at a faster pace over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of the fourth grade white students of the D.C. in the last two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African American parents only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eighth grade Africans remained essentially fixed, lowering a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average score of the whites was not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
During a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference that separated the fourth grade white and black students in 2003, when the first ENPE was introduced in the District, was 60 points from the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some District education lawyers expressed concern last week, as the progress made by Rector Michelle A. The Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrata) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by caring for those on the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates education equity in the District.
I am not giving a leap of joy for a difference of two or three points, said the D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's administration style, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what concerns us is that we are not spending neither the time nor the energy needed for our secondary schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, directed to students of the higher degrees of primary and secondary school, who did not dominate the early reading grounds in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from childgarten to sixth degree, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who was credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here is a kind of rough dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies scores of urban evidence.
The solution to conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political impacts that are against this important timeframe.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she is trying to stick to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now the Newark School Superintendent, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with the union of his teachers last year in a year of 185 days, who considers it a "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong response.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, came down and parked for a moment in front of the white columns, the brick façades and the emerald beaches.
Graciela’s parents had only graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot in a university campus.
Even so, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the record costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of potential enthusiastic students.
Yes! Here is where I will be! he exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of science.
Caray, seriously?, said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of school-students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh child to have visited on his three-day trip, and had already completely absorbed his deliberate message: The question is not whether you will go to university.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduated from university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university, especially if efforts are sustained over time.
Noting low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is apparent that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to the secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour of the universities of Graciela is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to implement university preparation programmes, which start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Ministry of Oil Iraq reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a key role in restoring the oil industry in Iraq, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have gone up in only two of the 10 underlying deposits.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer was lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for deposits raised in June.
The poor representation of US oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news center.
It'll be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, accentuated by mass-coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while US military withdrawing, probably prevented US oil companies from risking themselves more energetically in Iraq, which has the third most important reserve of cruelty in the world, analysts said.
US companies were in some cases in disadvantages, because rivals, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who have drawn ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main deposits.
We know that China is about to become a major economic and technological power, the spokesman for the Assam Jihad Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the same time as its competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The companies selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the grant by barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each stock.
The main planner of the Qaeda has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a alleged US missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a major operations planner of Qaeda this week, U.S. smuggling officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who was thought to have died Tuesday when a couple of missiles attacked their car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said that missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a civilian intelligence agency official from Pakistan said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner from Qaeda, who directed the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiracy all over the world, said a senior official, who spoke from the anonymous, citing the delicate nature of US air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to Qaeda's superior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalia had quickly climbed into the Qaeda lines and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but it does not in any way reduce the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of non-pilot attacks conducted by the CIA has decreased since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to an account of The Long War Journal, a website directed by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while killing suspicious informants violently, the site said.
United Nations Maximum Mission in Kabul to Refuse
The United Nations sent to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that it would resign in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that had been damaged by allegations of corruption in Afghanistan's presidential election supported by the United Nations.
The Eide exit takes place when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but he was concerned that the US timetable for the military withdrawal that began in 18 months moved other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials working with Afghanistan ' s political transition.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not abandoning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between the exit of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously directed United Nations peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested in front of his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's accusations, who was dismissed, "probably damaged the mission, because there was already much skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said she proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also spurred the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which are being entrusted to the Afghan mission, affirming that this would increase his confidence in the proper use of his money.
Eide expressed her frustration at the limitations of her powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the huge United Nations procurement regulations undermined her ability to capture talents.
That is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and you can't keep going.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, due to their failure to engage in talks about their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week wartime trip to Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important in the perspective of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictableness of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions directed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and incentives", "to convince the Iranian government that they would be really less secure with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "cruel" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would negotiate again on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran has seemed to have withdrawn from the trial agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian mandate is divided in relation to the possibility of being committed to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that actually accepted in early October has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set the deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options were replanted, even to continue with what Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "destructive sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations reported what Thursday called "unfounded and baseless accusations", by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said that it had the will to continue talks with the United States and other five world powers, " in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was going to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish region of Iraq rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that spoke to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby but means another grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the elderly population of their city, suddenly changed this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to a child.
We have nothing left for a second, Wang said, 31 years old, a human resource manager with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after the policy of a single child was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously horny children, single children abused, affectionately "little emperors", is emerging a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to six when policy was effective, according to the Division.
The population of the United Nations, while the number of residents aged 60 years and over is expected to exploit from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1. per cent by 2050, is much higher than the overall average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with very well-known populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning Commission and Municipal Population, has demonstrated that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the elderly population and mitigate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
As drafted in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single child of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have misused the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female proportion.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually abandoned their position on the policy of a single child.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 many of their hardline slogans were eased.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Institute for Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost evening morning, the posters that ordered families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city's government sent family and volunteer planning officers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disabling Response
Although the officials of a rural city outside Shanghai said they observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples who wanted a second child after the campaign was launched, the most urban districts did not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications a month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly more than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipality family planning committee in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want any more children.
They want to give their first son the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally enabled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient medical and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they maintain, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West wrongly view single child policy as a matter of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
Yeah, we're stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wanted a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to taking care of others and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owned a translation agency, explained it more thoroughly.
For parents with two middle-class careers, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it is to be successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents struggle during the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a long time from parents, he did.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategic "have to have a curriculum prepared for the best custody when the child has 9 months."
Most of your friends are willing to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he manifested.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A United Nations group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, took a renewed focus on Friday with the disclosure of a document providing for ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialised nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiations that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
As drafted by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not mention how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequiyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page paper, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN climate officer Yvo de Boer described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 per cent and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks on Friday, promising to provide $3,600 million annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday presented the same kind of verbal artificial fires that dominated the conversations last week.
The United States' special climate envoy, Todd Stern, rejected claims that require mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that Obama was adopting a harder line with China with respect to what the Bush administration officials had done just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the United States' largest climate negotiator lacked "common feeling", or was "very irresponsible" because he had said earlier this week that the United States would not economically help China to cope with global warming.
With the future economic path of the world's major power at stake, the lines of failure have erupted both within the world on the development path, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that the main powers were discussing who should cost the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in seeking to contain the major issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change adviser in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that the talks would produce a political agreement at the very end.
The Small Island Alliance, which has 43 members, drew up a proposal for a preliminary 24-page treaty early Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and require the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency while delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the heads of government came to a close.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran to the corridors of the Bella Center, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, in order to be able to limit the claims that will be raised during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people come in and out of the convention center every day, the activists who touch guitar present night shows praising the countries they think are selling, and preliminary hand-to-hand proposals instead of via e-mail) poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President of the Global Conservation Policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first 225 km train from Great Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 p.m. on Monday morning, a sild will drill the darkness to mark a train exit that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed interurban train in the country will reach 225 km, when passing as a beam from Ashford, Kent, at St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first Interurban Javelin service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected secluded areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be cut short, and the change of aircraft and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as ease congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of thousands of millions of books that are needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fear of environmental damage, can still stop the high-speed lines of Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will submit its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed route from the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 metres from a final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will set three options for a wider high-speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is a Y-shaped setting, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One line would enter Scotland.
"It seems this will be the most beneficial option," said one member of the railway.
Once finished, travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first plot, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to the little more than a current hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km, turning the British network into the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to support 400 m long trains capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that you would need a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
In view of the restrictions on capital space, an existing station is expected to be expanded to adapt to the high-speed network.
The experts in the railway industry maintain that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should be carried out, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is started, the network would have to be built in sections.
In the beginning, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines by the existing carriages north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel time between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers face the mortgage by an orange of £75.000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the voice of the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison voice, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived "of rations", increased their mortgage in £75.000 to build an extension marked as a slave in their second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Lächt, who conducts a review of the members' expenses. Mr. Duncan said last night that the requests “could not be clearer or simpler”.
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, has a two-bed house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office of fees agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a winter to the house, described in the plans as a "narangal".
The neighbors described it as "a winterhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on its earlier mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee dismissed him from violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds of London's property to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the previous year to become a deputy.
The documents circulated this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately 1,400 pounds per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The type of interest in the mortgage of the Royal Bank of Scotland of Mr. Duncan did not change at that time, suggesting that the entire increase would be financed by a loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable mortgage type of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the type to which it is now located.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1.250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as president of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the MPs had to survive "of rations" after the scandal of spending.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live with rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I like my money in my garden and I ask for a small fraction on the basis of what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as a oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this could "be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the symbol of the sterling pound in Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he had requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when he was asked about the increase in mortgages, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legge."
He added: "It is not about avoiding and depriving or infringing the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler."
Let those who have faith come to see the calendar of the Event of the Palapade of Brighton Beach
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palate for every December day, using purple as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palate from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with pastel filled and served free.
The villars elected so far include Vi Three Boats, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La First Christmas, where the palate presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV marketing assistant at Hove, is a non-remunerated clergyman of the Chichester diocese and Beyond leader.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think that the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the Event of the Palapa started as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to try and represent it through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and the whole world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday on the claim of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, had been paraded by the Danish capital ice cream in a claim for an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the very high "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents erupted shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke loose with adoquines and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
Anti-disturbing police intervene quickly and firmly.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people in total, according to it, particularly members of the Black Blocks, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinctions", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night, married and sitting in spite of intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took the place of the Bella Center, the headquarters of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, took a look at candles.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial plumbing responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of Earth to form "blue tides" by "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.
We can't keep saying: there's time, said the benefactor Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers are dried, watercourses for which you can walk as never before could be done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Pacific region, which gathers numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial summit the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, showed red dress and flashing armchairs in favour of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters claimed to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abjasia elected president, although Georgia complains "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a prorusa separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi complains "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 17.00 GMT.
According to Abkhazia Electoral Commission officials, participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically rejects the idea of reunification with Georgia, which rejected the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "promote that Abjasia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand dead, Abjasia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new being as an independent state, declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted in Bagapch.
She was among the electors who addressed the election table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees in the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with subtle landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large tables show Bagapch alongside the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the poll.
In a short ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered by lifting his vodka vessel.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the low railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change, where the police, alerted, arrested more than 700 people around an impressive demonstration.
Some 30 thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, were paraded in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped at about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, took a look at candles.
A few minutes after the beginning of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all black clothes, broke loose with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturbing police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the floor.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people, stating that it was mainly members of the Black Blocks, ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the mandible with an adoquin, and four cars were fired near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of some twenty people, according to the police.
We did not remove the eyes of the extremist groups from above, preventing police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen from flying over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, including Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial plumbing responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of Earth to form "blue tides" by "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.

The Oxfam organization, together with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was supposed to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific region, which gathers numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial summit the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 5,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, in most of their students, showed red dress and glowing armchairs in favour of solar energy in front of the Philippine Capital City.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters claimed to act against climate change were formed.

The assignment of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview to be delivered in the Informative of Sunday (JDD, according to his French mark) that history and geography would "strengthen" the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachelorship.
From now on, all the first bachelor students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "just with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally, calls the best students."
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be branches of the C, it continues to be underlined even: "I also heard that historians or intellectuals were angry that they had eliminated the history and geography in the second bachelor's degree in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven French people of ten (69%) rejected the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geographical education in the second year of Bachillerat C. Many intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "not spoken" to eliminate philosophy from the second programme of Bachelor C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called on a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they said sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Mester 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will deliver an admission test aimed at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their teaching ability, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will practice in real terms during the year of M2, and then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the class, i.e. over 300 hours, added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also confirmed the project to delete the school map "before 2012".
In the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain in a convincing way the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, a challenge that was accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the General School of the Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the "Ernest" conference wheel, a day consisting of a series of presentations by 15 minutes experts, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and convey their desire to know more, he explained in the framework of the Edouard Hannezzo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school stall.
We selected some twenty participants among the experts of your discipline and selected them on your charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," AFP said Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics against about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public understands that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record".
The videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website as of 15 December.
The next day of "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: dissatisfaction between prison guards, planned to take action
The prison guards' unions called Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year, the prizes and extra hours, which was postponed until budgetary reasons were lifted.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd union of guards) asked staff outside the service to join the event on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their possessions.
The penitentiary CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "reunite in general assemblies in different prisons to achieve massive mobilization", since they hesitated to "glorious and unacceptable" the failure of payment in December of the " extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and festive days" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explained that the extra hours had increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but assured that the balance would be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor informed that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard trade unions ensuring that payment would be made next month.
No doubt about the efforts made by staff to operate and modernise our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours does not occur again in the future.
The December payment will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous prizes by function and objectives, and who "always blames the budgetary requirements", said Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, he said indignantly the interregional association FO of Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott up to a new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with the extra hours, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking more effective action, it is more than regretful to attempt to attack the staff's salary, the Burdeos prison CGT estimates.
According to the trade unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not the expected, said Ufap's secretary-general Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those who receive
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous TV shower Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion regarding gifts: "I do better gifts than I do."
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be of the game.
Father Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreeed with her husband's statements about the quality of the gifts she received: "No way last year I made you beautiful gifts," she provoked the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before he answered with humor pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During one hour's interview, in an atmosphere separated by the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported the Presidential Campaign of Barack Obama, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts of the child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball ball, the President said.
Only many years later, I realized that he had given me that balloon.
On her side, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, then I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of staying around the house, however, I loved that doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induction
Johnny Hallyday was again involved in Los Angeles because of important "lesions" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his allies, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles hospital, where some doctors checked "derivative lesions from the operation" of discal hernia held in Paris on 26 November, pointed out their press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical unit would be reported within 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the last singer's turn, Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, to be submitted to a coma induced to avoid "pangs and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we'll have more certainty about his condition, add RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no channel would have been introduced to him after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parque Monceau because of a discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajaux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
The singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles on Monday for an infection caused by the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday in RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but assured that there was no "no problem" because the rocker was "a fighter".
He called me just before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was a fool to make twelve hours of flight after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the producer of the musician, Jean-Claude Camus, intended to calm down by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "responsibly responded to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days as a result of a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, for general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated with a "colon cancer", after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as was expected, his long "Third 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been commenting excessively. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, their allies even had to neglect a new institution.
Euro-2009/short pool: first title of Bousquet in its favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-star medalist in the World-2009 long pool, got an international title on Thursday at a distance where he feels particularly affected, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in the short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which the polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, which coded the world record in 50 m free, brand that has in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal distances of the swimming, 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20'53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international premiere.
Bousquet progressed to the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was at my disposal, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane baths which will be banned from January 1st.
These bathers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epoch in Istanbul, where they competed for the same test for the first time in 1999.
This time the use of the bathers did not help German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in the long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not reach its mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was charged with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew this time I wasn't going to be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: A sarcophagus panel owned by Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, much above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This 2-metre panel is 63 cm high, date from the 3rd century after Christ, and its price was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionisian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by Hebrew satires and women, is a little common since there are only four or five in the world," AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions from ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's, explained on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred batches.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the highest by the buyers, no doubt, pointed out to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was a acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then subsequently appeared in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bath in his private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time before the captain Petin took power.
For some 50 years, his stand was uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an open-ended Emile Zola succession in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the freshness of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's exit to Mexico
The Mexican Thursday felt that the conditions were not given to move to its territory to the defeated president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the Golpist government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the move, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take it to Zelaya returned to its original location, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the Golpist government wanted to force Zelaya to "remission" and to ask for political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as Head of State in the invited exercise.
The Golpist government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya said on Thursday to Radio Globo, in which it is common to make statements since the beginning of the political crisis that took five months in Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added by playing some deals with the depositary president, who has been refugee in the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because we did not contain asylum requests, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Golpist Government Oscar Raúl Matute on HRN radio.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview in the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is located in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I'll do it as the president of the Hondurasn people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized Wednesday to the supporters of the deposed president, who met around the embassy of Brazil, strongly located by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Golpist government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was defeated on 28 June, the day on which he held a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes, he will be arrested and must answer to the Court for the crime of "high treason", according to the golfist government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, reached a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress massed against the return of Zelaya to power until its mandate ended on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67%; and Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1.102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, Lindsey Piezza from FTN Financial said.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the middle full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit in the United States fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared with September to $32,900 million.
On the contrary, analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
Great innovation is the growth of volumes of trade, in particular exports of goods, reflecting the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the course of the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "was the lowest for a year," stressed Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year treasury bonus performance rose to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bonus to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on the evening.
Cuba: more than a hundred power supporters abuse the "White Ladies"
This Thursday, hundreds of Cuban-led supporters attacked the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the World Day of Human Rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Forty "Damas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they headed to the capital center claiming the release of these detainees, a journalist of the AFP supported.
The Yankees died!, "Mercenarias!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" were coerced with the fist up the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were heard by civilian-dressed agents who came to protect them.
On the evening, a similar demonstration was launched against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also about to manifest themselves on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, a AFP journalist reported.
The agents forced the vehicles to the dissidents who were harassed by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances takes only a few hours.
The "White Ladies", awarded the 2005 Sajarov Prize by the European Parliament, had set up an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissidentity, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom follow the ranks.
The Cuban authorities target opponents of "mercenaires" or "agents" at the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Surprisingly in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of Thursday's government militants against the " contra-revolutionarys".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of paving the rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien killer to an octogenary with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Highs of Sena) on Thursday at the time of the greatest flood in the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker would have beaten two knives and for reasons not yet determined, to an elder in the pharmacy or in front of him in No. 85 of the Jean-Jaurès boulevard, reported police and witnesses sources.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a police union officer of the Alliance.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about 30 years old, was interned and injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other injured, with the seemingly affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a stroke and was hospitalized "in a state of shock", reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped the storm of Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have hurt two more feet: one thirty-year-old man, and one forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unexplained.
He was armed with two carnivorous knives that he had crossed in the back, explained in the place a union officer of the Alliance in the Altos del Sena, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to the testimony obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, he explained Alberto, the roommate of a nearby bar.
A crowd was sent up, including a police officer who broke his wrist, added.
At the time of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded by gunshots, according to the police's testimony.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important injury in the abdomen, he told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without ID.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Police Office of the High Court of the Senate (SDPJ 92).
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he did not speak.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of hospitalizing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him in the Clichy's police station where he was transferred.
It was "in a state of super-exciting" as "everything disturbed by this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of the action".
US: Polanski's lawyer again requests that the case be dismissed
The French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under domestic arrest in Switzerland, was dismissed by a case of sexual abuse over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, counsel of the director of "El Pianista", denounced three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that at this very moment the charges are dismissed, since the judge's conduct on the basis of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was heated".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who had died since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before giving sentence, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wished and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel appealed for a trial that would allow him to submit evidence of his argument in case the court rejected the rejection of the case.
The charge, on the other hand, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, that there could be no serious assessment of the destabilization of the charges as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was pronounced for "unlawful sexual relations" with less than 13 years of age.
Ever since then, he has never walked back to the United States.
The Deputy District Attorney of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear in the audience."
For this reason, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused people, that there is a possibility to flee?, Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor to the court, even though she despises her authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to disarm the cause against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also appealed once again to close the case.
She argues that her client no longer supports her every time the Polanski case is brought up, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by order of US arrest.
After more than two months after the raids, he was sentenced to house imprisonment in his Gstaad cabin, waiting for any extradition.
Wall Street loses track and stops by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday, in a market that is debated among better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: Dow Jones won 0.63 per cent, but Nasdaq lost 0.03 per cent.
According to the final figures at the closing point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average raised 65.67 points reaching 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, of a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located in 2.190,31 points.
The extended standard & Poor's 500 advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blackxilver, from Marblehead Asset Management, pointed out.
It stays with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and I think it's going to last until the end of the year.
The trend was sustained thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's opinion on the robustness of economic reactivation", analysts from Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November by a second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers was clearly regained in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed down by a new advance of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months in front of the euro, which "takes down the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
In this way, the technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bonus performance rose to 3,540 per cent on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bonus to 4,497 per cent on Tuesday.
The Choice of Miss World Again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of billions of spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportist or, even, Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real revue.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I have seen many things and have lived countless experiences!," said surprised Miss Sierra Leone.
This event, which takes place nine times in South Africa, will be broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, North Johannesburg, from 17 a.m. (15 h GMT).
It's impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I'm very happy to have flown twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and the possibility of discovering again "African countries that remove the encouragement".
After a month of gala, tests, press and safaris, the candidates to Miss World focus on the contest.
Pooja Chopra India expects to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Ashwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
The dream of all women is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it is not just the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade with traditional dresses and, of course, with bathrobe.
The Chinese presenter Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a member of the Miss Mundo committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa has proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to equalize, assures Julia Morley, president of the Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, but this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who reached out to them.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
Your best memory will undoubtedly be the City of Cabo (Southwest) tournament for the World Football in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've dealt with people I've never thought of coming to know.
He's probably back for the World 2010, says excitedly Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "I'm very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, he told the press David Hallyday when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after the 13h locals (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, separated, assured that he would move "as before" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection resulting from the discal hernia operation last November 26th in Paris.
The musician is "as induced since that night in Los Angeles for convenience, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service reported.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, followed by a discal hernia operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday night on Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attended to attend a school event, confirmed a photographer from the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Hospital of Pitie-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer last November 26th at the international private clinic of the Parque Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were angry, Camus said.
It's about a possible request, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "brought too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor, and he surprised me when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, because I was operated twice as a discal hernia, he added.
Shortly before in the RTL station, he pointed out that the singer had apparently gone "without a canal, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated at the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux was working at that time.
In 2007, I also intervened at the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a brain hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by justice on several occasions by mispractices, as well as tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scruples" charged "on a regular basis" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It noted that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not provoke bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer's turn, whose health problems have increased since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
No doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems to me very risky, Camus said.
The UDF Association lifts the tone and warns the New Centre about the use of its seal
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the seal of the former Giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, his regret being claimed.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, since he felt that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his management, he received the assistance of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as it was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association office, controlled by friends from François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and to the MP, urging them to renounce the seal and transfer the rights of the brand to them, their punishment for judicial action.
In recent days, you have made many statements implying that your political movement was going to propose the UDF mark, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centralist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the +Nouveau center+, and the slogan + the UDF today's+ slogan on its militant material and on the website's presentation page, the signatories support the letter.
As they already know, they have no right to use the seal, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to remove "the name of the UDF from all support, as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to the legitimate rightholders".
If not, justice will be called upon to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a true political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "elected" to go in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore does not have, according to them, any right to use the UDF seal.
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its membership of the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continue the office, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but from the UMP.
It is scandalously and fraudulently exploits the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to do so on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they complain, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to attempt to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to refer the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt said, she took advantage of the octogenary's weakness state to expel it from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars in the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum of three years imprisonment and €375,000 fine.
This means that in this case there will be a worthy process of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter quarrels with the laughs of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
But the Correctional Tribunal no. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years of age, to be subject to medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's successor and principal shareholder has always refused to submit to such examinations, even under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt has suffered from weakness and during what periods.
I think he'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, she said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, was leaving the audience.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The experience will show that he (Banier) manipulated this great woman, whom we must protect, said.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother's weakness for years to get billions of euros in donations through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considered a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers at the court held a large family confession on some occasions.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he had mistrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Ever since his wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
On the other hand, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the applicant was not in a position to appear, as much as a guard judge in these last days refused to take place at his request to open a judicial safeguard procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under custody and has no guardian.
No one else can appear in place," said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered once.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large enterprises with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that employees adhere to certain "values" from above as previously it was to impose on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the company's centre, the marketing revolution gave rise to the strategies for the conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that do not relate to the customer's preferential factors is repeatedly repeated.
A demobilization of employees can end up in a deadly demobilization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially I+D and, more importantly, business intelligence.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires all parties involved (...) to have a proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; this requires the employees to make a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would involve putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns as much as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire by Orange among his employees, encourage the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
"In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many times, all companies end up doing what they've always done! B989
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most of the directors have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from major engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviorist theory that American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread to their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the executive's commitment, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the directors in a mechanical management position, which is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies is intended to adopt a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realising their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifuncial Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a default doll that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the mobilization factors, corporate directors can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and re-establish human resources management "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable area for organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: by the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the North American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against US enemies, he hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had denied the award to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former candidate for the Vice-President during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican Party to the U.S. Journal Today, and added that she had addressed the subject of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, since then, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists, he noticed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, one way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, and the former President of the House of Representatives was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At the moment, the talk seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a potential candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could give a prize of peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speech and current chronicler at Washington Post, Obama made "a very North American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world", as "always does," he spoke as a North American president when he reminded Europeans "that they live in a security bubble they did not create and that they don't do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wing, a bush-era halcon, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech "Monoton, Pretentious and Lack of Inspiration" on the website of the National Review Online.
At the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed by seeing Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-wing press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, described his speech as "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said excitedly.
Obama "received the speech that was needed," said the New York Times, judging it "at the same time as shade and building".
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure navigation
After three marathon negotiations, road trade unions and the Tlf (Transport and Logistics of France), the only master organization that remained until the end of Friday afternoon came to an agreement ending the strike signal and the threat of infant supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Transport Secretary, Dominique Bussereau, was "rejoiced" by the agreement, after several negotiation sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators fired on Friday evening with the hope of quickly signing the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) were withdrawn by giving a doorway.
But a meeting of more than six hours beginning at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "was very harmful to businesses" and "was afraid of disrupting the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for higher (international transport).
The rate per hour goes from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantages, said Patricia Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there are no more cuts or locks in the supply centres.
But there can always be some unconforming rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good agreement", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will, above all, address the issue of an extraordinary pay and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employer charges" was the subject of an amendment of the government in the draft law on rectification finance for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The signing of the Tlf allows the agreement to be applied firstly to companies affiliated to this organization and secondly to all professions, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was a "ingenuity business", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State of Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to a party-debt analysis, but not to the contrary to those who wished to eat straw at the next Nochebuena dinner, was regretted by Unostra.
For the OTHER, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions disagree with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the direction of RATP, there was no agreement and trade unions were not satisfied with their bid.
For this important weekend of nave purchases, Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to a train of each two on the central track (between La Defense and Nation) and a train of each four on the other lines.
The connection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Gallerys, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP is trying to provide service to large shops".
The RER A cross from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP route ranges from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one of each of the two trains circled in peak hours, and almost no train in the valley hours, as expected.
On Thursday, there was no disturbance in the Andeans thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competitive than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare Station was not satisfied, SNCF indicated that it had planned the supervision of police and police forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or for its purpose came or shared at Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, "unsatisfying" according to the trade unions, of a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects of RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its proposals between parentheses, noted the CGT angry, noting that the direction "was unable to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of professional practice," RATP specified.
What also led the trade unions to say that the company "did not care about the end of the week".
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee in Paris.
Then the direction, which so far refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents had submitted a warning.
The trade unions are asking for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, 30 of which are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line with a million daily passengers.
The RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, per hour with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the procured party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main procuring party, a decision that immediately provoked anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the government's task, which had just held a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society's party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "the focus of activities that undermined the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the resolution, Kiliç said, and added that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysel Tugluk, were members of political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turkey and Tugluk and the confiscation of the property of the Party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would abandon Parliament before being parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision arises from a proceeding initiated by the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political escape of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and invites the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court takes place at a time when the Government holds hands to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders said that a resolution could generate a rise in tensions in the South-East anatoly, where a large number of demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan's arrest conditions have degenerated in police clashes over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have met in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great care of the South-East population in its majority by Kurds.
The Forces of the Order threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters launched Molotov bombs or rocks with hogs.
In Istanbul, about one hundred people also concentrated.
After the verdict, Turkey stated that the justice decision was going to "deepen the disillusionment".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by solving a party, it said in the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of the parties.
So nothing is solved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
We can of course expect a PKK reaction, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK launched an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
The snow may begin suddenly
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the Director of Road Maintenance in the winter of the ESF
But with this, your employees can learn to test and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
At the end of the week, meteorologists may announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as snow professionally in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called "A" works are out with large vehicles with salt, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the access to the body of bombs, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and we work with hangings, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The ESF service starts around three in the morning
It should cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better adhered to.
That's why the FES starts around three in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins."
The hard thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30 a.m.
"Then we have a problem," said the road maintenance director in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt."
Immediately after, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belong to the Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The last priority is the side and side streets.
That's where trouble is generated, well he knows Brauburger.
Around five o'clock in the morning, the FES infantry is being launched, mainly at dangerous and cruise points.
In general, the ESF could not take charge of all bicycles.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which does not lose sight of the bridges from 22 to 4:30, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become rebalds, the vehicle with salt is launched as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police may also call them.
The wormhole of the dinosaur
The Tawa found it had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal of two feet long and 150 meters high that ran on the two strong back legs, had a long head with twisted and curved teeth, short arms with wooden rods and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa found was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in Ecuador.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, comments Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the genealogical relations, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists launched an excavation in 2006 in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is something unprecedented for Triásico sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the excavating process, the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
A finding confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Great Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Triasic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, comments for example Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to the current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saris were divided into their three most important genealogical lines: the carnivorous thermopods among which are the Tyronasaurus Rex, the Velocioraptor and also the birds, the quadruped saripods known as the "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivorouss (sairs with avian pelvis), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa is a primitive therapist.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa skull, researchers found signs of airbags, such as those that also own the descendents of the theropoids, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the spine were evidently partly full of air.
Tawa is the therapist with older and primitive air bags, comments Randall Irmis.
Due to the fact that the parent line of the later giant suropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, researchers have found that the mushrooms emerged there for the first time.
The three genealogical lines were therefore separated at one start and extended from South America by all the corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a single Earth mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team together with Tawa found the remains of two other not closely related therapists.
The three cannot descend from a single-parent predecessor, the investigators argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were given to North America, comments Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in the present Poland, comments paleontologist Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is only something to discover.
The question of how the dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare line of reptiles to the dominant land vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains a puzzle.
While in Triásico the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and the pterosaurs and many other rats.
Towards the end of the Triasic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and developed many new species, while the parentheses extended to the border of the Triasic towards the Jurasic.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two possibilities to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, an impact of meteorite inhibits the growth of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triaatic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California attend.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt has affected the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with students in protest at the Campus of Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the governing council.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, made the building occupied last week by students and teachers in an educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
Material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and academics by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and turned the content away.
The Governing Council has refused to hold the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand immediate withdrawal of the court claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, they say.
Protégé du protégé
Young people from the Verdi Union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also cooperate with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, comments the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the conduct of the head of the university and police.
We are grateful to the principal of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented in a News Hour issue on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Parliament.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a representative of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the walls painted as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of carefully studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are released.
The Left has submitted a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is requested to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a place heavily guarded for the secret investigation of weapons.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important centres for research and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Strength Cooperation Protocol".
The Vice-Chairman Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the head of Edwin Schwarz planning services.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the research centre of natural sciences will visit a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set a foot on the growing Russian market.
In exchange, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian research firms and institutes.
Among them are the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the great Consortiums Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist planning city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forest mountains, where research facilities were installed.
Stuttgart Frenos
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not set for anything high enough.
For project partners, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
The law is so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region for a decade of irremediable construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brakes for modern rail traffic, as a huge amount of time was needed in ancient times to trap the locomotives from the back.
Ride, stop in the dry, continue the journey; but that's how it should be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passage station, which is approximately half the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, from there they call "Crazón de Europa".
The S21 will really be launched, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Of course, railway terminals also have no more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver car on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new frame built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have done so.
Rail continues, too, because the risks of major individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From a urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain point.
New urban space is created, provided by many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are intended for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge typical growth of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first take care of strengthening the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road vehicles.
However, the new construction works are good for freight trains because of the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavs.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade, the money will be missing in other narrow crossings and passages on the network.
In total, 60 major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres of long cliffs through the Rhine Valley.
The slow-step track has been built since 1987.
It would be urgent here to walk the accelerator as it is due.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The shape of the Rhine valley will be the bottleneck for international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government remains pending in the Wiesbaden autonomous parliament, if it is to submit an appeal to the case concerning the prohibition of night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation of the VGH judgement of more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had based in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the northwest runway planned at Frankfurt airport, the federation would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, if it is to submit the appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticised this postponement and pressured government representatives to renounce appeal before the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their night air traffic ban promises, which they had made before the elections. Otherwise, this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, the head of the Tarek Al-Wazir Greens said, referring to the FDP slogan "We are fulfilling our word".
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federal government would be attempting to obtain its night flights through law disturbances and tricks.
A comprehensive legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick printing".
We need a legally irrevocable decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As the opposition represents, it would never have been the claims of its group on the prohibition of night air traffic.
The U.S. banks return the aid granted.
The large American banks shaken by the crisis are rid of their state attacks.
The Bank of America once returned the aid it had received from the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of EUR 45 billion (approximately EUR 30 billion).
The Citi Group also plans to return State aid, according to a report by the United States CNBC.
With this, the Institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone out of hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had achieved about 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took the box itself, which had plenty of means, among other things for the sale of rubber.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort to absorb the bank's investment in the climate of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to obtain money in the capital market in order to be able to get rid of its obligations in the face of the state.
The CNBC reported from a source of known circles that the U.S. bank could already announce an increase in its capital by $20 billion for Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
In June, they had already returned their aid to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
In the end, everything was faster than it was thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF's administrative board (German TV channel) press the editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present to a successor.
Yesterday night the strike was about to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially in order not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to harm the director of ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not also be approved in the administrative council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs nine of the 14 members of the strike.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the administrative board with his proposal to renew the contract of Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him, and Brender's resignation was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could have been expected.
Because most of the Union in the administrative council had indicated weeks before the election, that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He issued another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument that under Brender's direction the information of the ZDF would have lost hearing indexes.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which he flagged the political influence on the ZDF.
At the end, 35 experts in public law had been involved in the debate, which described the Koch process as unconstitutional.
But he didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, teaching and Roman philology.
He later worked in the Southwest Funk station and in the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 it changed for the ZDF, in principle to the newsletter "heute-journal".
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and manager of the morning program "Mörgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy; since then director of the study of the ZDF in capital.
The Greens political party announced a constitutional claim after Brender's resignation, which was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazine".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the Government of Renania-Palatinate, explained last week that the federations should change the State convention of the ZDF in such a way that the Director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority of them politically motivated.
A withdrawal of party politicians from ZDF control belts was discarded by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized the strike for the resignation of Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence so much Schächter could appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council could vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving him the post to a dry party.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded in all ways to the left-wing liberals.
The university's careers are fired
Part success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers for Education and Culture of the Federal states finally gave up. In a meeting of the Ministers for Education and Culture with university directors, they agreed on both sides to try to improve the study conditions in the case of licensorship and master.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each module of the race should end with a single review.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and it is desirable to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of the results of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states commit themselves to making the structural rules together more flexible for Bachelor and Master races.
Regulations of the federated states that differ from this, should no longer exist.
Less Examines
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers for Education and Culture and university directors have been talking about improving their ability to pursue and successfully complete a career (studiability).
Now for the first time, we talked about a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with one review", says a 30-page document, which intends to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "sensitive reduction in the burden of examinations" aims to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the Director of the Accreditation Board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, the "studiability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be examined in detail with regard to unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to more space, enabling and promoting their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These should be "reaccredited" again every five years, but this would mean that it would take up to 2015 to examine all the races.
This would include 10 accreditation agencies throughout the country, which are under the supervision of the Accreditation Board, which is established by the federation States.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the federations in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of materials and examinations were not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far, only Renania-Platinada has ensured that additional means are provided for further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student tutoring and counselling programs, as well as strengthen examination and external offices.
The Federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a novelty of university law to parliament.
According to it, there should be only one review for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
Until the end of the year next, it is intended to examine all the careers about their "studiability".
This Thursday the government and opposition discussed the conditions of study in the federation.
There were also criticisms of the decisions on the part of praise.
In the federal-level joint directive of the Juso university groups (socialist youth), it required that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "three closed doors" by ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the strikes of education, students as the main stakeholders should now be able to view themselves as well.
The president of the board of university directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: "We need students' experience," said Thursday in a meeting with the Education Ministers, with whom HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) Bonn agreements were not at all sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a later Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study sites for Master with the best possible study conditions. Thus a member of the GEW, Andreas Keller, informed him.
The federal states have to find a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is almost without control," says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner in disbalanced linguistic fragments, in which he discusses the experiences of arrival to Germany experienced by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and later as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded a number of literary awards, in 1993 he gave the memorable lectures or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hesse literature forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said to talk enough last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its security records"
Apparently insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted his participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Security against German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the presenters in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
The recruitment attempts had begun slowly in early 1971.
"That is why I am someone who has not defended himself enough against the attempts to provoke fear of security," Söllner concluded.
lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and its unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania are being shaken by a case that demonstrates the abisms and wickedness of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, therefore, known so far, not only the author, but also the victim.
In his IM Walter security file, the literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive of the IIM Walter.
He had excused or defended him at all the difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Security-Spitzel wesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly " Zeit", after reading his own 914-page file.
Those involved will probably have speculated and in some cases knew what names were hidden behind the seudoonisms of Sorin, Voic and Walter as well.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment of security control files is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A National Council for the Clearance of Records of Security (CNSAS) related to the Birthler Authority was formed in 1999, and the delivery of records since then is better traced.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Security of Temesvar spoke disproportionally of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," at the end she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show without returning in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, there are inevitable questions with the Söllner case, as many times when there are silent blames.
Why right now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be more governed by the anxieties of knowledge, not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genius of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, it is more than just a note at the foot.
The Champions League as a guarantee to fill your stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by a orange plastic bag by the supplier of his team, approached a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, giving the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed outdoor service was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports articles manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the bald characteristic had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
On the other hand, I could also drive the car myself: at the end of the story, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old drunk drunk.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow I'd start work again.
I'd start it for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we have reached the eighth of the end," namely, in the League of Champions, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against the Urziceni Union, Romania, "we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the downfall."
The "more important charge" was waiting for them the following Sunday, he said.
Then it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And remove the weaknesses, which have been clearly shown again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Treäsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort
The eight finals of the League of Champions (ida parties on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return parties 9/10 and 16/17 March) will take place in Nyon on 18 December.
So there was limited joy in the full entrance of the successor of Babel.
Not only in the so-called savior, who had soon inspired Stuttgart's uncertain professions to trust themselves, disposition to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained to the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that so simple sounds, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's partner, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises at football, sometimes things happen that would not have been possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a few weeks' break due to a injury, progressed immediately until he became the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomeno" perceived with the Provial "fresh wind" and the way to work of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what I had obviously missed when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs more than anything.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overestimating the triumph against a defense weakened by lack of reliefs and completely overwhelmed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Levekusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, he thought Kedira.
And director Horst Heldt warned that although a target of the season had been achieved, the other was still very far away.
We're still not over the problem.
That Heldt was not willing to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first victory in his headquarters three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, which were again updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had granted the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that make others, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
This had condemned weakness in the direction of the Governing Council, which had decided to change coach by pressure from adolescent fanatics.
Also that his day was removed after the games called Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt retired, and announced consequences for the latter.
Probably won't be friends forever, the two quarters.
But at least they agreed with all the others in which, without previous efforts with the replacement coach team, the show of great strength of play and battle was not possible.
Babbel and his associates had "an important share in success," said Heldt and Lehmann to the union; and the man in the plastic bag also agreed.
Battle of the world heavyweight championship
Burning duel in Bern: again and again the reactor Kevin Johnson was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judge's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains the world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC Association won the night of Friday in Bern on Saturday to American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the nocque that everyone had expected could not be achieved.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to be won because of his injuries.
Major Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his battle number 24.
Before some 17000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, who had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was once again hiding from the world champion's beatings, so Klitschko could not decisively lead his dangerous right target.
In general, passive Johnson did too little for a retard, and he only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was challenging Klitschko with words and gestures, his strikes rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the battle, the reactor had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie," which "he can't do anything."
In carrying out the heavyweight, the champion was allowed on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from the nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without fighting.
That year he won his title in his defenses to Juan Carlos Gómez, from Cuba, and in September to Chris Areola, from the United States.
In this fight I only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his quick return to the ring.
But your dream remains to gather all four important titles in your family.
Your brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after it destroyed Nikolai Valujev in November of 2.13 metres in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company that promotes it is allegedly planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftists require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent revelations on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), to have deceived him with knowledge of cause.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" broadcast, broadcast by the TV channel ARD, the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "did not know the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he lied.
The killing order would have been issued without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Corps for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report by NATO, which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that in this attack it was not only the attempt to destroy the stolen trucks but also the intention to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy for the intentional murder is part of Afghanistan's federal government's policy, and whether the Chancellor, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Kunast.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
The Saturday had also raised doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details to the Minister.
However, since the two high-ranking officials were surrounded, they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report by a field patrol.
However, Wichert would have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He hasn't received an answer so far, he said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday with regard to the complaints made to it, and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which will be on Wednesday.
Odinic worlds
In a state of surveillance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality are eliminated.
While it happens during the dream, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can give ourselves unhindered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience conditions similar to sleep during surveillance, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are most of the time considered in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in mental illness or drug addicts.
The guilt has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes make the limits between dream, madness and reality be drawn.
The informed state of consciousness that has been changed can appear in the most diverse ways, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castanéda, the state of chamanic possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
Allusions or deliriums arise when the balance of the neuronal communication substances in the brain has been unbalanced – mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear very often.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived the hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of surveillance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 found a "great similarity of the state of madness with the state of honor", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the dispositives, assigned formations, and speculations of it".
This is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is of two dimensions and scandalously colored.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a blow.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mice such as blood, deforming, brushing their teeth.
They're chasing him, they're kicking him with heavy boots, they're throwing him against the walls, he's feeling the pain in the whole body.
Stirring voices and evil resound from the walls and radio.
You can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult them.
Henning T. starts two stereo cables, binds them to form a nozzle, and sets them on a hook on the roof.
It goes up into a box and puts the nude around the neck.
Salta.
The rope goes down.
What a lesson for you!, yells in a choir that returns the timpans, "Go to the clinic and get cured!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
The reason the product was LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizophrenia-affective-paranoid psychosis; it is also maniaco-depressive, taking drugs, anti-depression, mania, schizophrenia.
She's learned to live with her illness, she's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible distress and the deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population fall ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like dream, psychosis also opens the computers to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality of psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the general psychiatric clinic of Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of events, everything has a meaning towards it.
At the same time it comes into a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot be actively organized.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Generally it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Have experienced a hallucination once in life
On the contrary, in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle such."
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are supported in reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers, it's still an unknown thing why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, state of exception can lead any person to lose contact with reality temporarily.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that in addition to genes, there are other determinants.
Researchers assume that the affected suffers from minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain's neural maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
However, it remains unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which has not been shown at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the detonators of a psychosis when there is a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmission system.
When the brain is warmed
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says Psychology Professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
To perceive a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die Irreale Welt in derm Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms associated with psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
Among them are psychotic disorders such as the limited disorder of personality or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranial trauma.
in a surprising way and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are usually repressed.
They occur when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are not stored; when our brain is warmed, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. She was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania West and attended a college of secondary education.
A running girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, a boy has torpedoes with long and dark hair and directs the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit strange, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She wakes up and comes and listens to that boy, just like she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often comes late and is scarce, he cannot discern whether he is awake or dreaming, if the images he sees, the mice or the girl with bloodthirsty cuts in his arms and legs, appear before his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
His parents and friends didn't tell him anything, they'd think he was crazy.
autumn 2009. Sarah K. She is now 20 years old.
He approved selectivity last year and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Dishonesty is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it's the same thing to look for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at 13 years of age, he realized that the man he calls Dad since he uses reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noise impressions, those affected like Sarah K. It is difficult for them to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifys night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends to his patients that they appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Limited situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on consciousness, imaginative experiences are usually pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic of Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease, but it also includes something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called honoraryism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Oniric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers them real and that cannot later differ from being awake.
Conscious states of Ontario arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully aware. die beim Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung are experienced.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world because of a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by a self- and imaginary world that is disconnected from reality.
A limited form of situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way to give sense and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own capacity to create enables us not to sink into anything of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, also describes his unique experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an act of life-saving.
He was 49 years old when his conscience sailed several days after an operation of heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was sentenced to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen dived into a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he was laid in bed, a bigger man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watched for his health.
He was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his country of origin, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snowflakes and met with a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
More clear and intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, honesty, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show the fragileness of the inner reproduction of external reality, even when we are awake.
Each change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The Snow Can Come
Burda
Children will be charged with the editorial at 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the hands of his two children in the future, said SPIEEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at 27 years of age and have a strong will to enter the company, Burda, 69 years of age, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
Details have been adjusted as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they're trained for it.
One can't put 7,500 workers in front of his children, unless they're trained enough to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the presidency of the board of directors and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of the Burda leadership since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took care of the treasure and thus came to responsibility for the company's heritage. After the release of Jürgen Todenhöfer, he was also responsible for direct marketing, foreign printing, and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family takes charge of the editorial.
The sons of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a view to the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family companies are not safe from the decadence either: "This has always affected families that are infected by the capital search affair, who have been misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "great delights," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political precept in this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league; these business has become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything - in the matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within the reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte English, which has just opened in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and limb of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Taci peluqueros; Marina d'Or, which has a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teterium is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes than this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the unparalleled views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a champagne cup are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total, 250 m2 is distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, corporal and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide customers' steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key into a touchscreen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles in the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through hairdressing, the firm Luis & Taci has a room where rituals of hair recovery, lightness or nutrition are offered in a personal way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the assumptions of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Miscellaneous Scores
It's close to Christmas and it's never going to look at the stars again to adapt them to our party dress.
The shape of the escort, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to take into account.
There are a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an excessive and very complicated escort. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The company Endesa, together with the City of Barcelona, has created the 'Live Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Installation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to push forward what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric Cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville joined the project.
It is the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generality of Catalonia.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has assets in a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquillity' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, views "a horizon of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled is the country's main exporting sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures taken by the Executive during the course of the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a view of abandonment, of closing some of our main production plants," the president of the government explained.
"Thanks to this plan and the availability of the following brands in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can have a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including in the Integrated Automotive Plan (IPA), targeted 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliaries, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Chief of the Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's demand support measures, in line with Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and has resulted in a "strong increase" of registrations, which grew "40 per cent" in November.
20.000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Room of the Classic Vehicle will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the mountain of the engine.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, there are accessories, replacements, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, thumbnails, etc. among the exhibitors of the pavilion.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies are classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restaurant; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restaurant; or Classics Car, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Tests of external competence
In addition, the commercial activity of this Chamber will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Evidence of skill with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out in a circuit enabled outside the ferry station.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sport is not abandoned with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the system of stopping and starting the engine -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that is at least currently only available with the 2.0 gas engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 highlights the good note reached throughout its whole.
The finishes, the end of the vehicle, the habitat, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driving position, we check that the front pockets present excellent ergonomics and subjection.
Also, the touch of the wheel is exquisite.
Following the set formed by the frame of instruments and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and blue and red calling colors.
This style reminds us, in part, of what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically Volkswagen Golf, to which they all want to beat.
Continued with the habitat, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitat for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is combined with a wide and regular suitcase.
The engine stop and automatic start system, at least for the moment, is only available with two litres gas engine and 150 horses and with the manual change of six marches.
This engine is a real delight. It is great for its fineness, for its low noise, for its benefits, and for its consumption.
And it is that although the most demanding Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not realize a large number of kilometres per year should not discard this i-stop with a petrol engine, both because of their high comfort of departure, and because of their content consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the selected version for the test is called Sportive, which includes a larger number of serial elements.
The series equipment especially highlights the car exchange assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth and 17-inch alleviation wires.
In addition, because of its little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: Bixenone adaptive lamps and BOSE sound system with disc chargers, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It highlights in particular the quality of the materials employed, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not realize many kilometres per year can choose from this version i-Stop, only associated with the engine of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 of the Luxury finish and €23,2,270 of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
'Premier' luxury
L. A. covers the red sensuality carpet of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars shined more than ever in elegant models like 'sexys' on the Nine outside. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly rate, less than half of what is paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
Because of the success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free life data service instead of paying six times more for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as your American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to have to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be running.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but my experience requires a physical doctorate to understand them and some good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission's repeated ear shootings to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe have only had a perceived effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (do not stop being curious that brings the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of tariffs means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including the traffic of downloading books and other online consultations.
No contracts and no tickets.
It's a connected device and it's paid for buying it, not a month.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a life-access option like Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so, because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The Fetic Color of Michelle
The yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If you have already come to Barack Obama's take as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany you in, no doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -green yellow with brilliant reflections-, the two times the acting consisted of three pieces - woven, jacket and cover of the same screen-, and was adorned with a large edge or collar.
It is so, that at first sight it seemed that the first lady in the United States followed the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat clothing.
But the screen on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the taking of possession of a fat fit, in Oslo it is a three-piece printed.
The plugins have also varied: green shoes of half-takon again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the painting: a collection on this occasion, the melon drops the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had job problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is how the study 'Facundity and Working Travel of Women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women, reveals this.
The survey conducted between 9,737 women aged 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the labour field due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of the life of couples and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a unstable job, start life together first, move forward with the first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, are lagging behind in life and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"The women between 35 and 49 years of fixed employment have the first child, of average, 3.7 years after the start of life, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed jobs have taken longer of their vital journey to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity, even less on the schedule of compensation," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that distinguishes the age of women when we get married and when we have the first vow.
According to the survey, the greater the educational level, the greater the age they marry and the greater the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who have elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is also another division among women based on their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, middle or upper levels invest this sequence and give priority to getting a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different products from the brand, immersing the universal motto of 'Because I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actors in the international panorama, joins in this way other famous figures of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('los') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangelical companion in 'lost').
British Fashion Prizes
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met at the annual award delivery, which was held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the date.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
The Poker by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty radiographs of writers who have passed through their literary life (and, in cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in predictable and scary genres (biographical, life and work) but looking for something similar to the core of the creative character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent does not save shocks or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you a few minutes here.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulse, almost physical, the same that I felt without name: the pleasure against the axiodo fate, moral guilt and innocence without any gods."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with an amazing poetic humor, without meaning, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was overwhelmed by this woman with a passion that lasted for 13 years, in which her flesh combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of the eight thousand metres of universal literature, which has to climb through the north wall, from which the best climbers are once again cast off."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he used to say that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and others who was the son of a black man and a cocodrel.
Both dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer gathered the demented cry from a bridge by that character of Munich to take his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and made it on a journey running from himself and calling for the posteriority with a violent speech to the pigs."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he knelt down and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these verses of Spencer were recorded: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the hard life pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband readily accepted that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
The case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness has never been given."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Bennett try to do but go to Baroja for the Faulkner weapons?
What did Cela do but bring the man's fame to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Cobard Aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years passed through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed to her and to our dog, a mesesy specimen, rescued from the dog and with no more than six pounds of weight and, without a word, drank two ducks that left the wounded dog.
Our indignation is majestic because we do not find the fun in a free assault on a small and defenseless animal, which was, by the way, attached.
To this we need to add the emphasis that caused a woman who walked quietly and that, when she caught up with these individuals, she became afraid of her physical integrity, since an energetic person who attacks an animal is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder, or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that it works for a long time and not generate susceptibility, just to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Anger has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to abuse a defenseless animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmet, especially among the younger motorists, today informed both entities.
This initiative seeks to be aware of the importance of using helmet, as it is the only protection element capable of preventing head injuries or, even, death in the event of an accident while driving.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "go beyond to design and manufacture products every day safer", and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmet in the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of two-wheeled tyres, one of its main purposes is to develop more and more safe products.
Raise the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent a 12.6 per cent increase in 2008 and, most importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of descent, according to the figures of the Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam vendors.
The good data, not ossifying, should be put in quarantine as the reference to which the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decline in the previous year.
The result is that, despite the last month's resumption, the accumulated registrations in these 11 months are 40% below those in the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together all the vehicles that make up the rod of light commercials: tourist derivatives, pick up, vans, light vans and trucks/light chassiss.
Moreover, the cloudheads that most affect their demand have not disappeared, since although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Thus, restrictions on the closure of bank credit must be added to other factors such as the increase in unemployment rates or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this view and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has recently been used.
They can be accepted, in addition to the individuals, the autonomouss and the SMEs that are going to acquire a light trade of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testified.
Yesterday, from Ganvam, they again recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles and buses.
The association of sellers predicts a 2010 similar to the end of the year, for which a decrease in sales (from tourism and 4x4) is estimated at 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with the ABS brake block and the ESP stability control, emergency brake support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all light commercial tourism and vehicles of new enrolment, while for the rest there is a period of shortage until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, in its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions in scope.
The emergency brake assistant does what it does to increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the piloton that gives the driver.
But this doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to tread the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one out of every four sinesters would be avoided with damage to persons - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and alerts the driver, as well as acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors late until January the plan for Opel
While Opel plant workers in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on the 8th - as Javier Ortega reports, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, claims is that each of the points in the plan has been previously consensused by the affected party.
And this can make the final document to be submitted to the workers first and then to the Governments of the countries in which there are factories fall back to the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, from GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be made in the next few days.
This is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows to contact some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes strength from the Dutch manufacturer's choice of Skype sports cars, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to Baic China.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if it is not sold.
On the wheel of Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to develop its last, and face-to-face, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to reach no less than 80 kilos, which has left the bascule in only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to ignore, first of all, the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of the wires with manual action, saving 21 kg; using aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air-conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel storage from 64 to 54 litres, they gained 7 more pounds; mounting sports backpacks from other 12 and with light 19 inches, five.
Finally, abandoning the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door-to-door shooters by one of the screens, the remaining kilos.
Although it is also offered with the exchange of double deck PDK, the test was carried out on a unit with the manual six-speed box, mainly by secondary roads of California, in mountain tracks with truly reversed trails
Its behavior can only be described as irrevocable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not climb the asphalt with aplome.
Rather, all the contrary: it was time we didn't test a model so small and so light that at the same time, it would transmit so much security in the step by the curve, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short walk during the time necessary, until we order him to blow, slow, recover and express his engine again...
What we're asking you to do, thanks to your address, as precise as possible, what we say with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a surgical precision.
Engine sound on will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's brake, already excavated earlier in the Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether from the stop or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was pretty punished, but the car said the bays well.
Electronic aids only made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and heavy, well into the morning.
Finally, an ultralight car, of the most fun driving you can drive on the market and it's more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70,831.

Basconia’s Victory in Israel
The Laboral Box achieved a brilliant triumph for 82-91 in its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electro cup, despite the numerous lowers with which the Dusko Ivanovic team was counted, and thus is located in the leadership of its group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which with eight triples was the best of its team (29 rating).
The Victorian team was expected to supplement the major absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the big acre from the perimeter, with 16 triple notes had much to see in the final triumph.
The party started face-to-face for the blues, which were placed from the beginning in the marker.
That the first four cans of the Victorians were from the perimeter already presage that they had jumped into the Israeli cage with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artifacts from 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second room was more of the same, but the Alavese team opted for Barak's internal game and Elijahhu's work, which was received with pies and applause at the return to which his home was, to continue to extend his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less than six' rating had already assumed that it would not be the best night in Brazil.
But the party, despite being bound to rest, was not determined nor much less, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the victoriouss that in their chest they did not gain any, and with 'Elijah'' pressing their hand they managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the return to the light (50-49).
More Inconvenient
Ivanovic's wounded, but not much less dead, needed a pair of playful games to catch air, and in them came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a calming rent (54-67), which they managed to make the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alaves left the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated due to faults, Ivanovic's men did not hurry, defended well, and although the Israelites approached in the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the battle of Unicaja
The Unicaya lost in Greece to the Olympics and gave it the leader of Group B of the Euroliga, in a party marked by the downfalls of the cashiers, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not afraid of the environment of the Peace and Friendship pavilion, nor of the rival entity, perhaps of Europe's most powerful and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed to dream of the Andalusia. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of the Omar Cook base and one of Guillem Rubio, set off at 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave back to the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, a combat count, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, subjected to the decalation of both players.
The Greek group began to function by showing its superiority in both areas, where the lower loss of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were laundering the cashiers.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible to retrieve
The third period was very offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown to be higher and even equalized the difference between the encounter in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which would cause the group's leader to be beaten.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last downfall of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences, the Unicaya by the direction and triples of Cook, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics, when they reached and gave their superiority in centimeters within the area, proved to be impermissible.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to lift the basketball verage 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja turned off, handing the leader over to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with a higher number of classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 employment offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must enter your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the searcher has detected that in general the Spanish worker "is feeling unremunerated", explained in a communiqué the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data provided by Trovit of its searchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges EUR 45.226 per year and a French, 31,059, against the 24,000 receiving Spanish.
Similarly, a driver charges EUR 34.247 annually net in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of the chamber, with 11,592 euro per year net; followed by the dependant, with EUR 14,725; and by the operator, with EUR 15,667.
The most sought-after jobs in the network in the last three months are driving, working on average and working on a social worker.
Brazil puts date on Zelaya exit
The Brazilian Government has put the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President shall leave the diplomatic connection by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when he will officially complete his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, a business manager of the Embassy of Brazil in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, at the end of his term of office, he has to look for another destiny."
The station also quoted the former director, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which he became elected Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the state of political asylum which the "real" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since the past spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant tonic in the markets, once again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilise markets was to lend directly to the purchase of assets and indirectly to free liquidity at zero rates so that financial institutions would buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they start to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
The volatilitys of the Bags and the differentials of corporate bonds have reappeared, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risks and public debt again became affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differences in the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this episode of instability, but in that it arrived Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision to the low rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that there is no harm in raising moral risk advocates who have tried again to raise awareness about world economic policy leaders because they have stopped the destructive effects of credit restrictions on the destruction of employment, when a new day of thank-you action is to be made.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that conceals public deficit, elections and a new government that withdraws from the roof.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from a failure to comply with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro-member country to fail to fulfil its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for special measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some overruns in balanced positions, it would be within the expected range.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt are widening the same as European corporate bonds we should not worry about.
If European differentials decline and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiopathic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing the majority of study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their stage up for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are back in charge with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, it does not expect much hope of life to be warned.
Again, it has all the painting that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "wisdom, friend driver".

The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Congress's subcommission of Members in which the energy strategy of Spain is being discussed today in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a brush of what he had put in the subcommission at the closed door.
For President Iberdola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another 6 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments will not be of 6 billion but of up to 95 billion.
Yes, Iberdola considers that in the next decade investments should not be intended to increase capacity in generation but in distribution networks and in international interconnections
As of 2020, the issue changes and the power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the Government has just adopted is in line with what its company has been claiming, did not want to bleed with the real decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the President of Iberdola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although in the long term, must begin to take place, as they are already slowing down and a stable payroll framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Air Lingus' action in ten airports
The Ferrovial branch for ground airport services, Switzerland Swissport, will play the preferred partner role of the Irish Aeroplane Air Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not exceeded the economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The partnership includes an investment of 20 million up to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the work of the centre will investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Action disputes your first highway in Australia with Hochtifif and Bouygues
Action fights for its first concession highway in Australia, the market in which it already works as an energy company and a water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at $1,700 million in Australian dollars (about €1,047 million).
French Bouygues and Sister Hochtif are their rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Action to sit in the country as a builder and concessionary of highways.
The City Council wants to keep it up to date by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP for its English-language stamps) to move forward the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do the work and exploit the payroll.
While waiting for them to submit their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to $1,70 billion in Australian dollars (EUR 1,047 million) and, in the final phase, three consortiums with a significant presence of European builders.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Actionona, the only Spanish in lise, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, settled in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Actiona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the crib is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Lighton (the subsidiary of the German builder Hochtifif, in turn participated in the ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala signature specialized in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it leads to a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction signature.
A strategy that has followed the Hochtif or Bilfinger quotes, in addition to Asian references, and continues to be a pending assignment for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% participation in Hochtifif, owner of the mentioned Lighton.
Million assets
It acts by a geographical area of utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as a supplier of energy and in the business of eviction.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing Adelaida's eviction, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the infrastructure construction and operation fields.
The underground pedestrian route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (north link), is called for connecting Toowong's western highway with the circular road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the biggest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane's traffic.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the launch of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two carriages per purpose, electronic pay system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane offers business in Hochtifif
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtifif, which announced yesterday that a contract with the Government was awarded in 154 million.
The ACS participant will enable, through its local Leighton branch, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with optical fibre cable.
This action will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to Germany for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed over the construction project of the King George Tower, of 27 plants, in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still about to begin and Hochtif closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, you will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine branch, has been awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 kilometres in length for a Slovenian highway of EUR 64,5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after it is done with the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
Thus, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services to Mrs Rushmore for the next two years for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract collects the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA, who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Lots of 63 million to France Telecom to stop competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Telecom for anti-competitive behaviours in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited fixed and mobile telephony competition with the signature of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes to consumers beyond regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still the state company have accumulated more than €560 million in fines since 1994 to put their competitors to work.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore recurring.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch has followed the star of other operators and has opened a web app store to increase the incomes that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange’s application shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Play the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Both that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since, which makes them the third and fifth clubs that have won more money in the competition.
The list leader is Manchester United.
The list leader is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from the major clubs.
So, the competition has distributed EUR 5,362.5 million to 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well out of this department.
The White Club has been the third of the continent that has been paid more money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extended European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern in Munich, the two teams that also made more money to participate in the last League of Champions.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, Michel Platini's body plans to enter 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-classification round (including the Madrid Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received 3.8 million just because they were there, plus another 550,000 euros for each party they dispute.
There are also bonuses for winning (€800,000) and for hiring (400,000 for each team) octave finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million finalists.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, was paid 2.5 million for winning the Europe Summit in August.
But there are also variable payments to which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main, and has four seats assigned.
The previous year's champion remains with 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party shall be paid in accordance with the number of parties played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group yesterday described the details of the offer of purchases of shares with which it pursues to acquire a peak of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for the whole of the securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for action that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest in this deferral of 1% annually
Sos's shares closed at 1.85 euros yesterday; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company as 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects Sos' real valuation.
The offer is conditional on the designation of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerezano group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling titles.
The CNMV made sure it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If this was done, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos' capitalization was 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to remain in the range of possible purchase offers and the judicial waves of their former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordà as director of internal audit.
A decision to turn it into the first woman to hold a high office in the food business.
This is a new establishment that will depend directly on the president of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company continues to engage in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it can't be discarded that over the next few months His will unveil new fund fluctuations
Regarding the credit to Salazars, the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) declared yesterday in the National Hearing and claimed that they had approved the 212 million deviation without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorizes the fatherly exclusion uncle who presented Investor Mer
The National Market of Values Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion of the veil presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this operation when it understands that its terms are in accordance with the applicable rules and considers the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is directed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares by Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 per cent of its social capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiations in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the provisions of the current legislation.
New tools to test cars
In these days of time and accidents, not only do they win car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered from a sinister are removed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No sinister is equal, and the calculation of the cost of parts and the working time can be a long and complicated work.
The cost of repairing between €20,000 and €30,000, including workpieces, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent IT tools, it would be a minor issue
Thus, almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for the evaluation of sinisters and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided to them by manufacturers, and then to developing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solar Group, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
The other firms that compete in the field of charging and processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, Spain works with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed does not cease to increase, to the point that in the last five years there have been two versions, different modulators than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car leaves the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and enter your price.
In addition, each model takes place a "intelligent" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "twisted".
If it is a valve model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Auditex has full information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that runs, they exceed 99 per cent.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of databases, Auditex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Auditex invests EUR 90 million per year in the development of these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries also have tools for handling parts of waste or to calculate the venous or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of the users in Spain is Eurotax.
Auditex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the AudaPlus star product, the standard sinister valuation solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the pieces, include the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for low-use customers, up to 10 times a month.
After each insurance company, which carries out thousands of searches, negotiates its price with Audetex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its trailer number.
AudaGlass concentrates on the months of vehicles, and AudaSubbastas is an open service to the professional online sector that allows you to climb by the declared vehicles total sineiro.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know deviations by homodole marks.
For example, how many models of a particular brand have been through the workshop due to failures or how many serious sinisters have suffered over a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It commercialises, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions to the damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Tax Guide is your historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased at a rate of 20 per cent per year in the last three years, and in 2008 it invoiced 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, their internationalization process began, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, an additional 3.3 per cent in 2008.
In our country, the company will enter EUR 19.1 million, a 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion in Bolsa, and now its shares amounted to a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed cars
Last October, the Solara group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars as motorcycles or special vehicles Signed.
The transaction was paid out of EUR 59.5 million by 85% of the capital of society, which could be extended by the next 15% year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, deficits and professional sellers who must register before they start operating.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The web currently has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.

Four-step workshop budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audetex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the replacement, creating a budget and generating a budget.
The ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals that to a greater or lesser extent they are more responsive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 landowners, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with Internet connection is needed to use it.
Once the model has been identified to repair by its number of builders, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the labor hand, recharge or discount, and then you can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this workshop tool is 350 euros a year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, the Audetex company is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics come with very good eyes, as it will, for example, allow you to select a door and give it back to see the inner face.
