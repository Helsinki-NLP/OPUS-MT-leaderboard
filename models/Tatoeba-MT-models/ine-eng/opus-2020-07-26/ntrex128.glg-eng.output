The members of the Gales Assembly are concerned that they take them for moncrats.
Consensus among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, is the suggestion that they should change the name of the MWP (Member of the Gales Parliament).
The debate took place on plans to change the name of the assembly by the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid of being ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the new name "Rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "stupid" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of Plaid Cymru's party showed that the group's set "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but stressed that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is spoken in a similar way to the English word "u" in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the changes in the name, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Gales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed much support for the name of the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the Commission preferred members of the Gales Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which he is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules on the disablement of the AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians welcome the urns in referencing to change the country name
The voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to settle a dispute that has lasted for decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens took a long time insisting that the name of its North neighbour represents a claim from its territory and repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he would make an omission of the vote.
However, the rapporteur's advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change of name is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's camps keep quiet while Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that there was once a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one thing nor the other."
He said he could understand that the bars would disappear.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood to which people usually go."
As for churches, fear that the money from the sale of assets doesn't last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they'll come back where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartments with communities full of owners of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation changed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation was formed next to the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the streets of 125th Street, a trade street in Harlem that was able to hire and climb black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as the frugs of Johnson's father made plans to rebuild it, they took care of the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of the father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the cartoon as "the camps of the poor."
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the first carillon of the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who take care of St. Martin over the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the bishop diocese.
The parish council, the organ that reigns over the parish and which is composed of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing his concern that the latter "is likely to affect the costs" together, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some frescoes complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark hits a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing submarine fishing in search of langostas in California on the first day of the season of that cruise.
The attack occurred just before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that it was about half an hour walking with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help with the screams, when he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only an emotion to fish a langota, but that he soon realized that he was shouting, "I was being worked!
I've been hired!'
Hammel said he noticed when the boy arrived.
"I'll take everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transferred to a helicopter at the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical state.
Unknown type of shark responsible for the attack.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they divided a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they found it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma damage at the top of the tower.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, to Swami's, to Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to those of the great stores full of specialists' assistants.
As part of the considerable market in the UK's beauty market, which rises to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow as fashion sales fall and home products fall, the biggest racers with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and then pass to others next year if they are successful.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the booths that on their day occupied TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products to reach 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those you can see in tents like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something more and more charged by the newest customer.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will prove concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops implies that supermarkets need to do more to convince people that they are visiting them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that the establishments will increasingly look like malls, because supermarket chains are trying to compete with discount shops like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's already introduced sales points of Argos and Habitat in hundreds of tents, as he bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its departments of pharmacy and beauty was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute about how to distribute pharmaceutical revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business consisting of 281 tents in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to adapt to all needs and attractive and practical locations means that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old purchasing habits."
Peter Jones "further" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, went "furnished" after the TV show Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
His company was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning used Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones throwing sparks when he withdrew from his lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "furnished" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that he had no time to dedicate himself to the brand of household clothing and accessories of both, True.
The business came to compare with Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving True, Jones took a plane to Britain and addressed one of his holiday residences.
One source said, "Truly was different from one of Holly's priorities.
It would be your long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left an atoned for all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this morning's presenter is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products from coxines and candles to clothing and textiles for home, and that it could even delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
The couple were together on vacation, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter in the ITV I'm program to Celebrity.
A source near Jones declared last night that "We shouldn't comment on his business affairs."
A complicated conversation "and then we fall in love"
He played with the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "a few of his own presidents" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said putting his voice on "telegrapher."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after his first meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considered a great step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearization have stopped.
More than three weights after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see the "responsible" by the US to the first measures to disarmament in North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his half speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: ending tests with missiles, helping free hostages and returning home to the remaining U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said signaling to the crowd that he was right in front.
An earthquake and tsunami devastated an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they would not ask for international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it's not clear if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a member of the national disaster management agency, has ensured that Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is very badly prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although in Aceh shelters were built for tsunamis, it is not usual to find them on the other side.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best case, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was highlighted in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake will go to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around the improvement of damaged Indonesia's infrastructure, and produced money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line to re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the target of the empatt in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in minute 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri, still about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball with his left leg before firing a shot at the second pole.
The balloon flew over the area as it headed toward the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over a Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped in the air and entering the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball as hard as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"Come to Kante and give me a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The Blue Forwarder passed the ball of talent to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before he turned close to the middle of change and ran into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful deep passage leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up in the second suit marking with a gunshot that Alison Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool is in front of Naples in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do her own thing with Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of fatal Tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to the National Disaster Management Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the ruins of the buildings that came down with the magnitude earthquake of 7.5 occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press conference, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old murder suspect after a woman died in a hospital.
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning with white gun wounds on John Street, and was arrested by a 32-year-old murder suspect.
The police asked the people in the area to see or hear something about it one step ahead.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I'd like to make a call to get in touch with us anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street at Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the cab drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the controls that comes in contact with us, as they could have key information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbour of Birkenhead who was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they're in the process of informing the family of the victim's most close relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that they wouldn't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again within hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman on the scene crying.
Don't stop saying 'it'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the line with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
To anyone who has information, you are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to anonymously contact Crimestoppers on the number 0800 555 111 by quoting the record 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects from England carried out by his fanatic and puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disappear" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became a goal.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe they would have sacrificed Cromwell mistakenly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith stated to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the object of a continuous historical debate.
What's clear is that the 17th-century media conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents one side of the division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A pig killer snuck a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
Last Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his name, "Yuan," was found dead with a blood artery sectioned and covered near a cut in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou.
A fat pig prepares to put the vaccines on pigs in a cutlery on May 30th and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently she traveled with her cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him another adjacent cut.
He said there was a big man in the cutlery with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, about 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
"My cousin had his legs bleeding and sneezing," said the cousin, called "Wu," to the Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they're not very common, there have been cases of pigs that attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig about 300 kilos rushed a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs do not usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "dispatcher.
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the respect you need," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it exceeds the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains to the north of Mexico and to the south-west of the United States during the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, in the east, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wave begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east towards the east coast of the United States. As Rosa reaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture toward the north, which will penetrate south-west of the United States.
Rose will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valley will create abundant and generalized rains in the south-west in the next few days.
At the local level, precipitations of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, fluctuations and the possibility of land spills in the desert.
The large tropical humidity will cause precipitations that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the south-west, rain is expected from 50 to 100 l/m2, especially on much of Arizona.
Possibilities of sudden flooding with deterioration conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and the electric storms will bring local cold winds and dust.
The valley will bring strong rains locally to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitations could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of smaller debris and svaradas roads.
These would be the first rains of the region's wet station.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The abundant rain will reach Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will be a witness of large temperature oscillations in the United States due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes involves significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we will see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the U.S. center.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm October start is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the south-east plains to the north-east.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people on six television channels followed the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a new last Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, so the FBI can conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he's a hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh made his toys drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a party at the institute.
In a loving witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
Nielsen reported Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company reported the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other chains that retransmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching television from offices.
To make an idea, it's a hearing similar to that of a football final or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was a second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on TV.
After the office of the moderate Republican had made a statement indicating that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, it was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, being supported by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator on his way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stayed with his eyes down for several minutes while he was being arrested, television live at CNN.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator closed, added that he would have more to say in committee hearing.
All television and cable chains were broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to move forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said that he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the appointed week, something that called for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that the Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critic of abandoning the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and to prejudice national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
Another interview with him on the cover of the paper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the tariffs from the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murdered: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect to carry out the shootings that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU (state University of Louisiana).
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, he was arrested and imprisoned for murder in second degree.
Officials released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims would lose his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glass from the scene and said they contain Simpson's DNA, according to the affiliated CBS channel, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was charged with a $350,000 loan.
The Office of the Forensics of the East Baton Rouge parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department commended the unit of fugitives from the state police in Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police is to the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local forces for their "difficulty and seeking justice".
Yes, he was 20 years old.
The 2,01 wing was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played the basketball for the LSU.
Its average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 turns.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said the team was "suffered" and "smoked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we care about all the time," Wade said.
Sulphur-like volcano on Mexico City
The ashes that rock the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to leave the volcano on Saturday after they detected activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several shocks and tremors.
The images of the social networks showed fine layers of ashes in the suburbs of Mexico City neighborhoods like Joachimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano 72 kilometres west of the capital since a magnitude earthquake of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Coping between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators faced the anti-disruption police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of proseparatists masked by police anti-disturbing gunshots eggs and paint in dust that created dark clouds in the streets that usually be haunted by tourists.
There were also colds later that same day with the police, who used the bastards to hold the bull.
For several hours, pro-independent groups that co-ordinated "Nor forgotten nor forgiveness" were confronted by Unionist protesters who called out "Long Life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be cared for by minor injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the skin flower in the independent region one year after the referendum of October 1st celebrated by the Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted out in a comprehensive manner for independence, although the participation was low and the opposition to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at electoral tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
Proindependent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration was also produced, but they were forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who went to the independent demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would achieve independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I have seen my parents cry with joy when they are able to vote, but now we are adjourned," he commented.
Despite gaining an adjusted victory, although decisive, in the regional elections of last December, this year the Catalan proindependent parties fought to keep the momentum, with many of their most known leaders in self-imposed exile or held in waiting for trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by both gang politicians.
"There is more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the European Parliament.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: they arrest a man after a car stops at a house
three men 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car stopped on several occasions against a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
The police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings has declared the siege and the building in itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a fight against the car was fired at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingstone a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston is to win
The rising Livingstone surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second victory in 18 games as an instructor of the Ibrox club.
The goal of Dolly Menga was decisive for Gary Holt's team to meet a level after the hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they're facing the leader, the Hearts, from which they're divided by eight points.
But sooner the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
However, Livingstone continues to be indicted in the division by the sixth consecutive party; the main coach, Holt, still doesn't know the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller with me.
Livingston leaves opportunities in front of weakened visitors
Holt's team had to move far ahead before they marked, as with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way but his cross-shoot did not cross the threshold of the gate; next, Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors at risk in the ball games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers granted a free shot and Livingston carried out a bag in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who hit the balloon and scored from the center of the area.
At that time, Rangers dominated possession but met with an impenetrable defense that prevented much work from being done by Guardian Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
The Rangers' wardrobe, Allan McGregor held a shot at Scott Pittman's feet, and Lithgow sent the ball out another shot at Livingston's stop ball.
Many crossings in the Livingston area were produced that were continuously dissipated, while two requests for penalty were rejected: one by hand and one by Halkett's entry to the Glenn Middleton replacement.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
And unitedly, they were excellent and still surpassing expectations in their ascending path.
Your game style and players have only changed since you returned to the maximum category, but part of the merit is Holt in the way you have driven the team since your arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, led in a proud way a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave them no breath at all to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under the order of Gerrard, on this occasion they did not reach that level.
Last pass failed. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. All of a call for Rangers, which is found in half of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO's allies.
They focused on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan directed Colony to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to receive them in the country.
The grief of demonstrations reflects the division in front of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a collision that saw a car surrounded in London.
The accident took place close to the cross between the Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a transited street in Deptford, on the west side of the city, about 10:15 a.m. (Summer Time in Great Britain).
The car driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died in a crash on Childers Street at a little over a mile and a half of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police revealed that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been turned away, and they are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers are injured in disorders
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security prison under the terms of the prison officer.
The disturbance started at Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin around 09:30 (summer time in Britain) on Sunday and continues.
A "Tronado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the disturbances, in which eight prisoners are involved who are contained in a pavilion.
Officials received attention for slight injuries in the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "The prison staff was particularly trained to deal with an ongoing HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six staff members had to be cared for by injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we're clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars."
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was known that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disruption officers had to go to prison to calm down a revolt in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by the drought could benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is very likely that it will occur early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa passes through the South-West Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued emergency flood alerts for Mondays and Tuesdays from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the west coast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and that the last hour of Monday with rain will come.
Phoenix's National Weather Service reported on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-mile-long radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that stretched on a 64-mile radius of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with quantities isolated up to 150l/m2 on the Mogollón Board of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Grand Conca could reach 25 or 50 liters, with possible totals of 100 l/m2.
For those outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, for the region is deeply affected by the droughts.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dry, the second largest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will play ground on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have the force of hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing power.
For this reason it is hoped that it will touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at night of Monday.
It could rain very heavily in some areas of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"A total precipitation of between 75 and 150 l/m2 is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2", reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then she will continue going up across Arizona and enter south of Utah the last hour of the night of Tuesday.
"The main danger of Rosa or what is left of her is the strong rainfalls in Lower California, north-west of Sonora and the South-west Desert of the United States," the National Center of Furacáns reported.
It is hoped that these rains can cause sudden water drums and streams of debris in the deserts, and earthquakes in mountainous lands.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he stays "stable."
According to Somerset's police, three 17-, 18- and 20-year-old boys were arrested in Radstock's area during the night.
Officials asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the mobile of the event.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh ‘suffered the mosque and the wrath’ of the Democratic Party
"Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the insulted and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the mosque and the wrath" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he categorically refused and emotionally charged Christine Blasey Ford with assaulting her sexually decades ago, being a teenager.
Ford also testified in the trial on his indictment.
The president said Saturday that that day the "US" were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and bravery.
"A vote to confirm the judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best lawyers of our times with a history of implicit public service," he said, addressing the crowd of admirers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the Republican results in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't do it, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the democratic mission is to "oppose and hinder".
It is expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh took place before Friday, according to CNN an assistant of the Republican Party.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to rise
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke down on the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke down on the ground to the Luccofusco, leading the lives of many and destroying everything to its step.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat came, people were still with their activities on the beach and they did not run away immediately, so they fell dead," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a prison ring in Iacarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, pulled cars, trunks, houses, pulled everything I found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami ran high at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs spread by the national disaster management agency showed a lot of destroyed tents and buildings, torn bridges and broken bridges and a water-round mosque.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was located in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals and hotels came down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, a zone called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the seismic.
The communications remained "totally paralyzed and no information" by Dongala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were on their way to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticised on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves would arrive at the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a lover shared on social networks, you can hear a man sitting on the last floor of a building shouting out in a frenzy warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people on the street.
In the matter of minutes the water shocks against the shoreline leading in front of buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the writing immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an important closure that led to the cut-off of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
The authorities state that the army has already begun to send cargo aircraft from Iacarta and other cities, but the evacuation continues to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The victim balance of Indonesia's tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that World Vision staff traveled to the city of Palu, where the employees retreated into shelters of wool raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of launching disaster assistance, some complained that they were preventing Paul from travelling to foreign humanitarian aid workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only fluctuate if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a voice from the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'All right, this is a national disaster,' we can open up to international aid, but it hasn't yet reached that time.
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, family and friends of the disappeared were caught in the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that alleviated the depressing argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday they took out a kid from a dumpster.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandano, a trainer of the national Indonesian parapent team, trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandadi added that some of the people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel were their students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the parapentist community, he desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival
However, only one grey mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Roban $26,750 while reloading a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who recharged a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
In the press note, researcher officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car emptied a boxer in the leisure complex and was prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole him a purse of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not realize how much they were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about your identities, contact the Newport police, calling number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West takes over the name of Y
Master Kanye West changes the name for Y.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be previously known as Kanye West."
For some time now, the 41-year-old West is known as the nickname Ye, which used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled his assistance for "emotional reasons", according to the program's creator.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," said that same year West while talking about his record with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I have passed from Kanye, which means the only, only Ye, which is a reflection of goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous boys who changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, even though this year he announced he prefers to call him Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, was also shown by putting and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMLO undertakes not to use military against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Workers, committed to not again using military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against the students arrives.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "he would not use the military again to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when the student movements were invading all over Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double investment in US
According to the investor and professional of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who is married to Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S. should double the amount you invest in IA in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about IA, even if the U.S. lacks a formal strategy about IA.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the number 1 in innovation in IA in 2030.
"Dublining the budget for research in IA would be a good start, as the other countries are much more behind than the US, and we are looking for the next great advance in IA," Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the odds that the next achievement in IA was made in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director General of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won American Othello player with higher score and was later executive in Microsoft Research of Google's branch in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology competitions as the robotic challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers usually have to work hard to get government bags, Lee says.
"China is not who is taking the academic leaders, but the companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university genes to work in IA.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the US to boost its efforts in IA.
"I think they should offer residency cards to doctors in IA," he said.
The Council of State of China published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of a New Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include industrial and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the selection of the artificial information committee.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
Instead of the NSF, you've now invested more than $100 million a year in research in IA.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence did not record movement for months.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and that would block requests for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbours in the north represents a claim from its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result would reach 50 per cent of the minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum's paper was: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name change advocates, among them Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO in Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have voted for the country's future, for Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they would achieve the result of the vote and that they would do so definitively.
Change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of Parliament.
The State Elections Committee stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularities were recorded.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited his vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of country name that would open the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents for whom they boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our head high and not by the service door," Kavadarkov added.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO accession will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate above 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO," Zaev commented after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the requirement.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television chain Telma indicated that 57 per cent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote yes.
In order for the reference to be valid, the result has to be 50 percent more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May of the past.
View: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire Brighton defense and ends by marking a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took account of Brighton's defence with the Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously simple to mark the goal of minute 65.
The Argentine advance received a passage in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton's defenses before he ran the open field.
Then Aguero was found surrounded by four green shirts.
A defense was set up before several more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English advance used the first token area to return the balloon to Aguero, who hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan guard with a shot at the right of the network.
"Aguero is going through some trouble on his foot," said the City trainer, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky you marked at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the front of the Premier League.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the balloon at the depth of Brighton's field at that game.
He sent a beautiful passage to the right-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite position.
The blueheads put the ball in the doorway before they left the camp.
The city will face the Hoppenheim group at the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to celebrate the party to the Rockies
With the Nationals outside the struggle for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But a always competitive Scherzer expects to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but there are only still implications in the elimination for the Rockies, which bring an advantage party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies secured at least one position of the wild with the victory 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still try to close their first division title.
"Even though we don't play anything, at least we can play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I've played this year.
Why don't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opening will be on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to get Scherzer into a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his start number 34, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual rest day.
The right of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump celebrates a myth in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the outcome in the mid-term elections.
"Let's play everything we did in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't, but I really do, and that's why I'm going to fight for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You've already come to this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what's going on now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, evil, and miscarriage.
They don't care who does harm, over who they have to pass to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we'll never give it to him."
The democratic mission is to oppose and obstruct."
"And they've seen it for the past four days," he said, qualifying the Democrats for "angrished, valved, disgusting and lying."
He named the Senate Judicial Committee, quoting Senator Diane Feinstein by name, who received strong support from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Have you filtered the document?
Mmm. Come on, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labor Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members that we are not well received, and everything to say to our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because he was faced with decision-making on anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, random issues that Jeremy discussed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a worker, the committee's Friday night meetings have been exactly the same.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it ever started.
It is increasingly evident that the laborist party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party's leader.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, when fellows with whom he was going to share a similar political vision began to expect me to stand back and adopt positions with which he would never agree, both on national security and on the EU's single market.
When I speak in public, and actually from a little bit of the same, there's a tremendous aloof and attacks on social networks censoring the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be at the Laborist Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how the levels of insult were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every movement of "untrustworthy" or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower in vision.
Over the last few years, I've received a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head down, not to be so frank, and that then "everything would be good for me."
But I didn't put myself in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there are 32 still in school, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally let my class fall, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them, both being local councillor and government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could possibly confuse my political positions and I disagree with the party's current leadership.
To those who promoted Friday's motion, the only thing I would say is that while the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand that desire to waste time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party's leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no political threat or convenience will deter me from acting as I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invited Ayr Head
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this fine party of the Tenent's Premier League.
Now they're leading the table and it's the only inviolable team in the ten.
Finally, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk-taking, that led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"So far we've been tested in our party and we're still in doubt, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You must recognize that Ayr has taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have."
The trial at the 14th minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put before Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to set up the numbers and Jason Baggot caught a wrong launch.
Climo increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalti, before, right in the middle of time, turned a single shot, leaving marker 17-5 in favour of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop due to the serious injury that Ruarid Knott suffered, who left the camp on the ground and, from the beginning, Ayr advanced further through a trial by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
The captain in the function of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose went off to have another player with a Bruce Colvine test that was not consumed, at the end of a very pressured period.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for plating the Climo when he had no balloon, McPjherson scored a test from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo marked it, as he almost made it from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in David Armstrong's area and sent it to Gregor Henry's third line to get the fifth test of the local team.
Still Game's protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the next nine seasons will be final, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "good business" restaurants.
'The sea is ours': interior Bolivia expects the court to go to the Pacific
The sailors watched a shipyard covered with appliances in La Paz.
Public buildings run a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are anchored by the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Getting it is a duty."
In Bolivia without the sea, the memory of a lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict of resources continues to be alive, just as the desire to reinvigorate the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at its highest point in decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see CIX's judgment on giant screens throughout the country with the hope that the Hague Court will speak in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia's concession from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot in play in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia a reason, and that it would not change much if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory, and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the CIX judgment comes only six months after the final arguments we have heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", says the Chilean expert on international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could have been delayed.
"The topic of access to the sea takes a long time blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate protests.
Morales' charming rhetoric undermined Chile's good will, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haia, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new phase of relations with Chile," and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits."
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, even one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong declares that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is produced at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "a utopia" that the United States' continued sanctions and objections to a declaration that put an end to the Korean War can double North.
In Washington, they refused to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is generalized skepticism that Pyongyang seriously talks about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or be fully covered in the sun, don't look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered in the gateway a series of extravagance accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that admired the public with the purest style of the Week of Paris fashion.
The impossible shadows filled Instagram this summer and these designers pulled their most amazing creations out into the gateway.
Valentine's main piece was an excessive hat beak adorned with a wide abate imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories there were shoddy sandals, a magic hat and even a pin, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their hairy lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the tall sewing.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive team, with the glasses and the tube, and another one of the frozen ice cone.
And if he's a huge fashion fan, he's lucky.
The fashionable people predicted that giant hats could reach the tents.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomba", the hat with a 60 centimeter abate that takes the whole world from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The mark of worship behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks brought out another great creation: a beach bag almost as large as the model fitted with a bathroom that carries it.
The orange riffin bag decorated with raffin flakes and finished with a white leather strap, was the highlight of the Spring Summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera in the Week of Paris fashion.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I hope that the hats and big beach bags will reach the tents next summer, as the designer had a big impact that would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories'.
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the world's citizens
The private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community matters.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS by their English-language stamps), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a plan of studies to measure, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that's enough.
But if you speak with him in his own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the table and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an outstanding education.
The data, compiled from 74 schools that make up SCIS, show that 72% of students received a mandarin grade, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an outstanding degree.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
At present, languages are being given the same consideration as materials such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in programs of private and all kinds.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014, indicated that among the lack of language knowledge, 17% of the reasons why employers need to cover their vacancies.
So linguistic skills are increasingly essential to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% didn't speak any foreign language as well as to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for kids today.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children the most opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others rely on languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of their children, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialized teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to win, whatever their future is.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
It needs to be done.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron begins with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the eveningers who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach, Like Walton, announced that James would play the initial match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to decide how many minutes you'll play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, they asked James for his plans at the time of the six Lakers parties.
At these heights of my career, I don't need pre-emptions to be ready," he said.
Trump's election events come to Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaigning half-years tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's five halfs scheduled for next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation in delay for your candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-term elections, given that the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's half-life in West Virginia and how can you see it online?
Trump's mine in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's half in West Virginia following via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the matter of the trial this week for the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense for allegations of improper sexual conduct and who has suspended the Senate's confirmation vote for one week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of myths is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
Therefore, these five mines that Trump will give next week are aimed at "dynamimizing volunteers and sympathizers while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority that they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible to the campaign season," said Reuters a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
In the middle of the night, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, it could bring together the supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep the hope alive to the individual parties of Sunday
After three individual sessions, the foursome of Saturday afternoon might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum of impulse is a completely invented sport concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They have a six-point advantage, and now they're four, so I guess we'll take that as a little impulse," said Jordan Speeth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four advantages with twelve more in play.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a bit of wind in favor and much for encouragement, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points four.
Speeth has been lethal from tea to green and is preaching with example.
Those gutural screams were made stronger as he progressed his round, making a crucial putt to push the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
On getting the putt that made them win the 15th, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he thinks the American team is not out yet.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," Spieth said.
It's the only thing left to these players right now.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four to four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way in which it seems to flow its energy to the crowd and from it, confirms them as rivals beating on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to win when the sun is set on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly exposed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the tomorrow's fourballs, when he confronted Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole that they've never been close to leaving.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the way they can change a strategy in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant advantage the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US Team has a hard fight, something that some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and the foursomes with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty climbing four points to the Le Golf National marker.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who sought to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four matches, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points from the 12 individual Sunday parties to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points followed, while Molinari and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points of the four initial parties in the history of Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they matched perfection to defeat a disarmed Woods and American novel Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who fought two parties on Saturday without punishment or glory, showed occasional lightnings of brightness, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and five follow-up.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning's furballs, came back to meet with his wife Henrik Stenson in the furrooms getting a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three of the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwestern Paris.
The three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas fixed the reference point for the Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 again in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup's history where a team goes up four points in the individual, although as the current champion, Furyk's team only needs to mount to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Red says no to unilateral disarmament if you don't trust it
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased his distrust in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea would take "significant steps to show its good will" last year, like stopping nuclear tests and missiles, disarming nuclear testing camps and commiting itself to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see the corresponding answer by the US," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first for us."
While Ri resumed the already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization due to which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, its declaration seemed important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump in the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump secured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long been looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "unnuclearization first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive success, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this topic of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead point."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "evil president" Trump called Kim "man shoot you on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take action to disarmament, but said that there is still much work to be done and that sanctions should be kept until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump said there was no time for that, and that "it's been two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council that: "The fulfilment of the Security Council's sanctions should continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut the funds for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had progressed, in just a few hours that North Korea had complained to him about making mafia requests.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "corresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the corresponding "measures" he requested were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the advance towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of masquerading culture to study all night inspired by caffeine.
One academic found that university students number one in the world often do not know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, designed the course, which he believes is the first of this kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
'At the end of the course, a girl came up and said to me, 'Why do you just tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helped with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The duration course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cupboards, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine in bedtime.
In another section, inform participants how the lack of long sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain failure, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of spending the entire night awake still exists, says, and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who needed sleep was a growing problem.
To ensure that he sleeps enough and has a good quality sleep must be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, signal it. Even avoid getting fat, since sleeplessness causes the brain to enter into induction, which makes him hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Cheisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm to sleep, as well as when they wake up. Similarly, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to take down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory at home since the 4-1th triumph in St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a trainer, who left his team at eight points of the Hearts, the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the rest and a few-inhaled alignment of the Rangers never gave the feeling that he was getting married.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth place, Livingston went up to the third place and is only behind the Hibernate with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to deal with a head wound along the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged Ayr into the semifinals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 from Livingstone who took a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized together drowned his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may dominate possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the balloon.
They could have marked in just two minutes when the short passage of the first time in Menga sent Scott Pittman to the doorway of Allan McGregor, but the central camper lost this great opportunity.
A powerful release from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him in the second suit.
The Rangers took control, but they seem to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt that they would have to have asked for a penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only made two shots at the door in the first half, but the former Ibrox's guard, Liam Kelly, had only problems with Lassana Coulibally's head finish and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in the face of the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on his rest by changing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, but he almost had an immediate effect when the storm made a pass to Morelos, but the impotent Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston kept devouring visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgov and Halkett picking up a long ball after another.
Holt's team might have extended the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow got his head off the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he met with Jacobs, but Thomson made the look fat again.
German: Geiger's inventor
And now a page of our Sunday Morning Sunday Sunday: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and told... it was the day the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as Geiger counter.
A pear of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Crownado" ("The Crowned Camps"), played by those scientists who seem to be insolvent Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactive activity of the minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure you're crashing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognise defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, altering them in the laboratory
They can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and reinject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, which are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of patients' immune cells and "sensinalas" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West boarded a speech in favour of Trump using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat on its appearance in the Saturday Night Live (SNL) program.
And the result wasn't good.
During a Saturday Night Live program, they supported Kanye West in the study after a confusing presentation in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be presented as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's a racist?"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL launched the program with a satire staged by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the United States Senate Judicial Committee on the sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, Chris Rock went up the images of West critique on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that there had been a bad time in the builders because of their hat.
"They spent time with me in the building.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They scared me!
And then they said I was going to go," Washington Examiner said.
West went on, "Do you want to see how I'm gonna get my pick?" saying that I'm going to "use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do."
Try with love."
His comments led to adjournment in the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL list seemed to be embarrassed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "All the study remained in absolute silence."
They had appointed West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, rapist Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people perplexing with an interpretation of song I love it ("I love it"), dressed as a water bottle Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for making the Mafia."
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "to be who it is and that is absolutely wonderful".
"So, I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art') who I think is embraceing and spreading an ideology that is prejudicial to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "to be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Master Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.

The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword management role as Jon Snow in the violent fantastic medieval series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of machista hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it seems that young people often have to be hard to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something has failed" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt "very strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong at this moment, what are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, of course, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any mention of the Game of Thrones when the series reaches its end next summer, claiming that "a lot of horses and battlefields".
As of November, Kit will stage a True West reposition from Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thought his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best Game of Thrones.
"I knew my wife in this program, so somehow she provided me with my future family and my life here ahead," she said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in Emmy's fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities have declared.
40,000 new cases have been notified only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been practically reduced to zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in interim terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has been extended.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that a member of staff is filtering data from senators of the Republican Party, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the US representative, Maxine Waters, denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the U.S. Republican Party on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultradereit".
"Truths, lies, and more infamous lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
According to the report, the information disseminated included the private addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of improper sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded charge is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for the filtering of this information.
This baseless charge is totally false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement soon sparked online criticism, including those of the former Press Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This wretch was made angry," wrote Flescher.
"You'll understand that you don't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't get angry.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the defendant's motives.
It must remain approachable and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to which critics accused him of feeling too angry during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to dump Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true," he said on a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the law enforcement authorities and appropriate authorities of these false accusations.
"We will make sure to discover the guilty," he continued, "so that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all and every member of my team."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the frankness of this parody and comedy of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire be converted into a matter of obviously stupidity that we are in the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, Johnny English's incompetent eyeball character and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comical creation designed for non-angl film territories.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his strafal claims of glamour cheering, has a bit of Clouseau, a uncle of Mr Bean and a piece of that kind who contributed with a single note on the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once interpreted in Barclaycard's now forgotten TV ads, in which he seeded chaos at his step.
There's a couple of good times at Johnny English's last date.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while he uses a medieval armor suit and the rotor steps make a brief shock against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to the physical comedy jumps into sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" movies, like 007 and Impossible Mission, are already using comedy as a convincing ingredient.
It seems as if the humor was directed to children instead of adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant disadvantages are not as enchanted or concentrated as Atkinson's movie jokes change when incarnate Bean's character.
Now the permanent topic argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates on the network of British supersecret web spies and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the agent who's in service, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the culmination of a prime prime minister in conflict, who already suffers a total political impoparity crisis: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your infuriate intelligence advisors that, as all the spies were committed to active, they must take someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English as a person, who now works as a professor in some snob institution, but gives extra-official classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers a spy academy to a rock school.
They're taking English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meeting with their old and suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the misdemeanours of the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the first minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the multimillionaire technological charismatic who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the late Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odise of ridiculous falcaturades: dressing of chambermaids, set fire to a french restaurant; create a riot that puts them illegally on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes total anarchy by trying to use some shells of virtual reality to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
Obviously, all the arrests are out of this last sequence, but in a kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems pulled out of a children's television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but it covers five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover for five
Suddenly, the party wants entrepreneurs to pass the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would be "adjusted" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to incline the country to the benefit of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported changes of four days a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labor Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to night, but a four-day working week is an ambition that adjusts to the party's approach to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as to the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
Thus, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition in its entirety.
A spokesperson of the Labour Party said, "A four-day working week does not enter the party's policy and is not being considered by this party."
The chancellor in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the conference of the Labour Party last week to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr.McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also involve the possibility that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their investment, as a laborist government could make "deductions" due to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers on company councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees, which are paying annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question is whether the department's findings could influence the Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, on the issue of an interview, the reporter of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy showed up more openly than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems unbearable.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know this: Brett repeatedly denied it," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star poster that will act and an equally impressive mission, to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people go to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness of the real goal of the event to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant public had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as making a volunteer, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help create awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen at the age of 12 to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with free concert is a xenuin way of convincing people to ask for measures or is it just another case of what is called "clitivism", people who think it makes a difference when signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, promoting a set of different goals.
He claims that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37,000 million established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in the United Kingdom who committed themselves to "helping children develop up to their maximum potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national authorities and supporters of Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to the page of history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions on your website, "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that happened to the great anti-apartheid movements and in favour of the civil rights that preceded us, we will achieve it, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out a "block" to make it difficult for Russian energy exports, the US Secretary of Interior announced
"If necessary," Washington may use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including that of the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where the legitimate government is operating, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with the energy in the same way they did it in Eastern Europe," he said, as reported.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the ways and the means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, together with the Navy, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of taking advantage of and replacing fuels," he commented, at the same time as referring to Russia, saying that "you only have a tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
Statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unadequate" project of Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a "cativa" from Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream oil pipeline 2 of $11 billion, which was set up to double the capacity of the existing oil pipeline at 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak, meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The US position received the German reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the German Federation of Industries (BDI, for its German stamps), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, BDI president, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency in 2020, said Senator de Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he would carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency during the mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the broken government and that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"On 6 November, I will carefully examine my candidacy to the presidency."
Warren felt about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, claiming that he was " taking this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticisms to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
However, in a poll published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren's own voters do not believe that it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said that the senator would not submit his candidacy, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The investigation showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in connection with a possible candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially before January, he informed the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin cites the post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin in the middle of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
On Monday night, they were arrested and charged with domestic violence
"With what my own son is going through, with which he's going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of the TPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers come back," explained the audience in a half of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo theme and that his son and other war veterans "are becoming different, hardened, wondering if there is any reason why the military and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered the country."
They arrested him on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused him of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time as he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District Challenges New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a judicial appeal in relation to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, 18-state representatives and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant part of Grace's Preituary Sessions v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (United States for Civil Liberties) presented in August did not reveal itself against federal policy.
He said his partner "and his children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but the US officials refused his asylum application on July 20th.
Detonated Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers for the United States, such as nations that face generalized problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy withdrew a 2014 decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals (Council of Immigration Appeals) which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires all applications for asylum to be made according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "provide labour".
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who were victims of domestic abuse and violence by criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in their policy announcement on 11 June.
The asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her baby in the city's evacuation center of Palu.
"Every minute comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined houses, collecting their stolen property, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who broke the back and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated in the open air because of persistent and strong replicas.
The tears filled her eyes as she explained how she felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor she shared with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall smashed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was in a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just shut up.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of using "propagandistic ad"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praying for the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of serving the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, referred to China Daily's payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of taking part in the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, because China denies.
Trump's accusation that Pequin was trying to get involved in the U.S. elections, marked what the officials of that country held in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war testify to the level of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, the Chinese countervailing tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm state exporters like Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of China's leading exporters of agricultural products, said Pequín had prejudiced workers, farmers and North American entrepreneurs.
In an article written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China is "intensifying this campaign of harassment by broadcasting propaganda ads in the free American press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a payment notice in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the post of newspapers located at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the dissident opinions that the Chinese may have on China's worrying economic path, since the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he claims that "one of China's most important journals has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he has not confirmed that it is a newspaper.
Kavanaugh's disaster makes women's Republican vote a few days from the mid-term elections
Although many of the major Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various allegations of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially of female voters, in the next half-term elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and the majority of the Republicans were put forward to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Maxwell University of Syracuse, in an article published on Sunday at The Hill.
Reeher also claimed that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is in doubt enough to calm the spirits of the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman for the MoveOn Progressive Group, in the Washington Journal, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, at the flu of "Acercase November!", appeared in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will surpass any expectations," he assured Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"Of course it's already high,
But it's going to be even more marked, especially among the indecisive voting women from outside neighborhoods or those between 18 and 29 years old, who, even though they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls."
Before Ford's public witness detailed his charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidates, analysts suggested that it would be possible to have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the bank of the accused or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of the Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided between believing the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support this latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the surveyed people believe in Ford's witness in total or probably in front of 35% that supports Kavanaugh's witness.
In addition, 38% believe that the most likely is that Kavanaugh lied during his witness, in front of a 30% who thinks the same thing about Ford.
With the pressure exerted by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked in a state of marriage when he was 17 years old.
On the other hand, Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a university party when he was studying in Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web Creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inruptt, the last project of this technology legend, is a solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what information people can access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was lucky to have the intention of hiding Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or POD.
Contact lists, to-dos, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access that information.
The company describes this as a "personal power through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook nor Google about entering or not a complete change that would change their business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Homnage Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Cross of Victoria during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was won on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was murdered by a sniper four days later without knowing that he was granted the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a memorial in his honor at a show in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his granddaughters, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument 100 years after his grandfather's fascination with his title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann addressed his battalion through the Saint Quentin channel "through a dense fog and under the play of an intense fire of machine guns".
Later he hurried to get to the line of fire and, with a "great courage," directed the line forward before he rushed with a cannon and no one's help, and threw three people out of the enemy's presence.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was murdered by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson like that."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genius hero shows him the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut the list to MMA's favorites at the best time
Imagine that you've been taking all night smart to enjoy the entire show of Bellator 206, and when you get to the best of it, something's stopping you.
San Jose's cartel included 13 battles, being six main ones, and was streaming live in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
But on the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see their faces, the UK spectators were perplexing when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many hours waiting to see the struggle.
An amateur described the change to these childish cartoons on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste."
"The state law ruled that this content was not appropriate for the 6th of the morning, and that was why it had to change to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Marketing and Bellator Communication vice president, when he was asked for the re-transmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they'll take into account UK viewers in future programming.
"I think we'll be able to solve it when we think about the repetition," said Coker.
"But if it's 6:00 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working on finding a solution.
When the change occurred, I began to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
I'm so angry."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to the institute.
Invited to the first release of the Desert Island Radio 4 Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, she explained that she began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is low by illness.
As a guest of Laverne's first program, Daley shared that she felt "low" to the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable that you liked children and girls."
So he said, "Even today, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what moved me and gave me the strength needed to achieve success."
I wanted to prove that it was "someone" so that people wouldn't be disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in Australia's Commonwealth games to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of the consequences, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said to fall in love with US director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was all a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and said that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live in such a short time" (with only 14 years of age and your father died of cancer three years later) it's hard to find someone of your age who has experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
To me, my medal is Robbie."
His son takes his father Robert's name, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked his son to do was get tickets to London in 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell you that I wouldn't be here to occupy that first row," Daley said.
"He was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that exact moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that he was not really invincible." he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that time I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling"
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, as it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still puts his hair on his head.

A low-grade mickelson ended up at Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he's got to improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve his movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of players, nor even at the peak of their career, at their 48 years it did not fit in the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the high grass usually punish the wrong shots.
And if this wasn't enough, Mikkelson was in front of the ninth match on Sunday at the accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, begin with a good footing, Mickelson's action could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted his husband, even though he couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a palm in my shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow would be ready," Furyk said.
"I had full confidence in myself.
It has a prominent place in the Fam Hall and has contributed a lot to the teams last week.
I probably didn't think I'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but eventually it's the way things are, and that's how we think they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
I could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palm trees.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halfs, even though Furyk says his presence also provides untenable to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with a genius and he likes to get in with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see the good that the younger players spent with him this week.
It's much more with a good player."
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears for the loss of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of individuals from Ryder Cup can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes started in 1997 in a party in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum advantage winning 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brooklyn, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won a little," Bjorn said, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for everybody.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I'm not tired of saying that, I'm focused on our 12 players that are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added, "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual events, and there we have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a companion next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then try your ability as a golfer as best you can.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to have a better individual performance than with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
The Furyk himself was in both two extremes of those rounds of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, but ending up as a loser during the European miracle in Medina."
"I remember each of the damn words," he answered when he was asked if he remembered as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered the players face-to-face the last day.
"We have 12 important parties, but you'd like to have a quick start like that of Brookline or Medina.
When you see that the impulse goes in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We prepare our alignment by taking this into account and putting the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the ranking.
"I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
The new German warship once again
The German Army's newest fracture should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not reach at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The position in service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class flanges, was adjourned until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Army commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen class fractures.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-heral missiles and anti-bullet missiles, as well as with hiding technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, should be possible to spread the newest fractures up to two years outside the source ports.
However, as Die Zeit well points out, these constant delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 was news last year, when the German Army officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that Marina returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
He knew little about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "critical defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen class fractures.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had an excessive dramatic weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the 7 000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total project price, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the amazing amount of EUR 3100 million is already reached, compared with the initial 2200 million.
The problems of the newest fractures are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy is staying without ships fit to disembark.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, since old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's fractures could join the Navy.
National Trust spys on the secret life of the bats
A new research that is being carried out in a factory in Scotland's Highlands is going to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for food.
Results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the Pypistrellos pygmaeus and Pipistrellos pipistrellos as well as the Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis performed by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and that is being done by each species.
A habitat map will then be developed to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Consultant, hopes that the results show that habitat areas are more important to bats and how they use each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of beaches and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works affecting children and loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and alumée also pose a risk, as well as mosquito traps, some chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, takes the bites very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, child inspections and, at times, even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reservation of insects from Scotland in Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats from Scotland.
David Thompson, State Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Thrave we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, historical trees and a wonderful habitat.
But there are many things we still don't know about the pieces, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to prosper."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks in the properties, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single child of maternity may kill up to 400 females and females, which could eliminate a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, slaughter them, or harass them, as well as destroy their children.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish staff member of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"It's still a lot to learn about insects and, in the case of many species, we don't know how they're going to their populations."
Ronaldo rejects the claims for rape and his lawyers are prepared to sue the German publication
Christian Ronaldo charges his rape against him as a fake, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know each other using his name.
Your lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
Portugal's and Youth's predecessor was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375 000 so she didn't say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel published on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33 years old, caught this false news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times no.
What was said today is false," he said to the camera five times the winner of the Golden Ball.
"People want to get to know themselves using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy and respectful man," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they qualify as "an unacceptable declaration of suspicion in the area of privacy" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damage due to an amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019 in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her annally, according to the documents submitted in the Clark County Court of Nevada District.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, was bent on saying that he was a 99% knight, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both maintained sexual relations with each other.
Mayorga also maintains that she went to the police and that she had photos of the wounded, but later she came to an extrajudicial agreement because she was terrified of the reprisals and worried about the public.
The 34-year-old woman said she was seeking to revoke the agreement while continuing to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with the Royal Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he incorporated the Italian giant Juve into an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers would abandon the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its position as world car manufacturer in Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK said at the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," Clark added.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of the delays on the border could cost jobs.
The plant of Burnaston, responsible for manufacturing the models Auris and Avensis of Toyota, produced around 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how the production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the subsidiary chain in the event of a failure to reach an agreement in Brexit.
The production line of Toyota is very adjusted, every 37 minutes pieces of UK and EU car suppliers arrive at the measure.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and spare parts could be generated.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace for more than a day on the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid such controls at the border."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so that we can enjoy the current success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," said Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent chains of subminister."
Toyota could not estimate how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, an employee of Burnaston for 24 years and union coordinator of Unite, said his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and critical plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be nice again.
The White House has stated that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and Rosenstein's justice sub-secretary could be delayed a week later due to the fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advocate Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump fired the attached general prosecutor, as if he didn't, which would put Mueller's independence at risk, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of disposing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he came to the White House, among reports that indicated he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a shock at the Senate's judicial committee hearing that Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of improper sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI's complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
In response to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There's not a fixed date yet, it could be this week or a further week, given all that's going on in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists have questioned this claim, since Sanders has been taking since September 10th without holding a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders claimed that the lack of an information session was not due to a deviation from the reporters' high-levelness, although he added that she would not be the one who denied that attitude.
You also suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, even though he did not quote any source that would rule out that data.
They will continue to hold briefings, said Sanders, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, that is much better than to address the questions to her.
You're witnesses of how we've been doing this over the last few weeks, and that's gonna replace a press tour where you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
However, solo press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions in front of the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the spirits in front of Brexit
The Health Secretariat addressed a letter to EU workers in the NHS in Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its wish to remain in the country through Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within six months of the United Kingdom leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to cover the cost of the status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, also intensified its preparations for a possible situation of disagreement.
I know this is a period of anxiety for everyone.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value each member's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
The fellow citizens of the European Union, and above and above, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christian Abercrombie submitted to an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the defeat of the Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State trainer, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he was disappointed when he got to the gang line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a trolley to conduct a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician told Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or scope of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of red shirt, is in her first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which amounted to 18 in total from the season.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This extra money will be used to help people without going home because of the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
Increased seal tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will charge a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will apply to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will be used to support the government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The charge, which is added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second houses and the purchases to rent, may be up to 3 %.
Feenda expects the change to reach 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new constructions carried out in London are marketed by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a house for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "paltsma cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson was asked to apply for a cut in the stock transfer tax to help new people acquire their first house.
He accused the great builders of keeping the prices of high housing by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenues on moderate-priced houses to fix the "hungry of the housing sector" that is living in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for housing-related reforms, including the control of tenants and the ban on defamation in which the tenant is innocent.
He also wants to grant the councils greater powers when building new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
It is not fair, however, that it is as simple for those people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being the owner of a dwelling is too far away, and the indignity that is supposed not to have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" was to become the Scotland selector at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwest club, which currently occupies the third square in League One, at three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that's all," Ross told the BBC's Sports Sound Program in Scotland.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when he was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in leading a club."
Among Ross' predecessors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he felt no concern about these so-consolidated figures in such a large club after rejecting previously proposed Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me will depend at this moment if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly own by a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't be a simple task to get there, but it's probably just that he thinks I've made it here if I can get the club back to the Premier."
Ross only takes three years as a trainer after a period of assistance in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within the heart's technical staff.
In that period it helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St. Mirren to be about to go down to win the Championship title next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he ever found during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself in a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn't hurt, I made a reasonable profit in life, and I enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and work pressure, but I like training.
I've always liked training and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview in Sportssound on Sunday 30 September in Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to a survey, the perfect time to take a paint is 5:30 a.m.
Summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulties, but it put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2.7 per cent during July, but consumption in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA's trading council, responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the world of football for longer than expected caused that in July a pattern similar to that of June, in which the pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although the restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the business volume of the restaurants during June was worse during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in drinks were the best results obtained with higher consumption increases than the reductions experienced by the restaurants.
Food pubs also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars controlled drinking increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, a member of the RSM company for the analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and sports events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It's no surprise that the restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a 4.8 per cent drop per annum will be particularly painful if you add the constant increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for the restoration business and time will be responsible for whether the temperature moderation experienced during August will provide the necessary breathing for the sector."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent during July, reflecting the acceleration in brand launches.
The sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker Industry of the UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with combined profits of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector's benchmark.
One of every five children has accounts of secret social networks that hide their parents.
One out of every five children (some of only 11 years old) have accounts of secret social networks that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey conducted at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" pages
This news caused an increase in the fear of published sexual content
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One out of every five children (some of only 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (in reference to the social network for the exchange of Instagram photos).
This news caused an increase in the fear of publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a soft "principal" account to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to "viola."
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's manager Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the advice of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Federation Council of Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and the world level, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit greatly from its incorporation to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm very keen to make an athlete's spokesman and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic gold and currently working as a usual commentator for the BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago I suffered an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and until I graduated.
It was a exhausting job, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I'm currently doing austerity exercises.
"Thank you for the encouragement messages."
An ad from a breast milk extractor for women with cows divided into public opinion on the networks
A breast milk extractor company divided public opinion into networks with an ad in which it compares infants with cows that are breast-feeding.
To announce the launch of the declared "first breast milk extractor silent laptop of the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new breast milk extractor.
Four royal mothers dance in a bowl full of rage for cows at the rhythm of a song with words like, "Yes, I've moved myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not open, they're my breasts."
The choir continues: "Museum, fly, I'm feeding babies, fly, fly, fly, I'm mowing my friends."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, provoked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this poses the "horrores" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give the light so they can produce milk, but in their case we stole their children days after giving the light," wrote one.
The Elvie milk extractor can be discreetly placed within a mother's subjection (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "clearly traumatic to the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to announce a milk extractor for babies who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What ad with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the ad, even one woman said the song seemed "very funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Taking out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little fired, but I understand it as a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their places of work or in bathrooms) and feel like "vaces".
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can fit in discreetly in a maternal subject, which gives women freedom to move, submit their babies and even go out there while they're taking out their milk.
Ana Balarin, mother's executive creative partner and director, commented: "Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a daring and challenging launch.
In describing the parallelism existing between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of milk and all the challenges that involve while we demonstrated in a manner of entertainment and close to the incredible feeling of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time Elvie extractor takes over the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures shot at the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively invariable, partly due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration made it difficult to assign fathers to children.
Traditionally, most of the fathers were also immigrants without papers and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential employers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had asked to recruit minors without company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who are natives or who are part of their home are found illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require any of them to appear in the trial before spending a month in custody instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the refugee workers.
Many will appear through a video conference instead of a person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements to receive assistance shall be promptly deported.
The longer they stay under custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may cause violent seizures or attempts to escape according to the refugee workers and reports of the system published in the last few months.
The lawyers said that these fears increase in centers of larger dimensions such as Tornillo, where there is more possibility that the symptoms that a child is going through badly are being overlooked because of his size.
They also added that moving children to the camp zone without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouleem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Mouleem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were found in Syrian soil illegally, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in the proper way".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he communicated to the assembly.
Moulem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "from every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and the Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he blamed "some Western countries" for "distribution of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
"We appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great rebel base of Idlib allowed for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action would target the Shihadists, including the soldiers on the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, who would "be eradicated".
The UN envoy of Mistura staff is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draw up a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem put forward the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, affirming that the work of the body should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second warrant
Following that logic, Mr Trump would be able to re-elect in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency in a premature manner.
Which would no doubt be "The most dramatic end of a presidency."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, audience indexes in prime-time have multiplied by more than two, to reach 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and almost tripled until reaching 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show program led the cable channel audience indexes with 3.5 million viewers during the nights on which important news was produced.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a drama showrunner for ABC "Designed Survivor", who is a secretary of the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys," the club has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver commented that he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why, he asked.
"He answered, 'Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that appears on TV, the plots that Washington's system can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if the immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Even so, it's supposed to be more than an informed citizen spending six hours seeing a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his "Fare" book, Paul Manafort's "a full-fledged suit", said Washington Pos, and the implications of the scrupulous descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, the senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the changes in characters and the daily arguments of Trump's show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the praise to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll stay behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he made the sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He was unable to get out while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs at that time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money comes to a lot of money to fund the nominations to the House for the elections of half of the lexislature
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in positions in the career to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburgh which was recently reorganized is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is represented against another representative in functions, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superior to the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was determined in January that the Republicans would manipulate the electoral circumscription of the former districts in their favor.
The election career in the new 17th Congressional District held a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Congress Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after reaching a victory set in the special March elections to the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
That place was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalising El Salvador for its support of China and then withdrew
Diplomatics warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama would already recognize Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr Trump held a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even held a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the Trump Organization steering team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to order returning to the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "slow recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement made this same month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against O Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was fought.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on visas, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possibility of applying sanctions to O Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is scheduled to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance given to him by the administration, the diplomats said.
The three US envoys discreetly returned to O Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson from the White House of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations always and when the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study history
The next negative case could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Mr Trump's justice, from which there are currently abundant evidence in the public file.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump's campaign has concurred with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to report to that agency, just when you have to prepare for the elections, and you may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are very unknown and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall be inevitable, as is the case with his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western front resists and supports the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We fail and miss the opportunity to avoid the years of murders that happened later.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or backward.
The U.S. is facing a number of of these inflexible points at this point.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein takes water to his neck since this paper reported that last year, he suggested writing in secret to the president and speculating that he was incapacitated to the office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information of The Times is not true.
"How are we going to respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed in spite of the alleged charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the half-legislative elections for a Congress requiring responsibility for Mr Trump?
If we do not overcome those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which I knew from the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to capture Shabat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that heritage, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans' player shows an optimistic face-to-face encounter with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive empathy achieved in Spain in front of the Villareal this month, would put them in a very favourable position to be classified in the Group of the G of Europe League.
An injury in the knee prevented Central Campist Graham Dorrans from starting this season until the 2-2 empatte in front of Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, since Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We went into the party believing that we could get something positive and we got a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but generally the empathy is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last party, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was tough amongst all that happened with my injuries and changes in the team, but there's an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and succeed."
Women worry about saving for their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear as they wanted to be looked after, few people talked to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide claimed that they commented with their peers on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want you to take care of a family, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Department.
You can start next.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don't communicate your wishes with a lot of anticipation.
Work with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to get care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Among the long-term care funding options are a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-based hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-security covered by your own funds, whenever you have money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are not able to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a notarial power to manage your finances.
You'll have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your parent has a medical emergency and goes on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Please note that this information is detailed in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who care for it?" asked Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Set up a plan."

The victim, aged 40, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he received shots in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which occurred approximately at 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Your wounds are not serious, and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Because of the cutoff of communications, the rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, a zone located north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provided you with some key data on Palu and Dongala, on the island of Célebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a regency located more than 300 km from the coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, a region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy in the province of Célebes Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia finds itself on the Pacific Fireplace of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, in front of the Sumatran coast.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees magnitude struck south of Xava, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude was caused near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude affected the Mentawai islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the regency of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
There were no tsunamis on this occasion, but more than 100 people died because of the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily shot.
Arresting the eldest son of Sarah Palin for allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old naturalist from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspected of a domestic violence crime, preventing the submission of a complaint by domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he removed the phone.
Palin remains in preventive detention in the Mat-Su Pretral Facility units with a $500 loan, according to KTUU.
He presented himself to the trial on Saturday, in which he declared "not guilty, since then" when he was asked, he informed the chain.
Palin is charged with three minor A crimes, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin are presented.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently found in the Alaska War veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing the submission of a complaint for domestic violence and of possession of arms in a Hebrew state in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of plunging a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome that he suffered after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
Counted at least 384 dead after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the balance of the dead is expected to increase with the passing of the day.
The earthquake was just ahead of Central Celebes, in the northwest of the Indonesian capital, Jacarta.
They circle videos through social networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a few times the death penalty to the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that caused the death of eight people, a penalty not applicable in the state since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike attack at the West Side Highway Avenue in Lower Manhattan, tracking the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and caused them serious "intendedly" injuries, according to the notification of the intention to apply for the death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with a charge of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, practice commonly used by the prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors declared, describing how Saipov carried out the "strange, cruel and devious" attack.
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notice of intent to accuse.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago the South District of New York didn't process a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but finally the eternal chain was sentenced in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack according to the court documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he showed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
It has been declared innocent of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "evidently disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt with a permanent chain without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all persons involved," Patton commented.
Saipov's defense team would ask the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
A parliamentary tory claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians had to " feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that they should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Regular Mr Peter Bone said in the presence of Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "already left" the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in reconciling the divided lines of her party was evidenced by joining the Tories in favour of remaining in the EU to an independent protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit, the opposition and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the concentration of the Leave Means Leave of Solihull movement that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been contacted to assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If it had been entrusted to you, we would have already been outside the EU at this time," he said.
The member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must put an end to the Chequers plan'.
Showing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the suggestions indicating that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wants to remain in the EU is completely false".
The member of the bullies and party of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also came to the march, since he showed the reporters: "The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is impotent between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are those who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians feel uncomfortable if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Today this is a topic of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're meeting today to tell them that we're not gonna let them out with theirs."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the EU's remaining partners took a march through Birmingham before celebrating a concentration of two hours in the city centre.
A number of activists ran out of cards with the message Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit) after the group's launch this weekend.
The laborer Lord Adonis joked about the conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a free border, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
Brexit's concept doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or present himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously think his candidacy to the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday during a municipal session in a village in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will present the reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It focuses on speculations that place it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his electors using the format of the council since Trump took over the presidency.
An assistant asked if he was planning to introduce himself to the president.
Warren replied that it is the time that "we women go to Washington to solve the problems of our government, and that is why a woman in the presidency is missing."
An arrest related to Sims's deadly shooting, the LSU player
Baton Rouge police, the English, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 (east time).
They posted a shooting video on Friday asking for help to identify a man who was going out in the pictures.

Great prize from Russia: Lewis Hamilton reached the world title thanks to the team orders, which enabled him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It has been clear since the time that Valtteri Bottas graduated from Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would be decisive in the career.
Bottas, who was leaving the pole, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxes first and let Hamilton run traffic in the back of the group, something that would prove decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxes one time later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton followed him after several round maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to leave himself unattended the risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and rose to the seventh square at the end of the first time on the day of his 21st anniversary.
Then he led the career during a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tires to get to the final part faster and to advance Kimi Raikkonen by fourth position.
Finally he entered boxing around 44 but could not move any position in the last eight rounds, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and he was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
A poorly qualified body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistence on claiming that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was charged with sexual abuse.
In a speech in an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the witness given by Ford in front of the Senate Judicial Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "miserable, repugnant and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that is happening in the Senate in the last days, when you see indignation, when you see that people who are angry and who are miserable, repugnant and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filterings and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't go."
Are you cleaning up?
Diane Feinstein, did you do any filtering?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No.", he added imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein said to the committee as reported by The Hill.
"I asked you to keep your privacy and do what you asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented on the following during the act of Saturday night: "I told you that the body language was not the right one.
He may not be filtered, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was charged with improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to recover power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trap to regain power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday at Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early advantage through two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got into the local set before Dwyer re-established the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard got into Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who managed to get back up to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal was produced at 3:35 p.m. through Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvilleer after David Rutherford's assistance.
In a period of agitation, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to mark the goal of the match at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants moved in the marker before the first break when he scored his second goal at night at the end of the first period.

An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers from an aircraft can escape a earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely be fired.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many disappeared after a great earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people trapped under the castles of the city of Palu.
Although his workmates fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, which was violently balanced.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the exit track at that time, could safely be fired.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirat said that it is possible that this decision would allow hundreds of lives to be saved, reported to Australia's ABC News channel.
We've prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Let's break our hearts when we're having fun," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death penalty may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has said that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victim's balance is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the helmets and many of them could not be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, said.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting help and live.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are pulling out the minimums."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" told CNN.
Indonesia had previously suffered earthquakes in Lombok this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing one after a plane accident in a lake
The aircraft that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lake in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing person after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew left without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The plane reported that it was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash of the plane against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The plane reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continue to be unclear.
Both the plane and the United States Army confirmed that the plane landed on the lake before reaching the landing track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has crossed the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented he came in very little time.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and the other passengers managed to move between the water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were shouting and frightened, and that he suffered a slight wound in his head.
The U.S. Army reported that some sailors who were working close to the site in the tasks of improving a pier also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sinks about 30 meters.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in aircraft accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst makes up the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution was sent to the trial on Saturday at the reprieve of a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the United States Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When these data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went down the road on Saturday and testified that that day was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was " lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"Borruna of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge showed that he was expecting the trial to be judged by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A three-thirds hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception that you have the genre filling your music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that the hip hop has distanced itself from its sources with political messages and combating social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip hop back to be popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a resurgence in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A New York Children's Caregiver asks a couple after a "racist" message.
A New Yorker child caretaker will demand a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that would not be addressed to her from her mother who complained she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anguish when she discovered that the guardian of Giselle Maurice's children was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Faxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the caregiver who had just gone, who was African-American, had done his job badly and waited for a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid her the day of work and sent her home to a Uber.
Now Maurice will demand the couple to get compensation for the dismissal and requires a compensation of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no contract on average.
"Look, I want to show you that these things are not done," he told Post on Friday, to add "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple replied to the charges of racism, claiming that saying goodbye to Maurice was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after she was offended.
"My wife would send you a message that I didn't intend to send you.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco said to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they offended, even though it was due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Will they go for someone like that?
That's not very ethical," the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and the logic applied.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not be identified with a speaking bear as they could end up in a new card
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after accepting the book, commented the following about the letter: "It's hard to put on the skin of a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know now what we know about the huge success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who worked as a camera for BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "suffering" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing imagined," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud even though you didn't really do it.
I think he felt the success of Paddington a little like that.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to his own Paddington."
My daughter was dying and had to fire me over the phone
After the landing, his daughter was rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was very bad, that it was not expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave him so that his heart would continue to slow down were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
She died a while ago and now she's being shut down.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation around families and people.
He had to stand up to me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, at that time of battle for her daughter's loss, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noting the calvary that was suffering.
"No one has detected it," he said.
"I had my head down and I fell apart all the time.
It turns out hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity by Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Posts of afflicted women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are taking cards to a galley bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers to whom you can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile was in any room."
However, he left the job before he died and was "a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis commented: "I am constantly concerned that a side effect is produced."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people who can come and talk to, even if he's a friend.
You don't stay silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her mate for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't comment on me being sad or depressed or anything like that," he commented.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
On Christmas day it struck the bottom (when the children opened their gazebos, it made no visual contact with them or anything)."
He claimed his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He broke the family.
They've challenged us.
But we have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future lies in a thread while the FBI launches research
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking (a research for a limited time and limited range), we might get a bit of unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "exposed" due to the paralysis of the parties.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its repetitiveness is due to a matter of time.
Five weeks are missing for half-legislative elections (November 6th). If, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently employ 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the bill and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea low under Kim's mandate
North Korea's number of deserters to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korea reader.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean unification ministry, said 1,127 deserts will occur during the last year, away from 2,706 of 2011.
Mr Park said that the tightening of the border controls between North Korea and China and the increase of the tariffs charged by people on the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters finally offer South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them went through China, which has the largest border crossing with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreans.
China considers the deserters to be illegal migrants instead of refugees and often compulsorily repatriates them.
The relationship between the north and the south (which technically continues in war) has improved significantly over the last few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, held in Singapore, where they agreed on a great way of working to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress ever since.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says it's not suitable to access the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and made sure that he was not fit by his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted that way, she would call her hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of sexual abuse on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was shown to be very excited, at times almost shouting and staying talking while describing his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the Committee, catalysing the accusations against him as a "kill of grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry with the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi stated he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because it demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I believe that he dequalifies himself with those statements and with the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you're currently in," Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of protection to the patient and the care of accessible health or the Roe case against Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the light of the confirmation, Kavanaugh has raised questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be nullified.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to come to the court and still hope that we say, look what's right!" said Pelosi.
And women need to do it.
It's a justified diatar, months and years of rage floating, and you can't throw it out without crying.
"When we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
He continued, "I received a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a technique that consisted of that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, I kept going.
I think it's brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an escape valve for the anger in part because essentially they are not understood.
One of my most neat memories in one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible anger to describe, was that a larger woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a taller one who always provoked me a little scared, and led me to the bottom of the stairs.
"You never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an adventure outside of marriage in a boat called Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," I said among the laughs 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone named it "Brancaneves and the Seven Years."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so he swore he wouldn't go into the run for the presidency unless he could get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to the male candidates, only $250.
"What do you think, that I have discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (by gratitude to the people who supported it, by frustration with the system that made it difficult to collect money and to address voters instead of delegates and by angry with the existing sexism) who remained speechless.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted to the press with her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what were they going to write on my stone?
"Shoot?"
How trade war between the United States and China can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China have been overwhelming, and even though the war is far from over, a distance between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale this week was produced by the application of new tariffs that affect an equivalent of $200,000 million, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Pequin's hired in the same way every time, the most recent one, raising the rates from five to ten percent in $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate US measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington to step back, it would be necessary to surrender to his demands, but publicly pledge to the United States would be much more shameful to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to start an economic crisis in the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research center in Asia's Center for New American Security, a research center.
Syria is "listed" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is requesting help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods are in place.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe wins at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat in European territory and it has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle he offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water at the 16th par. 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all its series, becoming one of the only four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the player with the worst classification of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The first world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2+1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, which is possible to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight rival Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio García became a European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry often, but today I can't help it.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American flagship of the Tiger Woods Golf for 2&1 on Sunday's individual match.
"It's amazing how proud I am today to be able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up playing that boy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, 14 major winners, just behind Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team had problems all weekend so they wouldn't leave the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-calibre golf during the whole tournament.
The captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning, Europeans were in trouble for a while.
We fight.
I take off my hat before Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
Your 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to take out the hat.
They were superior."
