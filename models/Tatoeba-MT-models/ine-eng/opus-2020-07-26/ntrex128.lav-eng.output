The members of the Wales Assembly (Assembly Members — AM) are concerned about the possibility of being "accompanied as an army"
The members of the assembly were concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of the Wales Parliament).
Its purpose is to change the name of the assembly to Welsh Parliament (Velsa Parliament).
AM throughout the political spectrum is concerned that it can make them an object of ridicule.
One of the Leiborist party AM explained that their group is concerned with "plays with the words Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: in Welsh "twp" means "unique", but "pwp" means "cake".
The Plaid AM indicated that none of the groups were "not satisfied" and recommended alternatives.
The representative of the Wales Conservative Party acknowledged that their group was ready to examine the name change, but added that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", meaning "air".
In this context, it should be noted that the English word "w" is similar to the English word "u".
The Committee of Assembly, which is currently preparing for the amendment of the name of the bill, informed: "The final decision on the terms to be used for the designation of members of the assembly is, of course, to be adopted by the members of the assembly itself."
In 2017, the Wales Government Act granted the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposals and received broad support for the change of the name of the assembly to the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name AM, the Commission gave preference to the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but MWP received the highest support in the public consultation.
AM clearly recommends alternative options, but the struggle for an agreement can bring headache to Elin Jones (Elin Jones), who is expected to submit a bill on change in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the assembly, including the laws on the structure of the system of disqualification of AM and of committees.
The final vote on how they will be called will be taken when the legislative acts have been discussed.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the country
The vote will take place on Sunday in the vote on whether their country name will be changed to the 'North Macedonian Republic'.
The national vote was organised to resolve prolonged disputes with Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, for decades.
Athens has long argued that the name of the North Neighbor has given rise to claims on its territory and has already repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request to be accepted by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, one of the plebiscite for the name changers, announced that ignoring the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), object that the change of name is simply a matter to be done to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's prayers are heard by the churches of Harlem fighting for existence.
"As the old people with whom I have discussed say, they used to be on every corner of the bar and goddess," says Mr. Adamsa.
"Now there's neither one nor the other."
He recognizes that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"Just no longer the living rooms that people visit on a regular basis."
Speaking even to the gods, he is concerned that the money he receives by selling the property will end faster than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will return at the beginning".
Goddess, he added, may be replaced by multi-dwelling buildings with apartments in which people who will not help the rest of the shrines around them will live.
"Most people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and therefore the day will come when these gods will turn to forever, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who gather in these apartments will become members of these congregations."
Both deities were raised by the white congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis, in 1870 by the Metropolitan Community, and 10 years later by St. Martin.
The original white Methodist congregation was abandoned in the 20th century.
The building took on a black congregation that had served God alongside him.
The Black Congregation of St. Martin’s goddesses took over his blessings during John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of workers in Harlem, 125th Street, in the main shopping street, who had refused to work in black or to give them a promotion.
In 1939, the fires seriously damaged the building, but since the members of the Johnson congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call.
His blessing is David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to the St. Martin's congregation, who proudly called the call game "for poor people's calls".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "Cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng (Tiffany Ng) from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by the black musician Dionysius A. Linds (Dionysius A. Lind), who moved 18 years ago to the larger call game in the Church of Riversidas.
Mr. Merivezer (Merriweather) said that the St. Martin's congregation did not stop him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s goddess were a reflection of the relationship between contemporary architects and builders, some of whom were engaged in work by the secular authorities, and others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the Council of the Congregation, consisting of the temporary leaders, addressed the diocese in writing with concerns that the diocese "will try to transfer costs" to the Council, although the Council has not been involved in the establishment of the desiccities sent to architects and builders.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the deacon’s activities.
The shark injured a 13-year-old teenager in the omar fishing area
The shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California and injured him. It was the first day of the lobster season, a storyteller.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near the Beacon's Beach in the city of Encinita.
Chad Hammel (Chad Hammel) informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends had been in the morning for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was calling for help, and then the group came to him to help him pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought that it was simply a feeling about the nailed omer, but then he "understands that the boy screams" I said!
I'm sick of it!"
All of his key bones were unlocked," Hammels, who immediately noticed it when he got to the boy.
"I stand up to leave the water: "There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by air to Reidia (Rady) Children’s Hospital in Sandjego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species infested by sharks is unknown.
The captain of the rescue guard, Larry Giles, reported that a shark had been observed a few weeks earlier in that area, but it was recognized that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jails added that the victim was traumatized by the upper part of the rubber.
Officials closed their access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca (Casablad) to Swami (Swami's) Ensinitas (Encinitas) for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Jails pointed out that more than 135 shark species are present in this area, but most are not considered as dangerous humans.
Sainsbury's plans to impress the UK industry's beauty market
"Sainsbury's" goes in attacks "Boots", "Superrug" and "Debenhams" with universal-style beauty products for hair rows and trained sellers.
As part of the considerable contribution of the United Kingdom to the large beauty market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, although the trend of fashion goods and household items is decreasing, 11 shops will be tested in the country, and, if all the tracks are successful, such a store will be more in the coming year.
In the beauty sector, funds are invested when the supermarket is looking for opportunities to use hair that were previously given to televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
"Sainsbury's" reported that it would double its offers in the field of beauty processing up to 3,000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more places with brand zones similar to those in the shops "Boots".
The supermarket also re-markets its "Boutique" decorative cosmetic line, where most products will be friendly to vegans, which are increasingly required by younger customers in the years.
In addition, the fragrance dealer Fragrance Shop will try a concession in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Kroidon (Croydon) in southern London, but the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to small food purchases every day in local stores means that wholesalers need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
"Sainsbury's" Executive Director Mike Coupe said that the trade places of the goods will become more and more like universal stores, because the shop chain is trying to fight with the discount shops "Aldi" and "Lidl", offering a larger range of services, but without food.
"Sainsbury's" has placed the Argos trading venues in several hundred shops and has opened several "Habitats" since buying both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved the sales of the goods and made it more profitable.
The previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended with a fall.
The "Sainsbury's" joint venture with the "Boots" was tried in the early 2000s, but the Union went off after a dispute to share income from pharmacies stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after "Sainsbury's" 3 years ago sold its 281 large pharmaceutical business to the owner of the "Celesio", "Lloyds Pharmacy" chain, for 125 million.
According to this plan the task of Lloyds will be to supplement the range with a wide range of exclusive skin treatment products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hiks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the thinking environment for customers, we have transformed the appearance of our beauty product hair rows and what impact it creates.
We have also invested in specifically trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but the attractive environment along with a comfortable location means that we are now a dazzling goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges the current purchasing habits."
Peter Jones "full of business" after Hollija Willovia refuses 11 million bills transaction
The Dragon Den star Peter Jones took over the nickname after Holly Willoughby, the TV broadcast leader Holly Willoughby, turned down 11 million bills of business with his lifestyle brand to pay all attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilubia doesn't have time to dedicate their home clothes and accessories to the Truly brand.
The two business was compared to the Guinean Paltrow (Gwyneth Paltrow) brand Goop.
"This Morning" 37 years old was used by Instagram as a broadcaster to announce that she was leaving.
Hollija Viloubia has abandoned the Dragon Den star Peter Jones's anger because the last moment he left his profitable lifestyle brand business – to pay attention to his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources of information claim that Jones was "full of business", when the TV girl of gold ran out at her business empire on Tuesday at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that she no longer had time to dedicate her home clothes and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of Guinea Platrov, and according to the house, it twice increases the wealth of Vilnius, which is estimated to reach 11 million mark.
When Willovia (37) used Instagram to report leaving Truly, Jones moved away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
As the source of information says: "Truly" was the main priority of the Holly.
It was to become her long - term future that would be devoted to the next decades.
Her decision to resign surprised all the non-prepared participants.
No one was able to believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the centre of Marlov, there is a warehouse for the sale of ready goods."
Experts believe that this Morning leader, who is one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay millions away from the company, as a lot of money has been invested in various products — from lightnings and candles, to clothing and household goods, and it will be even more delayed to place them on the market.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Three children’s mother, Willoubia, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
"Truly" was created with Kep in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Both of them spent their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in the Boldvina TV company.
Willubia has to become a brand M&S post, and she will replace Entu Makpartlin (Ant McPartlin) as ITV leader "I'm A Celebrity".
"We don't want to comment on his business" said Jones near the source yesterday.
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was concerned about the criticism received from the news companies about a comment that some might consider to be 'indecent to the President' and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why does the President have so much to give up?
Tramps said in his image in the voice of the dictator of knowledge.
"I didn't say anything!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Trump recognized their initial meeting in Singapore as a big step against North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats Ri Yongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the US 'responsibility' towards the initial steps towards the disarmament process.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Tramps was much more optimistic in his speech at home.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have these great relationships."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had led to a positive outcome — the cessation of the missile testing tests, the release of the winners, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about the relationship with Kim.
"And simply create the president's impression, but instead of standing out there with 10,000 people who are trying to enter this narrowly populated area, we have 200, here, here," Trump said, pointing to the effort directly ahead of him.
Cunami and earthquakes in Indonesia have left the island killing hundreds of people
Following the Lomboca earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboka were displaced, the state of the national disaster was not announced, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international help, so it is a known problem," Sombunga (Sombung) said.
Although "Save children" collects groups to travel to Paul, it is still unclear whether foreign workers can work there.
The representative of the National Disasters Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that the Indonesian officials appreciated the position of Paul in order to see if the international agencies could make their contribution.
Given that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely prone to natural disasters.
Although Aceh (Aceh) has been established in cases of paranormal tsunamis, these occur rarely along other coasts.
Most likely, people were also affected by the fact that Paul did not heed the warning sirens of the tsunami, although the warning was valid.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship hospital, which had settled in Lombo to treat earthquake victims, is now going to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the new postage victims.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) had made the improvement of Indonesia's lost infrastructure a central point of his election campaign, and he has allocated large amounts to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has been paid by Mr. Joco's administration, and he is awaiting a re-election next year.
In addition, Mr. Joko has to face the prolonged problem of tension between sections of Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were killed from their homes, while the Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using cats, bows, and bullies, and other primitive weapons.
See: player "Liverpool" Daniels Starridge with a screen restores balance in the match against "Chelsea"
Daniel Starridge (Daniel Sturridge) saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the premier way, winning the doors in the 89-minute Saturday game at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
The striker received a call from Gerdan Shakiri (Xherdan Shaqiri), about 25 metres (30 yards) from the Chelsea gates when his team was lost by 1:0.
He moved the bomb a little to the left of himself and then he pushed the bomb toward the next gate stop.
In this attempt, the bomb flew high across the field, reaching the top of the net.
Finally, the bomb flew over the head of Kep Arrizabalaga (Kep Arrizabalaga) and entered the network.
"I just tried to get their position to get to the bomb, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible," Starridge explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante (Kantte) approaching, squeezing the ball, and, without much thought, I was struggling."
In the middle of Chelsea was led by 1:0 after the words were received in 25 minutes by the Belgian star Edén Azards (Eden Hazard).
The Blues fan played the ball back to Mateo Kovacic (Mateo Kovacic), before turning to the middle of the field and placing the Liverpool field as fast as possible.
Kovačić quickly played and received the bomb back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful stone between the players, allowing Azardam to enter the area.
Azard's speed of survival protected and completed the combination, with the left leg running a stone in the further stave network, along the "Liverpool" of Elison Becker (Alisson Becker).
At 3 p.m. "Stadio San Paolo" in Naples, Italy, the Champion League will fight "Napoli".
Chelsea with Videoton will meet at 3 p.m. on Thursday at UEFA European League.
In Indonesia, the number of victims is 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunami victims in Indonesia has reached 832 people, a national disaster agency reported early Sunday.
It was reported that many people have been isolated in the caves of buildings after 7.5 large magnitude earthquake, which caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) high waves on Friday, the representative of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purvo Nugroho) informed the news conference.
In the city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, the ruins of the ruined buildings were covered.
Police suspect that a woman is arrested by a 32-year-old man
The investigation was initiated after the woman’s body was found in Birkenhead (Birkenhead), Merseyside.
The 44 - year - old victim was found at 7.55 p.m. in Grayson Mews on John (John) Street, and a 32 - year - old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have called for people in this neighborhood who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brians O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite us to contact everyone who was on John's street at Birkenhed and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also invite every taxi driver who may have fixed something in his car's video recorder material to contact us, as they may have information important to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was Birkenheda's local resident, and she was found in her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to a crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation will continue, and as the police informed, they are working on informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayonmüz, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He was not able to speak a word when he learned what had happened.
People are told that it takes hours to get them back.
It was heard that a policeman told a man that the whole neighborhood was considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up in tears instead of a crime scene.
She keeps saying, "It's so horrible!".
Two afternoons inside the cordon there were two police vans, and another one was placed right next to the outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the multi-dwelling house.
All who have information until 30 September are requested to use DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 by name 247.
Cromwell's statue in parliament becomes the latest "historic rewriting" scandal
Their refusal would be ethically justified in view of the activities similar to those of the Taliban, which resulted in the killing of so many of its fanatic Puritan followers of England’s cultural and religious monuments.
However, the Kromvela Society described Mr. Crick's proposals as "multitude" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of Kromwell's Society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate on the abolition of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Kromwell's figure would also become an objective outside the castle of Westminster.
Cromwell himself neither ordered the execution nor carried out the massacre during the wars of the English citizens.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of his past actions in the past century.
The wonderful image of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft shows the view of the 19th century and is part of the story of a person who, as many believe, is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith informed Sunday Telegraph: "Many of the Kremwells — perhaps by the end of the 19th century it was more than today — were considered to be parliamentary defenders against external pressure, which, of course, was monarchy in his case.
Historical discussions will continue on whether this is really a completely accurate picture of the theme.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognized personality that represents one of the parties to the long-standing distinction.
She has achieved, being a Lord's protector, is worth praising and mentioning."
Pig-sweet before death split farmers in China
According to information, the domestic media in the pig market attacked and killed the farmer in southwestern China.
The man — mentioned only by his name Juan (Yuan) — was found dead with a sudden artery, all in the same blood at the pig market in Liupanshui in Guidjo (Guizhou) province, reported "South China Morning Post".
Pigs are prepared to inject vaccines into pigs in the Chinese province of Cinhai (Qinghai) on 30 May 2005.
It is reported that he and his cousin had returned from the neighboring province of Junjana on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found a man dead and found that the door of the nearby pigs was open.
He told me that there was a big pig's father in the belly with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, the court's medical investigation confirmed that the burden of 550 pounds (~249 kg) had left the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and twisted," said the brother, "only his name is mentioned Vu (Wu), says "Guyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how John enters the market at 4:40 p.m. about Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed John did not belong to him or his brother.
The market manager informed "Evenning News", that the shop was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence on the scene.
According to the information, the Black family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other swine attacks are known to occur in humans.
In 2016, pigs attacked women and men at their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man being severely injured.
Just 10 years ago, 650 pounds (~295 kg) of heavy pigs in Wells had farmers stuck to the tractor until the animals killed his wife.
After the farmers in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba "CBC News" explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can act as a "gun gun".
"These are just playful.
They like to intrude, they're very knowledgeable... they don't want to hurt you.
You simply have to show them enough respect," he said.
Orkana Rosa's conclusion brings a wide and powerful case to the south-west of the United States
As predicted, Orkan Rosa, moving across the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico, will weaken.
However, during the next few days, Roza will bring rainwater-producing gases to the north of Mexico and to the south-west of the United States.
Five afternoons (after the North American Time) the pink windmills reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to the hurricane category 1, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) south of Punta Eigenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, there is a low pressure inlet moving east towards the eastern coast of the United States. For pink with tropical wind power approaching the lower California (Baja California) peninsula, it will begin the winter mass deep from the tropic strip to the north towards the south-east of the United States.
Rose will bring up to 10 inches (~25,4 cm) rain in the part of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the nearby low pressure inlet, will establish a wide, powerful rainforest in the south-west.
1 to 4 inches (~2,6 to 10,2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, double currents, and possibly land mines in the desert.
The dampness from the tropical band will result in rain gases reaching between 2 and 3 inches (~5,1 and 7,6 cm) in an hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west part, in particular most Arizona, there are expected to be up to 24 hills (~5,2–10,1 cm) rain.
Sudden floods with rapid deterioration due to the spread of tropical rains are possible.
It is very rare to go into the desert due to tropical rainstorms.
Strong rains can turn the canyons into quick rivers, but they will soon bring local brute winds and sand storms.
The low pressure plug will bring local strong lines of South California.
There are possible rain gases that together exceed half the neck (~1,3 cm), and this can cause small double flows and slide paths.
It will be the region's first rainy season.
Certain distributed tropical rain gases for Arizona will begin to reach late Sundays and early Mondays, before the rains take over a wider area late Mondays and early Tuesdays.
Heavy rains will spread on Tuesday in the Four Streets region (DR Colorado, DA Júta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and throughout Wednesday.
In October there are potential for intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as Arctic temperatures are declining, but the tropicals are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in the temperature at a short distance.
This is an example of the dramatic differences in temperature on Sunday in central USA.
The difference between the temperature in the city of Kansas, Egypt, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senluis and Demon (Des Moines), Aiov, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, it will try to form and expand a long summer heat.
It is expected that most of the U.S. central and eastern parts of October will be warm, reaching 80 and more degrees (by Farrenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsius) in large areas from south to north-east.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday (by Farrenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsius), which would exceed the average of about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts show that the first half of October, in the eastern part of the United States, will exceed the average.
Over 20 million people were listening to Breta Caveno
More than 20 million people in the six television channels on Thursday were thrilled to see the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaisey Ford, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, as reported by a woman in the 1980 ’ s.
In the meantime, political unsolved, the broadcasters stopped regular broadcasting to report on the latest developments on Friday: the agreement organised by Senator Jeff Fleik (Jeff Flake) of Arizona that the FIB will investigate charges for weeks.
Forda informed the Senate Judicial Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had robbed them of their drinking and tried to take off their clothes during high school ballet.
The coffee unscrupulously showed that he was absolutely convinced that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, on Friday, it was all seen by 20.4 million people.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the interests of the average viewers.
Data on other radio organisations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually comes up with problems, including people who are looking at the offices.
To get a better view, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of exclusive games or Oscar ceremony observers.
"Fox News Channel", whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of Kaveno, was the largest number of viewers, on average 5.69 million during the entire day's long hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS committed 3.1 million, NBC -- 2.94 million, MSNBC -- 2.89 million, and CNN -- 2.52 million, reported Nielsen.
The interest remained strong after the hearing.
Fleik was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate republican team had issued a statement that he was voting on the appointment of the Caveno, the senators observed the CNN and CBS camera Friday morning, when he, accompanied by the protestors' sarcasm, tried to reach the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
On-line CNN he stood for several minutes with his eyes pierced, like eaten.
"I'm standing right here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told that "you own power while so many women are powerless."
Fleks explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he informed him that he had something else to say at the hearing of the committee.
Cable networks and broadcasters were reflected on the Internet several hours later when the Judicial Committee was preparing to vote on the opening of Kaveno for the Senate vote.
Fleiks, however, claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FIB would look at the complaints brought by the candidates, which were asked by a minority of Democrats next week.
The Fleuk was partially convinced of the negotiations with Chris Coons, the senator of his friend's Democratic Senator.
After the meeting with Kounas and several other senators, Fleiks made his decision.
Fleika's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to approve the Caveno without an investigation.
President Tramps has commissioned the FIB to investigate the allegations raised against Kaveno (Kavanaugh).
British Prime Minister Meja accuses critics of political games because of Brexit
Prime Minister Tereza Meja, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused people who criticised her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Tereza Meja attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to an interview with their newspaper on the first page, Mija's former Foreign Minister Boris Jones continues to attack her Brexit's plan on the future relationship with the European Union, the so-called Chequers plan, stressing that the proposal for the use of one other tariff for Britain and the EU is "full of absurdity".
Type of Sims Shooting: Police have arrested Ditheon Simpson, who is suspected of the LSU player's murder
The police arrested the suspect of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Diteoon Simpson was arrested and arrested as accused of second-grade murder, Baton Rouge reported.
The officials posted a video showing a video showing Sims' clash with Simpson, and the police mentioned that Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The CBS daughter company WAFB reports that the police found glasses in the scene of crime and found Simpson's blood on them.
After understanding Simpson, the police informed him that he had confessed to the murder of the Way.
As the lawyer reports, he was given $350 000 in security.
The East Baton Rouge Parish, a team of medical experts from the East Baton Rouge Parish, will issue a preliminary conclusion on Friday, stating that death was the cause of a bullet in the head that hits the neck.
The Department thanked the Operational Group for seeking out police refugees from the state of Louisiana, the State Police Laboratory, the South University Police and the people of the territory for their assistance in the investigation, which resulted in detention.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva (Joe Alleva) thanked the territorial lawmakers for their "religion and work in the name of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (~1,98 m) long climber grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season, he won on average 5.6 points and 2.6 dropped bombs.
On Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team is "striking" and "shocked" about the type of death.

Volcano Slaps Astrays Through Mexico
The forests that rise from Pocatepetla volcano have reached the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
After the vessel’s activity was observed and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded during 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans not to come near the volcano on Saturday.
The Centre observed multiple sweating and sweating.
The images on the social networks showed that the car windmill in Mexico, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), is ready with a plan ash layer.
Geophysics have observed 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the activation of the existing volcano in the capital, since 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence-supported protestors clashed with the public order police and when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising separation vote in Catalonia.
The group’s masked separation supporters, who were delayed by the public order police, fed them with eggs and dyed the powder-shaped color by forming dark dust clouds in the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Disagreements were then made later, and the police were using sticks to prevent the fights.
For several hours, groups of independence supporters were involved in the confrontation with united supporters, who sang: "For long life for Spain!"
As reported in the local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical assistance due to minor injuries during protests.
The year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which was ratified by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains a great deal of tension.
The voters expressed their independence, although the electorate's activities were low, and those against separation were mostly boycotted.
According to the Catalonian official, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop voting at the polling stations throughout the region, and there were violent clashes.
Independent support groups had been raided on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose another way.
Narciss Teremez (Narcis Termes), a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expected Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties supporting Catalonia's independence won the last year's regional elections with a small but significant surplus, these parties have struggled to maintain the movement this year, as many of the most well-known leaders have either emigrated, or have also been arrested, and are awaiting a trial for their role in organising their referendum and its subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Hoans Puig (Joan Puig), who filmed on the phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by both sides' politicians.
"The judgment is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Uriah Zinkerez (Oriol Junqueras), who had been in detention for the previous year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament's election next year.
"Registration of European will is the best way of reversing the democratic values and repression that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderija: men arrested after car crash in the building
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39) were arrested after the car was repeatedly hit by a building in London.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent (Ballynagard Crescent) about 19.30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings informed Bob Blemming that the gates were damaged and the building itself.
At the same time, the machine may have been fired from orlet.
Menga's strike allows "Livingston" with 1-0 to win "Rangers"
Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) was the first doorkeeper to win "Livingston"
The supported "Livingston" interrupted "Rangers" by winning Steven Gerard in his second loss in 18 games, which was played in the role of Ibrox club manager.
The Dollija Mengas strike turned out to be the decisive one, as the Gerija Holt (Gary Holt) team matched the situation with "Hibernian".
The Gerard team did not win this championship season, and the next weekend they have to meet with the Leader "Hearts", from which they are left behind by eight points.
Before that, the European League's "Rangers" took Vienna's "Rapid" on Thursday.
Meanwhile, "Livingston" extended its series without loss to six games, and the main coach Holts has not yet felt the taste of defeat since last month replaced Kenya Miller (Kenny Miller).
Livingston not using the possibility against blue guests
Holta team with its direct game, which in various ways made it difficult to "Rangers", had to be in control long before they got their names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but pulled his attempt at the gate, then Alan Litgov (Alan Litgow) tried to get in the feet to delay Craig Halkett's head-up.
The owners allowed the "Rangers" to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop the guests in the planned locations.
And that is exactly how the decisive gates came to be.
"Rangers" allowed freedom, and "Livingston" used the corridor, Declan Galagher (Declan Gallagher) and Robinson joined to provide an opportunity for Menga to cross and gain gates from the middle of the area.
At this stage, "Rangers" managed the bomb, but the protection of the guests turned out to be impenetrable and the guard Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly).
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) had Kelly rescue the gates.
Scott Pittman's attempt to stop the activities of the Rangers Guard Alan Makgregor, and Lithuania borrowed the long gates in Livingston combination.
The Livingston area continued to show the centred bombs, but two calls for punishment — after Halket's fight for a bomb with Glenn Middleton (Glenn Middleton) and for hand-playing — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" performance "Livingston" — analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdairs Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
Each of them was fine, continuing to keep their hope alive, constantly improving their performance.
Their game style and personality have practically not changed since the return to the highest echelon, but a great praise has earned Holt for how he sent the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkets (Halkett) was a great man, maintaining pre-organized protection, while Menga was making sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall always remained discreet.
However, the "Rangers" lack of inspiration.
No matter how well they were sometimes under Jared, they were far from these standards.
Their last bomb was temporary — only once they entered the farm area — and this is essentially an invitation to retreat "Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is waiting for shared feelings in Chelne
On Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met in breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of laughter and blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO members.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to the King to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police, as a reason for security, blocked 25 000 people's efforts to keep them from meeting in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of whom were Kurds — also made known their attitude by condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to take them to themselves.
The mutual protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions created by the guest, whose part of the German Turk is considered a hero, but others are nothing like an autocrew.
Road accident in Deptford: the biker dies in a car crash
A bicycle driver was killed by a car in London.
Sadursme took place on the Bestwood Street crossing with Evelyn Street, on the road with intensive traffic in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, approximately 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the doctor provided help, but the man died at the scene.
SADURSME took place several months after another cyclist in the Çailders Street, about a mile from the site of the crash on Sunday.
The Police Department of the capital announced that the police were involved in identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Roads and buses are closed at the site, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during disorder
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff were injured in an irregular manner in the strict prison regime of men.
The riots occurred in the "HMP Long Lartin" prison at around 09.30 BST on Sunday and will still continue.
In order to prevent disturbances involving eight prisoners who are confined to the same wing, the Special Service staff of "Tornado" were involved.
Light facial trauma was treated at the site of the event.
The representative of the prison department said: "In order to resolve the HMP Long Lartin incident, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to trauma.
We will not be content with violence in our prisons and clearly say that those responsible will be handed over to the police and perhaps spend more time behind the rest."
The "HMP Long Lartin" prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison was being treated in a hospital after the arrest of the prisoner.
And in October last year, the workers responsible for the dumping control were sent to prison to resolve the serious irregularities in which the personnel were attacked with billiard bombs.
Orkáns Roza Phoenix, Lasvegas and Soltleuxtia are threatened with sudden floods (probably affected areas of drought will benefit from the situation)
Arizona is rarely suffering from tropical depression, but it is likely that this will happen early next week, when the Orkan Rosa with the rest of her strength moves across the desert south, creating a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the West of Arizona, on the south and east of Nevada, on the south-east of California and on the south-east of Jutty, including Phoenix, Flagstone, Lasvedas and Soltleichtia.
It is expected that Rosa will move right through Phoenix on Tuesday, when she comes with a matter late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix Twitter reported that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical weather or depression status 200 miles (320 km) from Phoenix!
Katrina in 1967 was an hurricane of 40 miles (65 km) from the AZ borders."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) predict 2 to 4 inches (~5,08 to 10,2 cm) of rainwater, reaching in some places even 6 inches (15,24 cm).
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central part of the Klins Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 1-2 inches (~2,54-5,08 cm), with a total of 4 inches (~10,2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the pink rains can be a blessing because the region has been hit by drought.
Although the possibility of landing causes very serious concerns, some rainstorms may benefit because the south-west is now suffering from drought.
According to the US Drought Monitor, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First of all, Orkan Rosa's path leads to Lower California, Baja California, in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rosa is still with Orkan's strength on Sunday morning at maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km), is about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eigenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico and is heading north at 12 miles (19 km) in the hour.
The wind meets with the cooler waters of the Pacific and is therefore agreed upon.
Therefore, the hurricane is expected to reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the part of the rain gas, Mexico can be strong by creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the rain gas will reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from Lower California in the south-west of Sonora, possibly by reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rosa will move north, across Mexico as a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then cross Arizona and arrive in the south of Jutah late in the evening.
"The main threat expected from the Rose or its residues is very strong rain gas in Lower California, north-west Sonora and the US in the darkest south," said the National Orkan Center.
It is expected that this rain will cause life - threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts, and earthquakes in the mountainous areas.
Attack Midsummer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man were arrested in suspicion of a murder attempt after a 16 - year - old boy with a hole in the door was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4.00 BST.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
The police informed that 17 years of age and two 18 years of age, as well as 20 years of age, were arrested by night, in Redstock, Eivon and Somerset.
The police have called on anyone who could have a mobile phone material for what happened.
Tramps claim that Kaveno is suffering from the "evil and angry" party of the Democrats
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the vicious and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramps announced at a meeting in Willing (Wheeling), West Virginia.
Tramps stressed that Kaveno had suffered from the "evil and angry" party during the entire process of his appointment.
Kaveno showed the Congress where he vigorously and emotionally rejected any Christian Blasey Ford (Christian Blasey Ford) charge of sexual harassment several decades ago when he was a teenager.
Ford also testified during his own charges.
On Saturday, the President announced that "the people of the Americas had seen" the Kaveno "excellence, ability and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a history of service to the people," he announced to the supporters' effort in West Virginia.
President Kaveno mentioned the circumstances in which he spoke about the importance of the activities of Republicans during the interim elections.
"Two weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't expect it, but I did, in fact, run," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Tramps objected that the Democrats had undertaken a mission "to protest and oppose".
It is expected that the first of the main proceedings in the Senate on the appointment of Caven will take place no later than Friday, the CNN informed the senior executive officer of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia, and the number of victims is clearly increasing
On Saturday, officials reported that at least 384 people were killed, many were simply killed when the giant waves hit the shores after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulaves.
On Friday at a festival in the city of Palais, hundreds of people were gathered on the beach, when up to six meters (18 feet) high waves were blowing against the shore in the chair, killing many and killing all who were on their way.
Cunami was raised after 7.5 balloons of strong earthquakes.
"When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still working on the beach and they didn't run away right away, and they became victims," said the representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purvo Nugroho) in a letter in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, it brought cars, balloons and buildings, it dragged everything that was on the ground," Nugoro told, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
"Many people crawled in trees to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Paul.
There are many destroyed homes and shops, deformed and destroyed bridges, and water-encumbered bridges in photographs taken by the disaster agency.
After that, the coastal city continued to tremble on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency highlighted in the BPPT Communication that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was approximately 200 times higher than the energy released by the global second-world war on the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima.
The location of the city was long, possibly at the end of the narrow tower to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho's posts were described as "wide", and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels have been destroyed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of victims and casualties could be larger along the coast line 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in the area called Dongala (Dongala), which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"Communications were completely broken, no information was received from Dongala," Nugroho informed.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross reported, adding that its personnel and volunteers are going to the affected regions.
"Now it's a tragedy, but everything could be worse," the organization informed.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing that the tsunamis had visited Paul, although officials claimed that the waves had arrived at the time of the announcement of the warning.
The video distributed on social networks tells us that the man at the top of the building is called the people on the bottom of the street who are approaching the tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall will strike against the coast, removing buildings and machines.
News agency "Reuters" failed to immediately confirm whether the material is real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of electropaedic power, which turned off Paul’s communication, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials reported that the army had begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other necessities.
The city airport is open only to aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) was planning to visit Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of Indonesia's tsunami exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Mr Doseb (Doseb) said that the World Vision staff who had successfully reached the city of Paul from Dongala, and now, in the ruins of the office, had gone a long way.
"They told us that they saw many buildings that were destroyed," he explained.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams were actively organizing disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to go to Paul with great experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, the financing of foreign organisations, resources and personnel can only take place if the post territory is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a province-level disaster," said the Indonesian Red Cross representative Aulia Ariani (Aulia Ariani).
"When the government announces, 'Well, it is a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international aid, but such status has not yet been established."
When Paul arrived on the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members were still not found, hoping that their love would become a miracle that would make life more brighter during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the shed.
On Sunday, the woman was released safely, and she was put to death by her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano (Gendon Subandano), a coach of the Indonesian national paraglomerates team, had prepared two of the uninvited paraglomerates in Asia, which took place this month in Indonesia.
Other guests from the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their growers.
"As we experienced the paraglider," he said, "I'm learning the burden of emotion."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was distributed by the paragliding team, he sent the "WhatsApp" reports for hours to the participants in the Palais contest who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one sign of the mouse, not two marks of the blue.
"Madam, this means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
The coals broke 26 750 dollars during the filling of the ATM in the "Newport on the Levee" complex
According to the Newport Police Department's announcement, the hostages paid 26 750 dollars on Friday from the morning to the staff of Brink's, who filled the ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The car driver emptied the ATM entertainment complex and had prepared to fill it with more money," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the manager was busy, another person "from the back joined the Brink's employee" and robbed the sum of the money provided by the ATM.
According to the press release, the Witnesses observed several suspects who left their crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about their identities should contact the NYPD 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: the reprisal changes its name to Je
Reperis Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Ye).
When he announced a change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Boutne, who has previously known as Kanji West."
The 41-year-old West was already called Je, and used the name of his eighth album published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance in this "Saturday Night Live," where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
The composers of this song tell us that he replaces the singer Arian Grandi, who has stopped the work of "emotional cause".
Vests has said that it is not only a shortcut to his current professional word, but also a religious one.
"I believe that "Ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You," West explained earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with the radio driver Big Boy.
"Then I am you, I am us, that is us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is thought of good and bad in ours, about our confusion, about everything.
The album is more thought about what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, who had previously been known both as Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Brother Love).
JAY-Z, who had previously cooperated with the West, even though he did not use the thought mark and big letters.
The elected president of Mexico advises not to use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use military force against civilians at the time of the 50th anniversary of the bloody return to the students.
Lopess Obrador said on Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, a peaceful demonstration by the army unit was demolished, killing up to 300 people at the time the left-wing movement of the students spread throughout Latin America.
Lopess Obadors has vowed to support new Mexicans in the years, each month giving grants to students and opening up more public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and education put young criminals in the ranks.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, the clear investor and artistic intellectuals practitioner Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee), who has worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after various US government bodies have made statements about artificial intelligence, although the US as a whole lacks strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, last year China launched its plan: it aims to become the main country in the field of artistic intelligence by 2030.
"The two-fold research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good start, given that all other countries have so far left the United States, and the next cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," Lī said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that double funding could double the possibility that next success in the field of artificial intelligence will occur in the USA.
This month, the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", the Executive Director of Synovation Ventures, who has contributed funds to one of China's most important artistic intelligence companies "Face+".
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon (Karnegi-Melona) University to establish an artistic intellectual system that would cross the Americas' best "Othello" (Revers ) player, but later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
The previous technology competition organised by the U.S. government, such as "Defense Advanced Research Agency's Robotics Challenge", was recognised and asked when it will be prepared next to identify people with ideas about the future.
"Scientists often have to work very hard to obtain government grants," says Li.
"It is not China that attracts leading scientists, but large companies," he explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have paid university fees for the work of artificial intelligence.
Li added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically allocated to people with a degree of philosophy doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese National Council published its next generation's artistic intellectual development plan.
It was explained that the Chinese National Science Fund provides funding for people from academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, but the academic quality of work in China is lower.
This year, the U.S. Defence Department established a single joint artistic intelligence centre, which aims to bring together partners from industrial and academic circles, and White House announced the creation of a special committee on artistic intelligence.
And this month DARPA (Central Research and Development Organization of the U.S. Ministry of Defence) announced a $2 billion investment in the initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Fund, on the other hand, is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, US legislation, whose task was to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not worked for several months.
Macedonians in the referendum on the change of national name
The citizens of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to "the North Macedonian Republic", taking steps to prevent the decades-long disagreements with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasises that the name of its northern neighbour shows claims to its territory and has imposed veto on the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the nationalists in the opposition insisted that the changes affected the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that I will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign with the invitation to boycott has raised concerns about whether the electorate's activity will reach at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The referendum ticket asks: "Are you involved in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), object that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that occurred after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as a member of the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia to be able to live free, in the protection of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgejevska (Oliver Georgievska) in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have announced that they will take account of the outcome of the vote which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, a 2/3 majority will be required in Parliament.
The National Elections Commission informed that no violations had been reported by one afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski (Gjose Tanevski), a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zajevs, his wife Zorica (Zorica) and his son, Dusko, gave his vote in his referendum in Macedonia on the change of the national name which will open the way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica on 30 September 2018 in Macedonia.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov), prepared a small audience and arranged chairs at the tents that had been placed in the referendum boycotts.
"We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with a raised head, not through the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have self-respect.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs argues that NATO will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe most will vote for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after the vote.
He said the result "yes" "will confirm our future."
The last survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research (Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research) on Monday shows that 30 to 43% of the voter will participate in the referendum, less than the required activity.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 per cent of the vote on Sunday was scheduled to take part.
70 percent of them replied that they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electorate's activity must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
See: Manchestras "City" Sergio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) is sailing through all the "Brightton" protection to get the gates
Serhio Agvero and Rahim Sterling (Raheem Sterling) brought the protection of Brighton by allowing Manchester's "City" Saturday at the "Etihad" stadium in Manchester, England to win with 2:0.
Agvero was impressed by the ease of his gates in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian intruder received a hit in the middle of the field at the start of the combination.
He broke out between the three Brighton shields and went into the open field.
Then Agvero hugged four green cracks.
He led the bomb to one guard, then the running power of several more at the edge of the Brighton field.
Then he went to the left and reached Sterling.
The English-speaking center used its first touch to play back Agvero, who put a good football tooth in the case to hit the "Brigton" guard Metju Rayen (Mathew Ryan) on the right side of the network.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," the manager of the city, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
"We talked to them about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were glad he got the gates at the time.
But it was Sterling, who provided the original advantage of Sky Blues in the Premierly Race.
The gate was opened in 29 minutes.
Agvero played the ball in the area of Brighton.
He sent a bomb with a beautiful stone along the left leg of Leroy Sane.
Several seats were made in the river until Sterling was entrusted with delivering the bomb to the next gate stand.
The Sky Blues Center intruder easily entered the bomb network just before crossing the border.
"City" fights with the "Hoffenheim" Champions League games Tuesday at 12.55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinshaim, Germany.
Shercers wants to get the "Rockies" problem.
Since "Nationals" did not participate in exclusion games, there was no reason to restart.
But Chercers (Scherzer), who is always ready to fight, hopes Sunday to use the opportunity against Colorado "Rockies", but only if "Rockies" will be the current exclusion games. And "Rockies" in the National League Western Group is led by one game against Los Angeles Dodgers.
"Rockies" has printed at least a white card with Friday evening with 5:2 winning "Nationals", but still hasn't earned its first title in the division.
"Even if we play the same thing, we will at least be able to have fun knowing that the air here, in Denver, with the effort and second team, will probably be the most hottest thing I'll ever meet this year.
And why wouldn't I want to fight then?"
"Nationals" has not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, as the news says, is ready to let Chercere take the year.
Chercers, who will be at the beginning of 34th, held a four-day session in the outer part of the "bullpen" space, and will throw a bomb during the normal holiday.
Washington labrocis is 18 - 7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 sharps 220 2/3 inches this season.
Tramps hold myths in West Virginia
The president mentioned the situation in which his elected Supreme Court candidate, Brets Kaveno, was involved while discussing the importance of the activities of Republican voters during the interim election.
"Everything we have done is under threat in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It is really very, very serious — I didn't expect it, but I did, and that is why I am everywhere and I am fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramps continued: "You see this horrible, horrible group of radicals that acts right now.
And they have committed themselves to regain power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see the evil, the opposite action.
They have whatever they hurt, they have to break to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't do it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission "to protest and oppose".
"But you have seen the same thing in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "wicked, wicked, disobedient and false."
He called on the Senate Judicial Committee Senator Dianne Feinstein (Dianne Feinstein) of the Democratic Party of the Democratic Party, to which the audience responded with loud calls.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait – it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Liberal Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is irreparable to those who are exposed
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted to subject me to censorship.
Finally, I am the last member of the Parliament of the Libyan Party to date, who has been informed that he is not willing to do so, because we do not conceal our opinion.
My colleagues in parliament, Joan Ryan, treated me the same way, because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, of national security, of Europe, is ironic, but they were issues in which Jeremiah did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement on the Leiborist meeting in the part east of Nottingema said on Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local Lebanese MPs were exactly that.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the air is different and promises of a "better, safer" policy have long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Leiborist party does not want to have different views, and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party.
This began shortly after Jeremiah became the leader: colleagues, whom I think our political views are similar, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept the views I would never otherwise have agreed on – whether it is national security or a single EU market.
When I speak in public — and it is not really important what I say — the following study on the use of social networks, calling for the ban on candidates for the next elections, by reversing the centre's policy, claiming that I have no place in the Leiborist party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more successful than some of my colleagues because my comments are usually political.
I was amazed at the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues, who are confronted with the currents of sexist and racist insults every day, but never hesitated to avoid.
One of the most dissatisfying aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Last week, Jeremiah Corbin announced that the Leiborist party should buy out a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is ready for diversity and with every expression of mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party will be cut short.
In the last two years, I've often been given advice, asking not to go to class, think about what I'm saying, and then with me "everything will be fine."
But that is not why I have decided to take part in politics.
Since I joined the camp for 32 years back as a schoolboy, responding to the rejection of the Teccher government, which had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I have been tasked with fighting for better public services for those who are most needed — both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my political views, including previous elections.
No one in the East had reason to doubt my position on policy issues and in areas where I did not agree with the existing government.
To those who made a proposal Friday, I can only say that when the country went to Brexit firmly, which would harm households, businesses and our public services, I did not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist party.
But essentially the only thing I want to say is not for the Momentum, but for their voters whether they are leiborist members: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I affirm that there is no threat of the denial of running or of reminders that no one in politics will ever stop me from doing what I think is best for you all.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": The unspoken "Ayr" reaches the top row table
The last two attempts could be to some extent met with the final results, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish championship game today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unspoken team of ten.
Finally, it was both their great protection and the use of much better opportunities that drove the owners, and coach Peter Murchie has all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We've checked all our games and we're still not in touch, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Kristius (Robyn Christie): "All respect "Ayr," they used their advantages better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraziers Klimo (Frazier Climo) made "Ayr", but the yellow card of the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was awarded "Warriors", changed the figures of "Melrose", and Jason Baggot, held an unrealized bomb.
The climate increased the management of "Ayr" with the penalty, just at the end of the half-time, he won points, then realized a solo attempt, and thus "Ayr" stopped with 17-5.
But the Melrose half-life began with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Begot realized, reduced the retreat to 5 points.
Then there was a long break because Ruuris Nott (Ruarid Knott) had a severe trauma and was taken to the benches away from the field, but when the game began "Ayr" quickly moved forward when Staford Macdovels (Stafford McDowall) made an attempt to realize Klimo.
The existing captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used a superior player — with Bruce Colvine, which was not realized.
However, the owners settled, and when Struan Hachinson (Struan Hutchinson) received the yellow card for crossing the Klimo without a bomb, from the penal corridor, Makferson carried out an arrest on the back of the "Ayr" mill.
As in the past, it was almost from the very beginning that Kyle Rowe took over David Armstrong's winning field and sent the flag player Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the holdings.
"Still Game" star seems to plan a new career in business
The Ford Kieran (Ford Kieran) star of the "Still Game" comedy series appears to be planning to engage in the business of hospitality, as it was discovered that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis (Jack Jarvis) is playing at the popular BBC show he is making, and is participating with his old partner in the event of Greg Hemphil.
The duets have announced that the next ninth season will be the last one, and Kirnan is obviously planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the Director of Aföringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the "Scottish Sun" source pointed out that Kirnan was planning to participate in the "walking restaurant" of Glázgov.
"The sea belongs to us!": the buried Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrol around the tides of the Starfleet in the Lapas.
Public buildings have raised the green flags of the ocean.
Fleet base ships from Lake Titicaca until the Amazon are dashed by a joke: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In the land of Bolivia, the memory of Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict on the lost coast line is still alive, just as it has been in the Pacific again for a long time.
This hope is likely to be the highest for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice judgment on 1 October of five years after its consideration.
"Bolivia develops, in its own spirit is united and peaceful, and, of course, with positive thoughts, awaits the outcome," said Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla (Roberto Calzadilla).
Many residents will see the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide for the sake of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of negotiations with interruptions, Chile is obliged to discuss a sovereign sea exit to Bolivia.
President Evo Morales, of Bolivia's charismatic local origin, who is waiting for the fight to be postponed next year, is also very interested in the Monday's judgment.
"We are close to getting back the Pacific," he was excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that Bolivia’s judgment of good is unlikely and, even if it is adopted, great changes are not expected.
In the Netherlands, the United Nations based structure does not have the power to allocate Chile’s territory, and its representatives have said that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's judgment is not adopted six months after the final hearing shows that the case was "not difficult", explained international law expert Paza Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And the last four years have gone by, and not by the way; but, on the contrary, they have fallen.
"The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morale’s military rhetoric has obscured the remaining good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to hold the debate.
The two countries have not been exchanged for consignments since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, who was once President Edward Rodríguez Veltz, did not agree that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the possibility of "adding a point to 139 years of conflict, from which both sides will get," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used sea problems as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to know what to do to overcome the past."
North Korea will refuse nuclear weapons only when you can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) said his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during the two country leaders' meeting in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) is ready to resume diplomatic measures to prevent nuclear failure, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leaders, Kim Chenu.
Ri claims that they are "fantasias" to hope that the US still unresolved sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean war will ever leave North Korea on its way.
Washington is careful with regard to the declaration of consent before Phenjana will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kims and US President Donald Trumps want a second meeting.
But many are skeptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up the weapon, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan next month to prepare the next meeting of Kim with Trump.
Paris fashions this is presented with the latest massive headline on the way to you nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown (Thom Browne) presented viewers with a series of absurd, huge head covering items in the spring/summer 2019 season collection, which huddled on the Paris Fashion Week-style background.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing achievements to demonstrate fashion.
Valentino’s most outstanding act was a beautiful purple hat with a colour-like wide border that wrapped its heads.
In the middle of the massive accessories there were precious stones covered with wood, magic hats and even pineapple — but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange mask — right in front of Helovina.
Many of the dyed masks were glistening lips, and they were soon assigned to Hannibal Lekter, not to high - fashion.
One of the structures reminded the breathing skills of diving, with pipes and glasses, while the other resembled the frozen cone.
And if you want to continue in massive fashion, then the real time has come.
Styl's observers believe that huge audacity is possible on your way to the nearest High Street.
The large hats immediately became popular after the appearance of "La Bomba" — the shoulder hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide, all from Rianna, to Emily Ratajovski (Emily Ratajkovski).
The status of very impractical hats as cult objects in all social networks has led to yet another major act on the clay — the salmon beach som, almost as large as the swimwear model that wears it.
The red sum of the yellow aphrodisiac, treated with African barges and equipped with white leather gloves, took place in a spring/summer 2019 collection of the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Lukke Armitage explained FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach sums to appear in the central street shops next summer, because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for a huge amount of accessories."
John Edwards: Language knowledge is important to the world’s citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a reputation for excellent educational institutions, and it has maintained it in 2018, when excellent exams were obtained on a regular basis, which further enhances individual and collective achievements in sports, art and other public events.
The aim of this school, which is taught in Scotland by a total of 30,000 educators, is to provide the best level for their educators and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their life as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that today's languages are still popular and desirable in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to people in the language he understands, it stays in his consciousness.
If you speak his native language, it will remain in his heart."
This is a convincing reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to establish relationships and gain trust in people from other countries.
Given the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league table with the largest number of exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved the highest score.
Scottish Independent Schools Council data for 74 schools show that 72 percent of the students received the highest score in Chinese A and 72 percent of the same score, 69 percent, and 63 percent, respectively, of the Spanish language.
This shows that the support of independent schools in Scotland is foreign as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as an object of choice, are assessed in independent school programmes as high as the objects of a group of science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
In 2014, the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17 percent of employers as a reason for the failure to fill their vacancies mentioned a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming more and more mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
By increasing the opportunities for working with languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will bring them real benefits in the future that such a long - term skill will bring.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a number of languages.
According to the 2013 YouTube survey, involving more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent did not understand foreign language well enough to maintain the conversation, but French was the only language in which the two-digit number was spoken, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today’s children to learn the language of their contribution.
A number of languages, especially the language skills of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in language.
Part of the school will focus more on the most common languages of the day, while others will learn languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for the future of the United Kingdom, according to plans by 2020.
No matter what your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be experts in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing the language environment that will prepare children and will provide them with the skills needed to achieve success in the future.
At present, in the global business environment, languages cannot be denied that they are still vital to the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today's languages would be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It is necessary to do so (It must be done).

Lebron's debut in Lakers' composition Sunday, Sandjego
Fans have finally waited for the moment when Lebron's first game will take place in the composition of Los Angeles Lakers.
Lukke Walton, coach of Lakers, has announced that James will be playing on Sunday's preseason opening game against Denver's "Nuggets" Sandjego.
However, it is still necessary to determine exactly how much time he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton reported on the official website of Lakers.
"Lackers" reporter Mike Trudell on Twitter reported that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
As James continued his practice this week, he asked about his plans regarding the series of six pre-season games by Lakers.
"At this stage of my career I don't need preseason games to prepare," he said.
Trampa myth in West Virginia Time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trumps is starting a series of myths today in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned trampla mines next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his choice to fill the free space in the Supreme Court has been suspended, the purpose of the trampa is to obtain support for the forthcoming elections, as there is a risk that the Republics will lose control of the Congress after the vote was taken in November.
What is going to happen today in Trampa’s West Virginia residence, and how can it be viewed online?
Trampa residence in Vilnius, West Virginia is scheduled for seven evenings, after ET today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Tramp myths in the West Virtue You can watch online on YouTube.
Tramps is likely to be talking about hearing this week in Breta Caveno, the Supreme Court candidate, who has committed sexual crimes and is expected to vote in the Senate to postpone approval for a week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
However, the main objective of this myth is to help improve the situation for the Republicans, which are expected to be elected in November.
Therefore, the campaign by President Tramp shows that this next week's five minutes is the task of "activizing volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority belonging to them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control for his agenda is so important that the president will visit the state as much as possible, because we are launching the active campaign season," said Trampa campaign representative, who did not want to reveal his name, Reuters.
This evening's residence, which is planned for "Wesbanco Arena" in Vilnius, is likely to attract supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania, and will be reflected in Pittsburgh's media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Tramps is trying to help the candidate for Patrick Morrisey, a senator of West Virginia, who remains in line with the polls.
"It's not a good sign to Morise that the president has to come to help improve his findings in the polls," said Professor Simon Haeder of Political Science at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Radio fight 2018: The United States has demonstrated its commitment to fight to keep a great hope for Sunday singles.
After three sessions in "one word" the afternoon game in the form of "foursome" was possible exactly what this Raider cup required.
Sportsmen love to talk about success fluctuations, and they really believe in it, especially in competitions like these.
So, which side do you think they're making now?
"They were in charge with six points, but now with four, as I think it means in its own sense that success has turned towards us," said Jordan Spyts (Jordan Speeth).
Europe, of course, is in favour because it is in charge of 4 points, but 12 more will be played.
Spyt explained that the Americans believe that the wind blows in their cages and they have reason to be optimistic, of course, also in Spyta and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast with three points out of four.
Spy has been destructive from the first seat to the hall, and is an example of the winner.
Those guitarist bells became louder as his rounds continued, the decisive sitin was made in the court to reach four times the same number of sitins when he and Thomas had left for two sitins after two.
His seat in the fortress, which won his victory 15 , was perceived with a similar call, of them, for his conviction that the American team has not yet been exonerated.
"And really have to burn deep, and worry about your cat," Spyts said.
That's all that's left to these players.
18 minutes to make a success.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spyts and Thomas are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter this Rayder case history.
European strangers, but the attractive couple are left behind by four points and will not be able to harm.
Molivuds was the only couple who went out on Saturday afternoon without bogies, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and in the last nine mornings on Friday mornings.
This move and how their energy flows to this frightening effort and once again convinces them that they are the players to win on Sunday, and Fleetvods with Molinari will be the most popular players who can ensure a potential European victory when the sun goes through Le Golf National.
At the same time, both of us would like to be together in a variety of ways.
However, the talks about the European triumph were premature.
Babba Vatson (Bubba Watson) and Webb Simpson (Webb Simpson) were quickly confronted with this morning's fourball hero Sergio Garcia (Sergio Garcia), who played with Alex Noren.
Bogius and the two double front nine brought Spain and Sweden to the cheese, and they were not even close to cultivating it.
But there is no one on Sunday to help us get through it.
The games in fourball and foursome formats are so exciting to watch in the vicinity because of the interaction, to see what advice they give, and not, and how the strategy can change the situation in the future.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and before the last few days it is in the long run, but this foursome game has shown that the US team is committed to fighting, which many, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
European Selection on the last day of the Raider case is under control 10-6
The European election will start on the last day of the Raider Cup in a pleasant run after Saturday's fourball and foursome competition ended with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and French Molinar (Francesco Molinari) were led by two victories over the heavy-working Tiger Woods, which increased the number of "Le Golf National" to four.
Tomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) European team to preserve the trophies lost by Hazeltine two years ago dominated the unprecious American team in the morning game in the form of fourballs, and the result of the series became 3-1.
The United States was more energetic in the form of foursomes, winning two cats, but was unable to eliminate the deficit.
The Jim Farik (Jim Furyk) team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 games to keep the trophy.
Flyingwood is the first European year that won four points in a row with Molinar, to be nominated for Mollivud ("Molliwood") after a sensational weekend is only a second couple in the history of Raider's cup, which won four points in the first four matches.
In the form of "fourballs" in Patrick Reed, they then beat Braison Deshambo (Bryson Dechambeau) with an even more sensitive result of 5&4.
The Woods, which had two games on Saturday, showed a great game for moments, but he lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before morning's "fourballs", returned to partner Henrik Stanson's "foursomes" to say with 2+1 Dastin Johnson and Brooks Koopa, who will take the first and second place in the world ranking.
Europe failed to achieve its full potential, although the day in the south-west of Paris was a pleasant and quiet breeze.
The three-fold winner of the prestigious golf competition Jordan Spyts and Justin Thomas set the stage for two-point Americans on Saturday.
They printed 2&1 against Spanish John Ram (Jon Rahm) and Ian Poulter (Ian Poulter) in "fourballs" format and returned later to call polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after losing the first two bets.
Only two times in the history of the Raider Cup team has played 4 points in the missing games, but as owners, the Farika (Furyk) team is only enough with an undisclosed result to preserve the trophy.
After being in the second place two days, it seems that the attack on Sunday will be problematic.
North Korea announced that in the case of "no" it would not be unilaterally untrustworthy
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had deepened its mistrust to the United States, and North Korea would never, in such a situation, unilaterally refuse its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the World's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had achieved "significant good will steps" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing and the promise never to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate US response," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the US, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never be the first to unravel unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean legacy of Washington's opposition to the "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, according to which Korea would be compensated for the steps taken, his statement left the impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization as Phenjana had done before.
Ri referred to the joint announcements of Kim Čenun and Donald Tramp in the first post of the US President and North Korean leader at a meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work to achieve "the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has officially tried to end the Korean War from 1950 to 53, but the United States has announced that Phenjan must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also failed to accept the call to facilitate serious international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that "denoclearisation must be first", and increases the level of pressure created by the sanctions to achieve the goal of power, even objecting to "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could force us on our way is empty fantasies that people are laughing at us who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri did not discuss the intentions of the second meeting of Kim once with Trump, whose leader in the United States had specifically mentioned in the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister particularly highlighted three meetings of Kim with South Korea's leader Munu Jaein (Moon Jae-in) over the past five months and added: "If the other party were South Korea on this denouncing issue rather than the United States, the denouncing of the Korean peninsula would not have come in such a way."
However, Ri’s tone of speech was dramaticly different from last year’s statement in the United Nations General Assembly that the admission of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States is inevitable after the “Launis President Tramps” had called Kim on the mission of the “roachman”.
This year, the United Nations Tramps, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done, and sanctions must be kept until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday Trump announced that he did not plan a specific time, stressing that "or it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjan for his achievements.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Council's sanctions must be energetically continued, without allowing errors until final and convincing denouncing is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced the sanctions since 2006 in an effort to cut the funding of the Phenjan nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then informed that he would visit Phenjan again next month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trips were not successful.
He left Phenjana in July, saying that progress has been made, but North Korea has already accused him of "gangter's honorable requirements" after a few hours.
North Korea's meeting with Muna this month committed itself to dismantling the weapon's polygon and also the nuclear complex if the United States does "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed her that "appropriate measures", which North Korea wants to see, are security guarantees that Tramps promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard University will learn a lesson about how to get sufficient rest
The new subject of education at Harvard University this year has become that students are sleeping more, and it is an attempt to turn against the increasingly popular culture of brutality, which includes over-filled caffeine study for nights.
One speaker found that the world’s best university students often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Brigham and the United States.
He was inspired to create a new subject of learning after he spoke about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"A girl came to me and said, "Why is it telling me just now that I'm in the last class?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year’s first release of the lecture, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sport achievements and improve general well-being.
Paul Bareira (Paul Barreira), professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University Health Services, informed that the university decided to introduce a course after learning that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
An interactive series of tasks shall be included in the training process for hours.
One of the parts is a picture of co-dwelling doors where students click on coffee bags, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light and how performance affects sleeplessness and how important it is to sleep.
In another part, students are informed of how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how health will affect cigarette smoking," added Professor Cheisler.
He said that a culture that boasts the ability to learn all night still exists, and added that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that the lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that sufficient quality sleep provision must be the student's "blind weapon" to combat stress, stress and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, as the lack of sleep changes the brain in the hunger mode, making them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to develop the subject of study after attending one of his professor's lectures last year, Harvard in the first course.
He said that the subject of the study had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who receive post-graduate education to get a similar programme before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Cheisler advises students to install the module not only for the time they get up, but also when they go to bed, as well as to keep in mind how people damage the "green lights", which are emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lamps, because they can break daily rhythms by making it difficult to sleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Men's gates are beating Gerard's viruses
"Rangers" was looking for another sad game of guests when Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) was the site of Steven Gerard (Steven Gerrard's cover team decided 1 - 0 for the loss of Livingston.
The "Ibrox" team was hoping to win the first victory since February 4:1 the St Johnstone triumph, but the Gerija Holt (Gary Holt) team won his second loss in 18 games, since he became the club manager, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish championship leader "Hearts".
Menga entered the ball at the door seven minutes before the end of the half-time, and the lack of the "Rangers" inspiration did not look at anything after trying to balance the result.
"Rangers" falls to the sixth place, while "Livingston" rises to the third, and in terms of gate difference it can only be "Hibernian".
And "Rangers" could be another problem, because the judge's assistant Calum Spence needed medical attention due to a head trauma, which was apparently caused by the rest of the artefact.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind the back of "Ayr", reaching the Betfred cupboard semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same "Livingston" 11 players, who took one point "Hearts" last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-designed team printed opponents in each episode.
The Rangers may have managed the bomb more frequently, but Livingston made better use of what they did.
They had to get the gates two minutes after Menga's first game sent Scott Pittman towards Alan McGregor's (Allan McGregor) gate, but the center player is running his big opportunity for a long time.
Then the far-off of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner, Alan Litgov, was able to shoot a bomb just for a long time behind bars.
"Rangers" took control, but there was an impression that the last third is expected to be played, not believed it will happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) undoubtedly believed that he should have had a sentence in 15 minutes, after he had met Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected the Colombian invitation.
"Rangers" carried out only two sites in the first half, but the former "Ibrox" guard Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed, nor was Lassana Kulibali (Lassana Coulibally) a site with a head, nor was Ovi Edžaria (Ovie Ejaria) a decent end of the attack.
Although "Livingston" started in 34 minutes may have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they had already earned it for their efforts.
"Rangers" was no longer in touch with Jacob's long combination.
Scott Erfilds (Scott Arfield) did not respond when Declan Galagher (Declan Gallagher) broadcast a bomb to Scott Robinson (Scott Robinson), who maintained balance and chose Meng for a simple ending.
Gerard stopped Kulibali replaced with Ryan Kent, and it affected the game almost immediately, because the semi-guard sent the bomb Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line was about to block.
But "Livingston" continued to make guests play as they liked to, Lithuania and Halket performing one long sit-in after another.
Holta's team could have continued the lead in the final phase, but Makgregor played well when he stopped Jacobs before Lithuania took a stone from the corner.
"Rangers" replacement Glens Midleton (Glenn Middleton) later requested another sentence, after having clashed with Jacobs, but Tomson's request was again ignored.
Almanahs: Geigera counter inventor
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanah: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany, Johannes Wilhelm "Hanss" Geiger was born, who grew up as a physicist.
Geigers developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, as a result, in the end, was a device known as Geigera's numerator.
In science, the player who took his place and retained Geiger also took his place in pop culture, such as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado" (Koronado calls), where the main roles were played externally by cowboy scientists Rogers and Deils Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It is Geiger's numerator used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these ears on, you can hear how the atoms are working because of this mineral's radioactivity."
Evans: "Indeed, it's really bird!"
Hans Geigers died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that he called his name continues to live on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them
Vaccine therapy teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells
Using this method, the patient receives immune system cells that are converted into a laboratory
Then they could see a protein that is typical of many malignant tumours and will be injected back into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of malignant tumours.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognise bad cells experienced the loss of her ovaries for more than 18 months.
The method is to obtain from the patient's immune system cell by converting it into a laboratory to be able to "monitor" several tumour-like protein HER2 and then inject these cells back into the body.
U.S. National Cancer Institute (US National Cancer Institute) in Betasd (Bethesda), Maryland Professor Jay Berzovsky (Jay Berzofsky) said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of several types of malignant tumours," including breast, ovaries, lungs and intestine cancer, Professor Berzovskis explained.
Similarly, when the patient receives immunosystem cells that were "learned" to attack malignant tumour cells, there has been a single type of leukaemia.
Kanje West after visiting SNL, dressed in MAGA hats, attacked Trampa critics.
It didn't end well
The study of "Saturday Night Live" in Kanje West was held during an independent presidency in which he celebrated President Donald Trump of the United States and announced that he was candidates for the 2020 President's election.
At the end of the third song last night, which was called "Ghost Town", during which he wore the hats "Make America Great", he began to bluff the sound phrases about the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
"It is so many times when I talk to white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I were to act on racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a sermon with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood Star challenged the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Judicial Committee on the charge of Christian Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, a comic book by Chris Rock (Chris Rock) was loaded with Vesta’s favorite social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to get married like this.
And Vests also felt pity for the viewers because he had been ill - treated in the back of his head.
"They laughed at me in the back!
They said, "Don't get out there with that hat in your head!"
They made me laugh!
And they also said that I've lost the connection to reality," West said, according to Washington Examiner.
The wedding continued: "Getting to see what's going on when the relationship with reality is lost?" and promised to draw on "your Superman's hug," because that means that you can't tell me what to do.
Try love!"
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the audience's confusion at least twice, but the members of the team looked sauls, and at least one person told the press the story: "The study was filled with complete silence."
The wedding had recently been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago by a friend of the rapist Max Miller (Mac Miller).
The Vests raped many with a song (I Love it), which he performed in the champagne bottle suit.
The wedding was supported by the conservative TPUSA leader, Kandance Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most powerful people: PATEICOS, WHAT DO YOU DON'T DO?"
However, on the website of the show manager, Karen Hunter, Twitter reported that the West simply "was what he is, and it's wonderful."
"But I choose not to hire a person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "art") who, as I think, supports and beats with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before this show reprisal on Twitter, he announced that he has changed his name by saying that he has now become "a being known as Kanji West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's acting like Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was before Snoop Lion, and, of course, the ignorant legend Prince, replaced his name with a symbol, but then on "a spectator who was once known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder at Belfast's restaurant
A 45 - year - old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was found in the restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The police informed that the incident occurred in Balihackamore (Ballyhackamore).
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the Court of Belfast on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will examine the complaints.
"Tron games" star Other Herringtons directed against toxic manhood
Another Herrington is known as the toothfishing John Snow HBO in the ugly mid-time fantasy series "The Throne Games".
However, a 31-year-old actor has turned against a brutal hero’s stereotype, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think they have to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kits explained that he thought he had "received the problem", and asked how to deal with toxic manhood in #MeToo era.
Another who recently got married to his "Tronus Games" partner Rose Leslie (Rose Leslie), also 31 years of age, admitted that he felt that this problem was important to him.
"I can't think right now about what mistakes we've made with manhood," he said.
"What do we teach young men in this aspect of the problem when they grow up taking into account the present problem?"
Others believe that television with its very male characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic manhood.
He continued, "What is born, but what is taught?
What is taught in TV and in the streets that make young ones feel that they need to be viewed as men?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Because with young men there are clearly problems."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any "Tron Games" continuation or prefabrication, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the fighting fields and horses are abstinuous".
Starting in November, Kits will play the main role in the renewed Sam Shepard True West, which is a story about film producer and his brother's kidnapper.
The shareholder recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife Rose as the best thing that happened to her as a result of the "Tronus Games".
"I met my wife on this one, because it in itself provided my present family and my life from that moment on," he said.
Rosa Emmy won the fantasy series. Other character John Snow's favorite Igrit.
In June 2018, a couple visited the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen by 14% rapidly.
Health care officials report that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, which shows changes.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly as a result of some of Chinese blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in such a way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials reported at the conference in Junnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000 per year in China.
HIV transmission as a result of gender is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but LGBT is said to be often discriminated against.
Based on national conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficiently protected sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised the availability of general HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxina Votersa denies that the employee has leaked the data of Republican senators, turning to "dangerous lies" and "consistency theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives Maxine Waters rejected claims that her staff member had published personal information from three US senators on Wikipedia's websites.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that claims were spread by the "ultra good" media and internet sites.
"Mells, lies and even more ridiculous lies," Twitter posted on his website.
It is reported that the information contained includes the addresses and telephone numbers of the United States Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Juts.
Information online appeared Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, during the hearing of the Senate group on the charges against the Supreme Court of Bret Caveno in sexual misconduct.
The flood occurred some time after the three senators questioned Caveno.
The conservative, internet sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records is related to the Waters office, and revealed information about the staff of the Waters staff, Hills reported.
"This unwarranted claim is absolutely false and completely false!" put on Waters.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by this false and false claim is in no way responsible for the leak of information.
This unwarranted claim is absolutely false and completely false!"
Votersa's statement soon led to online criticism, including the criticism of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer (Ari Fleischer).
"This is an angry denial," Flesher wrote.
"It leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not match the Congressman.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be a warrior.
He must not speak of the accused’s motives.
He must have peace and a frame."
The task of the Fleissera was to compare the Votters' reaction to the democratic fall of Judge Kaveno, who was accused of being too angry during a Thursday hearing.
Omars Navarro (Omar Navarro), a Republican candidate, who is running to get Votersa to lose his seat at the middle of the election, also said his thoughts on Twitter.
"Excellently, if it matches the truth," he wrote.
In his statement, Votersa informed that her cabinet had warned the officials and law enforcement bodies responsible of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all their works that are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
John Anglis 3 — Rovana Atkinson’s exhibition on mirrors
It has become common to search for association with Brexit in every new film with a British cover, and this seems also to apply to this one who has survived, the French-speaking comedy of Johnny England (Johnny English), which started in 2003 with "John England" and was born in 2011 with "John England returns".
Is there a new export option for our nation for itself, for how clearly we are invincible?
In any case, the unqualified Jonnie Anglim with selected eyes and unusually moving face has the right to create a post-resurrection position — his name is more than any other signal that he is a broad spectrum comic character developed in areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent, who, despite his strange claims of roundness, is a little Kluzo, a little Mr Bín, and a little guy who plays one song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games of London's "Chariots of Fire" theme.
He is also based on the traveller and the international, unmistakable personality that Atkinson once pictured in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisements, where he left chaos on his way.
Johnny's latest experience in England has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Anglis goes on a helicopter suit in a medium-time armored suit, and the propeller blades are turning against his skull for a while.
The humour is quite weak and strange on the surface, especially because "serious" cinema brands such as "007" and "Impossible mission" are used by the comedy itself with conviction as one of the ingredients.
Humor creates the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and I don't think Johnny England's absurd remains are as creative and objective as Atkinson's mémo movie tricks in Bina's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain has become a serious mess.
Cyberhacker has entered the super-blind Internet network of Britain, discovering the identity of British agents in all these areas, as a pitiful active agent, a pitiful little Kevin Eldon (Kevin Eldon).
This is the last psalm for the Prime Minister, the pumpoz and the man of conflict who has already lost full political popularity: Emma Tomson is doing what he can with Teresa Meja, but in the scenario there is not much to work with.
In the field of research, her advisors inform that since all the active pressures have been discovered, she will have to call on someone who has retired already.
And this man is the unmistakable Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and we are learning how to work as a secret agent (a couple of friendly jockeys), because Anglis offers to learn the spy profession from the very foundations.
England is being returned to the extraordinary meeting of Vihitol and joined by his once many injured assistant Bo, who is also playing Ben Miller (Ben Miller).
Because now a married man is married to a commandant of the submarine, a friendly person who becomes important only at the end of the movie — a role that Vicki Pepperdaina (Vicki Pepperdine) has not been fully used.
And so, with Robin's huge mistake in serving her in the secret service, Batman has returned and met the beautiful deceased woman of Ophelius Lodi, named Olga Kirylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has put in danger the charismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Volt whose image is Jack Leissy (Jake Lacy), and he claims to be able to solve the British computer cache.
Anglis and Bo start their passionate jokes: they masked themselves as officers, they burn down a fine French restaurant; they create a complicity to enter Volta luxury yachts; and Anglis causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual realities on the head display to get to know the interior of the Volta building.
Everything is done at the end, but to the extent that the film is attractive and funny, it has a lot of children's television elements.
A lot of measured elements.
Like the other Johnny England movies, I can't believe that the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would fully use his talent?
The Leiborist Party rejects plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive pay in five days
Jeremy Corbina (Jeremy Corbyn) The Leiborist Party is preparing to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants company leaders to grant workers, saved through the artificial intelligence revolution, to give them another holiday.
In that case, employees will be able to enjoy the end of three days of the week, at the same time receiving the same wage as before.
Avoti tells us that the idea will "response" the party's agenda in the economy and plans to change the economy for those who work well.
The four-day shift has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it to be an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic changes.
One of the highest-ranking representatives of the Leiborist Party reported "The Sunday Times": "It is expected that policy changes will be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen in one day, but it's an idea for four days' work week that meets the party's goal of balancing the economy for good workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party in industry."
The Leiborist Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has already promised to implement the 2017 general election campaign for four days.
However, the Leiborist Party as such is currently not supporting these hungers.
The representative of the Leiborist Party reported: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
The Finnish cabinet minister, John McDonnell, used a leiborist conference last week to give his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Macdonela explained that he was committed to withdrawing the power for "directors mass" and the public service company "speculators".
The Finnish Cabinet Minister's plan also means that the existing average shareholders of the water companies may not recover their entire package because the Lebanese government could implement the "report" due to the injustices allowed.
He also approved plans to include working companies in the boards and set up exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the private sector company's capital to employees who would receive up to 500 pounds each year in dividends.
Lindsey Grems and John Kennedy answer "60 minutes", or the FBI investigation into the Kaveno case could change their opinion
The investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises a question as to whether the findings of the office could cause a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60-minute news correspondent, Scott Pelley, interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could find out something that would allow them to change their mind.
Kennedy left the impression of a person more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, in the course of the hearing procedure, that I spoke to Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and unconvincing."
However, the vote by Grema is obviously put in the stone.
"I have made a decision on Brett Caveno, and there will be a pressing charge," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brets firmly rejected it," Grems added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names could confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change to be expected."
What is the World Citizens’ Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be a World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and a mission as well: reducing poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will meet in the Great Wall of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances such as Genettes Jackson, Cordi B (Cardi B) and Sean Mendes, but also to increase their understanding of the real goal of the event, which is the end of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event set up by the Global Poverty Project International Defence Group, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this measure (unless there was a wish to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a telephone call or any other important activity to promote understanding of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, which has remained for 12 more years to achieve?
Is the idea of awarding with free concerts a good way to convince people to act, or just another so-called "clickivism" case when people think they really can influence by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter report?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million of its supporters in an effort to achieve different objectives.
It informs that these activities have helped world leaders to report on commitments and policies equivalent to more than US$ 37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from activities for which at least US$ 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership of investors and implementing partners established in the United Kingdom who committed to "help children grow up fully", promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's incomplete diet after receiving more than 4700 Twitter reports from the world's citizens.
"With the UK government, donors, other national governments and the world's citizens such as your support, we can leave incomplete social injustices in the history of our diet," at a London concert in April 2018, Treisija Ulmena (Tracey Ullman) announced.
The group also mentioned that, after more than 5000 measures were launched, when the UK Government called on mothers and children to provide better food, the government announced the allocation of funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide food to 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website -- "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" commented: "It will be a long and long way in which we will have to deal with failures.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-party movements have done so before us, so we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae (Janelle Monae) are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Fernes (Deborra-Lee Furness) and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use war fleets to "block" to delay Russian energy exports – the Minister of Home Affairs claims
"If necessary," Washington could use its war fleet to delay Russia's entry into the market, including in the Middle East," said US Interior Minister Rains Zinke (Ryan Zinke), quoted as saying "Washington Examiner".
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, particularly in places where it operates under the legitimate invitation of the government, are a challenge for research into new energy markets.
"I think the reason why it is in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy just as it does in Eastern Europe — in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its military fleet, can ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the public who had come to visit the action taken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit organisation that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to addressing the situation in Russia and Iran, indicating that they are actually equal.
"The economic opportunity of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and substitution," he said, referring at the same time to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent only on fossil fuels.
More claims that the Trampa administration promotes liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, thus replacing Russia with a much cheaper choice for consumers in Europe.
For this reason Trampa administration officials and also US President Donald Tramps are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" "Nord Stream 2" gas management project that would make Berlin "dependent" by the name of Trampa from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the $11 billion worth of North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which doubles the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlis believes that the Washington burning opposition project is simply based on economic reasons and is an unfair example of competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Minister Alexander Novaks after a meeting in Moscow in September with US Minister of Energy Riku Perij.
The US has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Industry Organisation — the German Industrial Federation (BDI) — has called for the United States to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a great problem if a third country was involved in our energy supply," said German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, director of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) Dieters Kempfs.
Senator Elizabette Vorena will seriously consider his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
The Senate of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Vorena, announced on Saturday that it was serious to consider running for the presidency post after the mid-term elections.
At the House meeting in Holioque, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering candidates for the President's election.
"And the real time to have women in Washington who will "save" the incomplete government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in the newspaper "The Hill".
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidacy in the election of the President of the United States."
During the House's meeting, Warren referred to President Donald Tramp, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Vorena has openly criticised Tramp and his elected Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno.
On Friday's Twitter report, Vorena said, "Of course, before the elections, there is a need for an investigation of the FIB."
However, the survey published on Thursday found that most of Vorana’s supporters did not consider that she should run for the 2020 election.
According to the results of the Boston Globe Political Research Centre/University of Sufol University, fifteen-eight percent of the "possible" electors of Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not run the election.
Thirty-two percent supported such a decision.
The results revealed that more support had been given by former Governor Devals Patricks, receiving 38 percent of the candidate's election and 48 percent against.
In the context of the possible candidate year 2020, the names of the members of the Democratic Party as former Vice-President Joe Baidens and Senator Bernie Sanderss appear in the high profile.
The news agency Associated Press informed that Baidens was committed to making an official decision by January.
Sarah Pelina quotes Treka Pelina PTSS Donald Tramp in her home
Treks Pellins (26) spent the year in Iraq following the call of the cardinals in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"To whom my own son goes through, to whom he goes through after his return, I can extend to other families who face the consequences of PTSS and some of the dose vulnerabilities that our soldiers return to," she told the public at Donald Trump's home in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pelina called her arrest "a obvious problem that everyone seems invisible" and said to her son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little different, they are returning patiently, they are returning wondering whether they are being appreciated by their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all the other members of the military field have given to this country."
According to the representative of the Vasil Police Department Den Beneta, he was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and accused of violence in the family concerning women and the holding of arms while in a state of violence.
18 states, Colombia area met a challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian area support a legal challenge to a new US policy that prevents asylum victims fleeing the gang or violence in the family.
The representatives of the 18 states and the Colombian area in Washington presented a brief statement to the court council on Friday to support asylum seekers facing the obstacles created by that policy, "NBC News".
The full name of the applicant, Grace v. Sessions, in the case that the American Civil Liberties Union began in August against the federal policy was not revealed.
She claimed that her partner "and the son of her violent gang member" abused her, but the US officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Greece described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers, as the countries where the problem is widespread are gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed non-documented immigrants fleeing the family from violence to seek asylum.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the Colombian District, Karl Racín, announced that the new policy "Ignorates national, federal and international laws imposed by decades of law".
"Federal law provides that all requests for asylum are dealt with in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and that such an obstacle violates this principle," the judge's brief statement said.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his statement that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country is damaging to the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sesjons (Jeff Sessions) addressed immigration judges with the request no longer to grant asylum to victims of violence and gang abuse.
"The assistance is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of their race, religion, nation, belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Seshons said in his statement on 11 June concerning politics.
The asylum has never been designed to deal with all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Struggling rescue efforts by the number of people who have fallen into the search process
The situation became more and more difficult for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, calming her pregnant baby in the city's evacuation centre.
"For a minute, the rapid medical assistance service introduces new victims.
Clear water is scarce."
The people were visible when they returned to their destroyed homes and moved into the water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals suffering from an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Haris (Dwi Haris), who had a vertebral column and a shoulder, slept outside the Pale Army hospital, where patients were cared for outside of the indomitable force due to pregnancy.
His eyes burst with tears, remembering how a powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was stuck in a wall drain," the news agency Associated Press said to Harris, noting that his family had arrived for marriage in the city.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of attempting to promote advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came with four pages of long advertisements, highlighting the mutual benefits of the US and China trade, the US Ambassador accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the annex paid by China Day in the state of Aiova's most sold "Des Moines Register", accusing China of attempting to interfere with the U.S. Congress' election on 6 November, but China rejects it.
The fraud complaint that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US will marked what US officials told the news agency Reuters, that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an increasing trade war, thus applying a series of tariffs to each other.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed at exporters in states such as the one in Aiov, which supported the Trampa Republican party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terij Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Aiov, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion on Sunday's edition "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this ban by putting propaganda advertisements into our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses for its own good the so-called freedom of speech and free press tradition of putting paid advertising "Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find a limited number of different views here in Beijing, and you will not see the true reflections of such different views that Chinese people may have in relation to the worrying economic trajectory of China, given that the media is here under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He noted that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans that are depriving women voters of mid-term elections involving the Kaveno scandal
As many leading republics support and defend the Brett Kavanaugh candidate for the Supreme Court, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that the expected mid-term elections will have a negative reaction, particularly on the part of women.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high, and most of the Republicans have already been ready to deliver their votes.
Such things cannot be undone, "The Hill told Professor of Science at the University of Syracuse, University of Maxwell School of Science, Grant Reeher.
Rühers questioned that the recent encouragement of Senator Jeff Fleik (R-Arizona) to conduct a FIB investigation would be quite a reason to calm the angry voters.
"You will not forget what happened yesterday. You will not forget it either tomorrow or November," according to Washington, D.C. on Friday, Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior advisor and national representative of the progressive movement "MoveOn" said.
On Friday morning, the protestors of the Senate, in the main protest, sang "Novembris comes!" when the Republicans under the authority of the Court Committee, chose to continue with the nomination of Kaveno, despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," reported the independent political analyst St. Rothenberg (St. Rothenberg).
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among urban-based, flexible voters and younger voters (aged 18 to 29 years), who often do not go to elections even if the President does not like it."
Even before the Forda's public testimony, in which she stated allegations of sexual violence on the part of the Supreme Court candidate, analysts failed if the Republicans continued to apply for this candidacy.
"The party of those Republicans has become a jeerous mess," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republicans at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Kaveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, who is leading this group, helping to elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans have been a little divided with regard to those who believe in Forda and Kaveno's testimonies, a little more attempting to believe the latter.
The new survey "YouGov" shows that 41 per cent of respondents are either definitely or mostly inclined to believe in Forda's testimony, while 35 per cent claim that they are definitely or mostly inclined to believe in the Caven's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Kaveno may have lied about his testimony until only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Fleika's encouragement, the FIB is currently investigating the claims made by Forda, as well as at least one other defendant — Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Forda pointed out to the Senate Judicial Committee that, at the age of 17, Kaveno was drunk against his sexual assault.
Ramirez states that during the course of his studies, a candidate for the Supreme Court’s office in Jeil in 1980 was shown to her by her generals.
Global Web Designer plans to start a new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tims Børnerss-Lī (Tim Berners-Lee), a global web designer, launches a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project "Inrupt" of the Legend of Technology is a company based on the open source platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Childrenss-Li joked that "Inrupt"'s secret intention is "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The use of Solid technology is used to enable people to create their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like, if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available simultaneously in one browser.
The personal online data storage is unique in that only the user determines which and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal powers using data".
According to the company manager John Bruce (John Bruce), the idea of "Inrupt" is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make "Solid" available to everyone.
The company is currently operating a security platform purchased by Childrenss-Li, Bruce, IBM, some external developers dedicated to the project, and a voluntary community of encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the "Inrupt" website.
Children's-Li said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes during one night completely turning all their business models.
"We don't ask for his permission."
The "Medium" platform, published on Saturday, Childrenss-Li, said that "Inrupt" "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid".
In 1994, Childrenss-Li transformed the Internet into a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Childrens-Li has had an influential view in the discussions on the neutrality of the network.
Even after the launch of "Inrupt" Childrenss-Li will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web age," said Childrenrs-Li.
Bernard Vann: Marking of the Victorian Cross granted to the priest during World War I
For 100 years now, in its hometown, the event has been marked by the fact that the only priest of the Church of England has received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter.
Colonel Bernard Vens received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglies and Lehaukort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know of the highest British military award.
On Saturday in Rašden, Northamptonshire, her two little children discovered a stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "scattered symbolically", that such a stone was discovered just 100 years after his grandfather received a significant award.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vens led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the very frequent fog and large fires and fireworks."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and with the utmost confidence led this line forward before the reception of the large-scale zone, where he won three groups.
Colonel Venu killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Vens (72) said that his grandfather's action was "a murder that I could never do, and that at the same time is also a very humble action".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also spent their debts in the Bentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vens claimed that the feelings were "honored by participating in this show", and noted that "the value of the hero shows the support of many people".
MMA fans waited all night "Bellator 206", but instead of waiting for the Pig Pepu
Imagine being spent all night watching "Bellator 206", but at the end of this main event has been denied to you.
There were 13 fights in Sanhos, including six main maps that were broadcast online all night long in the United Kingdom 5th Canal.
At 6:00 p.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to stand up against each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised by the sudden change in the transmission to Cúcius Pepu.
Some did not really understand when the whole night was all the way down to the dawn of the morning, waiting for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the transmission change to children's multifilm as "successful joke".
"The government has determined that the content of this kind is not acceptable after 6.00, so the transmission to the children's programme took place," explained Dev Schwartz (Dave Schwartz), the senior vice president of marketing and communication.
"Fuck Pepa," "yes."
The president of the company "Bellator" Scott Kokers (Scott Coker) said he was working on schedule planning so that visitors in the United Kingdom could see these broadcasts.
"I think we can sort it out," Kokers said, thinking about retransmission.
"But the clock is there six in the morning, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many texts appeared after the transmission, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical error.
But that wasn't it, the government controlled it.
I can assure you that there will be no such problem next time.
We will hold on to five fights, not six (as it has been so far), but we will try to please fans, but concentrate.
It's a bad situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Toms Daily doesn't feel good enough for her sexuality
The Olympic kidney Tom Deilley (Tom Daley) claims that he grew up feeling less valuable than others because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man didn't realize that "not all are like me" until he started attending high school.
During the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs", led by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "probation".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the long-term programme, has been in pain for several months.
As it turned out, in Laverne's first programme, Deilius said that as he grew, he felt "lesser" than others, because "the society did not accept that it could suit both girls and boys".
He said: "Even today, I feel that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, has been the main engine that has given me the strength and stamina to achieve success."
He said he wanted to prove that there was a "killing" to keep people from hoping when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-level leader of the LGBT campaign and has used his appearance in the Considiary Games of this year in Australia, calling for more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he decided to talk to the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without any difficulty, and wanted to give a "voice" to others.
The world’s three-time champion said that love for a man in the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was "surprisingly unprepared".
Deilius, a 20 - year - old Oscar Prize winner, claimed that the age difference had never been an obstacle.
"When you have gone through so much at such a small age" (his first Olympic games were at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone at your age who had experienced similar tops and falls.
A couple named Robert Reys Black-Deilis (Robert Ray Black-Daley) said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"All that mattered to me for a year was the acquisition of a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? Life is more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robis."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Delijs mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he died, and one of the last things he asked Delhi to do was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Deilius took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – entering the home in the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song – the "Proud" performed by Heather Small, which reasoned with him on his way to the achievements in the Olympic Games and always ate the Zosad.
The program "Desert Island Discs" will be heard on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m. after the British summer time.
Michaelson's out of shape on the reserve floor on Saturday's Raider's cup
American Son Mikelson (Phil Mickelson) will set up a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Rayder Cup game match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a successful turnaround.
Mikelson, who has already attended the two-year-old championship every 12 years, was seated on the reserve floor for four ball games and two pairs of games.
Instead of being in the centre of operation as often as it has been associated with the US teams, the fifth winner divided his day by acting both as a supporter and by participating in his game with the hope of correcting what he learns.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even on the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the hasty fight "Le Golf National" in an uneven field where miscarriage is regularly punished.
And if the game itself isn't scary enough for itself, on Sunday's ninth match, Mikelson will fight the exact British champion, Frenchco Molinari, who has joined forces with the new Tommy Fleetwood, to win all four matches this week.
If Americans left with four points, starting with 12 single-player cats, successfully run, the Mikelson match could play a decisive role.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate without saying anything.
"He fully understood his role today, spread me around my back, applied his hand to me and said that tomorrow would be ready," Furicks said.
"He's very confident about himself.
He is an excellent athlete who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I imagined him playing in two cats.
I imagined more, but it was as bad as it was, and that's what we're going to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will record Nik Faldo (Nick Faldo) for the most played matches in the Raider Cup fight on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Raider Cup's career, which has never really fallen with his individual record heights.
Mikelson has won 18 victories, has suffered 20 losses and seven undisclosed games, even though Furiks claimed that his presence gave the team a certain benefit of a non-material character.
"He's kind, sarcastic and smart, he likes to be concerned about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the latest players also liked to ring them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just games."
European elections Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major take-off can be quickly resolved
European elections Captain Tomas Bjorn knows from experience that a major take-off in the management of the fight for the Rider Cup in the last few days can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
In 1997 Danish debuted in Valderram, where the opponent's team, the captain of Sive Ballesteros (Sve Ballesteros), won five points over the Americans, but only now went on the finish line with a very small score, winning with 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You will continue to remind yourself that we were heavily guided by Valderram; we were guided by Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderram, where we won, but only with a small advantage," said Bjorns (in the picture), looking at the 2018 release group victory with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, leading with 10-6 golf courses in Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show to me and to every member of its team that nothing has ended.
Tomorrow you'll give up everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
This will not end until the points obtained on the screen are visible.
Our goal is to get this trophy and focus on it.
I have always said that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what the other side is against us – the world's greatest players."
As soon as Bjorn pointed out the performance of his golfers, he said, "I have never been happy about agru.
New challenges await tomorrow.
Individual games are scheduled tomorrow, and it is quite another thing.
It's great if in moments when everything goes well, you have a partner with you, but in individual games your golfer's skills are fully tested.
This message you must give to your players, that is, that they will give themselves all in the next day's game.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's team of opponents, Captain Jim Furicks will watch his players show their best performance in individual games rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spyt (Jordan Speeth) and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas), who won three points from four.
Fariks himself has been on both sides of these important last-day tournaments – both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later as a result of the European team's success in the sensational success, which is later known as the "Miracle at Medina" in the golf world.
"I remember every condemned word," he said, responding to how Ben Crenshaw, head of the 1999 team, joined his players in the last day's fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the quickest show you've ever had in Brooklyn, which you've had in Medina.
When such a impulse is broadcast in one direction, it creates great pressure for mid-term games.
We created our own composition and talked to the guys in a way that seemed right to us. We'll try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to drive the attack, and he entered the main game of Rory McIlroy and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram (Jon Rahm), Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter (Ian Poulter) in the first part.
"I arranged the guys in such a order, because I think it best fits during the tournament," Bjorn said about the selected players.
Rescheduled transfer of the new German flag to service
The German fleet's latest fleet was to be deployed in 2014, thus replacing the old Cold War War wars, but it will not happen at least until next year due to a faulty system and increased costs, the local media reported.
The transfer of the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" to the Baden-Virtemberg Freight Class is now suspended until the first half of 2019, it is reported in the Die Zeit newspaper, quoting the military area representative.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but the unpleasant after-supply problems had an impact on the fate of the vast project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wirtemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class fleets.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful range of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft missiles, as well as some hidden technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to place new freightes up to two years away from ports where they are registered.
However, the constant delay is that the latest technology wars that would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in the overseas countries will already be old by the time it comes into operation, notes "Die Zeit".
The F125 failed last year was considered in all the headings when the German fleet officially refused to transfer ships to the operation and sent them back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for this step, but the German media mentioned a number of significant "software and equipment defects", which would render warships invalid if it were used in the battle mission.
The lack of software was a particularly important factor as the vessels of the Baden-Virtemberg class were operating around 120 large marine crews, only half of the older Bremen crew.
It also showed that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the fleet to make its improvements in the future.
It is believed that the 7000 tonnes heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the wrong equipment, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) has also become a major problem.
It is said that its costs have reached EUR 3.1 billion in the original EUR 2.2 billion instead.
The problems associated with the new freight will become particularly important, given the recent warnings that the German maritime forces will be reduced.
At the beginning of this year Hans-Peter Bartel (Hans-Peter Bartel), the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet "starts to miss the ship to be used".
The official claimed that over time this problem has been significantly smeared, since old ships are being removed from operation but are not being delivered in place.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Virtemberg class freighters joined the Caraflot.
"National Trust" listens to the life of secret birds
The new study carried out in some property of the Scottish floor is aimed at discovering how the spiders use the screen in the food search process.
The findings are expected to introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to help them in future protection measures.
Scientists from Scotland's "National Trust" in Inverves gardens in Vesteros will study pulverized birds, pygmy birds as well as brown long-haired birds and waterless birds.
Special recorders will be placed in the main venues, which will monitor the bird’s activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound experts shall analyse all records to determine the frequency of the bellows and of the species carrying out the specific activities.
The biotopes map and the report will then be developed to create a detailed view of the scene reflecting the behaviour of the wings.
NTS Nature Protection Advisor Robs Dewar (Rob Dewar) hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important and how each species is used.
This information will help to determine the benefits of biotopes management such as the establishment of landfills and the best possible conservation of forests for herrings and other related species.
During the last century, the population of herbivorous birds in Scotland and the United Kingdom has been severely reduced.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works that affect the loss of the shelter and the habitat.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can shell paper and some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
Actually, the wings are not blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ear is more useful than eyes during hunting.
They use a complex method of determining the location of the support to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land maintenance throughout the country, is very serious about the problem of turtles.
The organisation has ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspection of slippers and sometimes even rescue work.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reservation for the specialty "Threave" in Scotland in Damfris and Galova, where eight of the ten species of falcons found in Scotland will be buried.
The property manager David Thompson (David Thompson) claims that this area is ideally suited to its wings.
"This is a great place for slippers," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and generally suitable biotopes.
But there are still a lot of things we don't know about the wings, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to better understand what they need for survival."
He emphasises that it is important to check that there are no sparrows in the place concerned, as it may happen that as a result of the unidentified destruction of one mother shelter, up to 400 mothers and their babies are killed, thus possibly destroying the entire local population.
They are protected animals, and they must not be killed, washed, disturbed or destroyed by their hideouts.
The Scottish Child Protection Fund (Bat Conservation Trust) has invited Elizabeth Ferela (Elisabeth Ferrell) to help the company.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about spiders, and for several species we just don't know how they look."
Ronaldo rejects the prosecution by ordering lawyers to appeal to the German Journal of the Court
Christian Ronald (Christian Ronaldo) has condemned the accusations he has made against them as "false news", claiming that people "want to pay attention" by using his name.
Her lawyers have been ordered to appeal to the German news journal "Der Spiegel", which published these claims.
The Portuguese origin and the Turina Juventus football star are accused of finding a number of American hotels in Kathryn Mayorg in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid the woman $375 000 to keep her quiet about the incident, so on Friday he announced "Der Spiegel".
A few hours after this statement, Ronalda, 33, with Instagram's online video, addressed her 142 million followers, calling this information "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the winner of the Ballon d'Or award in the camera.
"They want to become famous using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for my name, it's part of my work.
I am a happy person, and everything is good," added the player laughing.
According to the information provided by Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to appeal to the court’s journal “Der Spiegel” about the claims they have made regarding “unacceptable disclosure of suspicion in the area of privacy”.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage to an extent consistent with the severity of the infringement which may be one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel "Palms Hotel and Casino" class room "Suite" in Lasvegas.
According to the documents submitted in Klarka District Court of Nevada, Ronald and Majorga went back to the hotel number of the player, where he had found the woman.
Majorga claims that after that incident Ronaldi's critique was on his way and said that you were "by 99 percent "good boy", but the critique in this "one percent" coercion.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronald has confirmed that the couple had sex, but this happened after mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was taken to the hospital with photos of the injuries she suffered, but later she agreed to leave because she felt "fears of activism" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wants to accept the terms of this agreement, since that incident left a permanent trauma.
At the time of these claims, Ronald went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer for 100 million euros went to the Italian Grand Juventus.
Brexit: The United Kingdom's ever-feeling loss of autoproducers
"The United Kingdom "will regret it forever if, after Brexit, it loses its world leader's position in the production of cars," said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
Their concern is that Toyota UK has announced BBC, that if Britain withdraws from the EU without agreement, it will temporarily suspend production close to the existing factory in Burnston.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer said that delays at the borders in the case of Brexit could lead to jobs without agreement.
The Toyota factory, Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I think, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Toyota Managing Director of Burnston Marvin Cooke (Marvin Cooke).
Other UK automakers, including "Honda", "BMW" and "Jaguar Land Rover", have been reluctant to withdraw from the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit for a month, it will close its mini factory in Oxford.
As car manufacturers say, the main concerns are about the threatened supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
The Toyota production line operates according to the "lapse time" principle, where the cars manufactured at the order are available every 37 minutes from both the United Kingdom and EU suppliers.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement, there could be disturbances that could cause some delays and deficiencies.
According to Toyota, it would not be possible to hold more than one day's worth of inventory in its Därbishi factory, so production would have to be stopped.
Mr. Klarka said that the Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU, developed by Theresa Mejas (Theresa May), was "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that, as I would say, will not only benefit at the present time, but also use this opportunity," he said in Radio 4 "Today".
"The certificate not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, is that we must be able to fully continue the very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota’s failure to tell how long production could be stopped, but warned that long-term rising costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately endanger jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works in the factory as the Union's merger coordinator, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "I can say from experience that as soon as a job is lost, it will not return."
The government representative said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Tramp meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, report White House
Donald Trampa's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (Rod Rosenstein) can be "layed for another week", as the fight with the Supreme Court judge's candidate Bret Kaveno continues, as reported on Sunday by the White House.
Rozenstein monitors special advisor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who investigates the interference of Russia's will, the link between the funds used by Tramp and Russia, and the possible violation of the rule of law by the President.
For months, Washington has been considering whether Trump will abandon the Deputy Attorney-General and thus threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rozenstein had discussed entering the negotiations with Tramp and the possibility of leaving the President with Amendment 25.
Rosensteins has no such information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, where he spoke about his resignation.
Instead, it was announced a Thursday meeting with Tramp, which was then held at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Tramps said that "better" did not leave Rozenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a disagreement with the Senate's judicial committee, which showed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused him of committing a sexual offence — Dr. Kristine Blezia Forda.
On Friday, Trumps allowed the FIB to carry out a weekly investigation into the allegations raised by Kaveno, continuing to delay the Senate's vote.
Trampa Press Secretary Sarah Sanders visited Fox News Sunday.
According to Rozenstein's meeting, she said: "The date of the event is not yet fixed, it could be this week or a week, taking into account all the cases that are taking place around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see that, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters object to this claim: Sandersa has not acted on a White House press briefing since 10 September.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of letters was not related to the ill-fated "flavor spells" of television reporters, although she added: "The indisputable fact that they are spells of glory."
After that, she proposed direct contact between Trump, resulting in an increased interest in the press.
"The President took part in more questions and answers sessions than any president before her," she said and, without giving any details, said, "We are interested in their number."
Sandersa claimed that the alerts would always happen, but, "if the press will be able to ask the President of the United States questions at once, it is absolutely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot of this, and you see that we have done it in the last few weeks, and it will take place in a press briefing where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Tramps regularly answer questions by going out of the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences visited by important people.
Individual press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the President demonstrated his reasons this week in New York, focusing on the rapporteur's efforts not to be controlled and at times strange.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees of Scotland NHS about fears related to Breksit
The Minister of Health has appointed EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express gratitude and to delay the endurance of Brexit.
Gina Freeman (Jean Freeman) sent a letter to the MSP less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Fremena wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued during spring on the withdrawal which led to this autumn's decisions.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the involvement of each employee regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both the EU and outside provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care service and benefit our caring patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
After a head trauma to Kristen Abercrombie, emergency surgery is performed
In Tenesi State Protector Kristěn Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) was performed an emergency operation after a head trauma he won in Saturday's game, with the result of the 31-27 "Vanderbilt Commodores", reported sports reporter Mike Organ (Mike Organ).
The state team’s chief coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that they were traumatized not long before the half-life.
"He came to the side line and said it was ruined," said Rids.
While Abercrombius was on the side line, the coach and medical staff gave him oxygen, he put it on the bench and carried it to further investigation.
One of the state officials in Tennessee told Nashvila, the reporter of WSMV, Chris Harris, that Abercrombie was in operation at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that at the moment, "no information on the type/suspension of the trauma", and the state team in Tennessee is trying to figure out when the trauma was coming.
Abercrombie, a Red Crescent representative, is in his first season after Ilonise's replacement against the state team in Tennessee.
Before leaving the Saturday game, he had performed in general five blocks, which made up a total of 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher national fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
A higher national fee will be applied to foreign buyers when purchasing property in the United Kingdom and the additional funds obtained will be used to assist homeless people under the new Tory plan.
This step will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
An increased national tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The national cash register provides that up to 120 million bills can be collected per year to provide assistance to homeless people.
A higher national fee will be applied to foreign buyers by purchasing property in the United Kingdom and by sending the additional aid to homeless people, which will be announced today by Teresa Meja.
This step is considered to be an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to talk about the more sustainable part of society.
An increased national tax will be applied to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom in addition to the government's efforts to combat the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current national fee, including the application of a higher level of charge two years ago for the purchase and purchase of another place for rent, could be as much as three percent.
The national cash register provides that such a step may supplement its budget to up to 120 million dollars per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built property is purchased by non-residents, thus raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their home.
Many sustainable national territories, in particular in the capital, have become "pocus cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers, most of which spend their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson (Boris Johnson) asked to reduce the national tax so that more new people could be allowed to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing the land but not using it, and urged Ms Mejas to withdraw from the quotas for affordable dwellings in order to address the issue of British housing.
Mr Korbina has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including the reform of rent control and exit from the house without cause.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Ms. Mejas said: "I mentioned last year that I would use my Prime Minister's position to restore the British dream of a better quality of life for every new generation.
And that means organizing the housing market that we have.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and arrange their lives.
However, it is not right that homes can easily be bought as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom, so hard working people in the United Kingdom.
Many dreams about their home have become too far away, and the problem of homeless people in sound is still up to date."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to run Scotland."
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, claims that his greatest goal is at some point to become Scotland's leader.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which is now entering third place in the first league with three points from above.
This evening he went to the Stadium of Light after the St. Mirren was introduced back in Scotland's premier season.
"As a player I wanted to play my country.
I got a B cup, and that's all," said Ross to the Scottish "BBC" broadcast.
"But I grew up, along with my father looking at the Scottish games in Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, this option would only be shown if I were successful in running the club."
In charge of the "Sunderland" club, Rosa's predecessor is Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alardys, Martin O'Neils, Roy Keane, Guss Poyet and Paulo Di Kanio.
The former president of Alloa Athletic claims that he has not been disturbed by following so many well-known leaders of the club, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnslija and Ipsvičja.
"My achievements will now be assessed as to whether I will be able to return to this club in a premier manner.
Because of the structure and possibilities of this club, it certainly fits the premier," he said.
"The return of the club will not be an easy task, but I will probably think that I will be successful here only when this task is accomplished."
Ross is only in his third year in his career, working for some time as deputy director in Dumbarton and spending a 15-month period in the "Hearts" coach composition.
Then he helped the club Alloa get back from falling to third level and in the same season helped St Mirren to get a champion title.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable at the moment than in his career at the clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"These may have been real crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for Alloa."
"I really believed that management was my true call – much more appropriate than playing.
It was a shame, for I had made good progress, and I was able to live and enjoy some of the heights.
However, playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work - related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it. It seems that I'm in the right place, I don't feel so good all my life."
You can listen to the full "Sportsound" interview on Sunday 30 September from 12.00 to 13.00 after the British summer time.
The meeting concluded that the most appropriate time to enjoy the dishes was at 5.30 p.m. on the afternoon
The summer heat wave has left Britain’s less-popular circles to collapse, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data revealed that in July the sales of cows and sheep had increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Mārtins (Peter Martin), who represents the entrepreneurship consulting agency CGA, who collected the data, said: "Continual solar time and participation in the World Cup campaign in England meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e. the profit of the round had increased by 2.8 per cent, while the restaurant suffered a fall.
Restaurants with a fall of 1.8 percent in June experienced even more severe situations in July.
The situation in the cups and bars was the most grateful because they experienced a lot higher than the restaurants experienced downhill.
Food-based circles are also hard from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant workers felt it.
It seemed that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In cows and piglets, the market for beverages increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the market for food decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM Rest and Hospitality Analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of broad social or sports measures are the main factors determining the turnover outside the home market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups continue to fight, although the sales drop of 4.8 per cent compared to the period of the previous year will be particularly painful for the additional constant cost pressure.
With regard to food providers in the long and hot summer, it was not possible to arrive at the most inappropriate time, and the time will indicate whether the more moderate temperature normally experienced in August will provide the necessary space."
In July, the total increase in sales between ovens and restaurants, including in new companies, reached 2.7 per cent, reflecting a decrease in sales volume of brands.
"Coffer Peach Tracker" is a UK sales monitor for the bar, bar and restaurant sector and collects and analyzes the data of 47 operating groups where the total turnover exceeds 9 billion sterlings, and this is the industry's criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account it hides from their parents
The report reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
In the circuit where 20,000 high school students attended, the Instagram’s pages were exposed to false increases.
These reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
Each fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, forms social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In an area where 20,000 high school students participated, Instagram found that the number of false profiles was rapidly increasing.
These reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students mentioned that they have a "clear main" account to show their parents and also private accounts.
A mother in her 13 - year - old daughter’s hiding place discovered a teenager who encouraged others to find him.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Leaders (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and only half of them recognized that they kept private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's scary that so many teenagers form online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elida Doila will be a "soft voice" in the board of the Scottish People's Party
At the annual general meeting of the Management Board of Elidh Doyle, the Management Board of Scotland was elected as Director without the right to executive.
Doila is Scotland's most award-winning space and outdoor lighthouse, and President Ian Bytijs (Ian Beattie) described this step as a great opportunity for those who are driven by sports to use her vast experience at international level in the past ten years.
"The Eilida is committed to great respect throughout the whole of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world-wide lightweight community, and we are confident that the Scottish lightweight will gain an extraordinary amount, involving them in the government," Bithynia said.
Doila said: "I would like to act as a "soft voice" and hope that I can really get involved and help drive this sport into Scotland."

Instructions on breast milk pump advertising comparing mothers with cows
The breast milk pump production company has taken care of shared views online with regard to advertising where nursing mothers are compared to cattle feeding.
In order to mark the placing of the so-called "world's first silent breast pump" in circulation, consumer technology company "Elvie" launches a sticky prayer advertisement to demonstrate the freedom provided by the new pump to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers danced with a wall-filled cow at a song whose words are like, "Yes, I cry myself, but you don't see any eyes" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not the thorns, they're my breasts."
The landing continues: "Send out, send out, I feed the little ones, send out, send out, I kiss my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has called for a wide online resonance.
77,000 times and hundreds of times the video commented has received shared feedback from the viewers, and many claim that it highlights in the light of the milk industry the "threats".
"It is a very wrong decision to use cattle for the advertising of the product.
Just as we, as well as those to produce milk, have to become difficult and have to breastfeed, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they were born," one wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump is not included in breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk to mothers whose babies can keep?"
The view was also expressed: "Advertisers did not know what they were doing."
Others advocated advertising, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "exciting".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy it if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow when I was milking.
Advertising is a bit of a joke, but I understand its idea.
This is a general product," he wrote.
Another comment says: "It is a fun advertisement, thought for mothers, who shed milk (nearly in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "gooses".
It is not an advertising that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discovered that they all danced with unscathed pumps placed in their breasts.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who lose their milk claim that they feel like cattle.
However, the "Elvie Pump" pump is completely silent, it does not have a pipe and a pipe, and it does not necessarily belong to the breast of nursing women, allowing them to move freely, hold the babies and even participate in activities outside the home.
Anna Balarina (Anna Balarin) "Mother" partner and creative director, commented: "The Elvie Pump pump is such a revolutionary product that it has earned a brave and provocative marketing.
By drawing parallels between women who shed milk and cows, we wanted to pay attention to the removal of milk, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the depressing sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
It is not the first time that the "Elvie pump" pump has reached the center of attention.
In London’s Fashion Week, two children’s mothers appeared on the floor of Marta Jakubovski (Marta Jakubovski) when using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a large city at the Texas border
The number of children held by migrants has risen rapidly, although the borders of each month cross relatively many people, as before, and have partially achieved this in the rhetoric and policy of the Tramp administration, which has made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Usually most of the sponsors have also themselves been immigrants without documents, fearing that, openly, they will be in danger of leaving the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to allow fingerprints to be removed and this data would also be transferred to other immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz (Matthew Albence), senior law enforcement officer of immigration and customs laws, before the congress, showed that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for non-sponsored minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 percent of the persons arrested had not been previously punished.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or sponsors' households are staying illegally here, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
That is why we continue to pursue such persons," Mr Albensa said.
According to the asylum-seekers, officials have introduced new rules to ensure that some of them will have to be brought before the court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, as the previous standard provided for.
Many will take advantage of the call for videoconferencing rather than appear personally in order to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unfit for exemption will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are held in detention, the greater the possibility that they will become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or refugee attempts, has been reported in accordance with the information and evidence provided by asylum workers that has been obtained from the system over the last few months.
The lawyers claimed that these concerns will be reinforced in major objects, such as Tornillo, where signs of the child suffering are more often overlooked because of its width.
They added that moving children to a large city without spending enough time preparing them emotionally or allowing them to leave their friends could lead to traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces the US, France and Turkey "occupational armies" to carry out its military immediately
On the occasion of the visit to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valids al-Mouleems (Walid al-Mouleem) also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's ongoing war has been raging for the eighth year.
Moulems, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria in defence of the fight against terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualems argued that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people and millions of people have died since 2011, they have been forced to leave their homes, "the fight against terrorism has almost ended".
He announced that Damascus would continue to "fight the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleansed", purified from both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States of America has deployed approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and consulting the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al Asada.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
As for the refugee issue, Mualems announced that the conditions were great for them to return, and blamed "the individual Western countries" for the "distribution of irrational fears", which is why refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped to rebuild the country before agreement on the end of the war is reached between Asad and the opposition.
The United Nations diplomats explain that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish buffer zones based on the latest dumping in Idlib (Idlib) has created an opportunity to accelerate political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement prevented the large-scale attacks of the Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
However, Moualems stressed that the agreement "is a definite deadline", and hoped that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related group "Jhabat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura (Staffan de Mistura), hopes to convene the new committees, which will include government and opposition representatives, the first meetings to develop a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualems laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the work of the group would be limited to the "review of the existing Constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be delayed in 2020's election, unless, and possibly for that, many liberal observers, implicity and scandal will not put forward a point to his presidency.
And in that case, "it will be the most dramatic final of the presidency all the time!"
At present, there is no indication of the decomposition of observers.
Since 2014, the rating in the most favourable CNN radio time has more than doubled by reaching 1.05 million viewers, but the MSNBC has almost tripled by reaching 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News looks at 2.4 million viewers in the most favourable radio time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen informs the company, while MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reichelas Medovas show) is at the highest point in the cable TV rating with 3.5 million main news viewers in the evening.
"It is a fire that attracts many people, because it is an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neil Baer (Neal Baer), the support of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor". This drama is a story about the secretary of the cabinet of ministers, who becomes president after the attack is destroyed.
Nellai Skovelli (Nell Scovell), a comedy writer-veterranean and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys Club" is his theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that I would vote for Mr. Tramp.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he mocks me,' said the young lady of Skovel.
The chaos is to some extent entertaining.
Of course, unlike anything else seen on TV, the news from Washington could determine what will happen to the Rue against the Veido case, whether immigrant families can be united, and the global economic situation.
Ignoring is a horror that can only be allowed by the most privileged observers.
And yet this is more than to be informed to the citizen when at six o'clock watch expert groups discuss how Bob Woodward has used unidentified sources of information for his book Fair, Paul Manafort, $15,000 worth of bomber jackets from quick colors and skin ("the cloth from which the high-sounding mind," said Washington Post) and what role will Stormy Daniels (Stormy Daniels) play in the vicious description of the anatomical details.
I, for example, will never stop Super Mario again as before.
"Part of what he does, which creates the impression of reality show, is that he wrapped you with information every day," Brent Montgomery (Brent Montgomery), CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the producer of the Pawn Stars, explained about Tramp's variable team and daily turns (the celebration of the Kima Čenuna).
You can't let go of an episode for a long time, because otherwise you'll stay.
When I came to Mr. Fleiss (Fleiss), the time for the North Coast of Kauai was 80 degrees (~27 degrees Celsius), but he sat in rooms where, without leaving the eye, he looked at the MSNBC broadcast while writing CNN.
He was unable to find himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judicial Committee and his future in the Supreme Court threatened to be heard.
"I remember the time when we made all those crazy shows and when people said that "it's the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flies told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money flows from the outside into the pre-election campaigns of some of the most stimulant parliament's intermediate elections
It is no wonder that the 17th Congressional Election Area seeks money through the transformation of Congress areas, which will result in two existing Members fighting for one place.
This recently reformed Pittsburgh nominal area is linked to a Democratic Representative, Konor Lembu (Conor Lamb), who acquired his place in another region in the spring of last year's special election.
Lembs will fight with another existing member, the Republican of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th area of Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new 17th.
Following the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally distributed for the benefit of the Republics, the cards were recast.
The competition in the new 17th district has led to the fight between the party's main financial groups: the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when the 18th Congressional election in March was won by a small majority.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trumps won 20 points in this area.
Political experts provide for a small surplus for Democrats.
The United States considered the punishment of Salvador for supporting China, but then thought
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trampa had a friendly meeting in June 2017 with President Juan Carlos Varel (Juan Carlos Varela), and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partner stood behind the door of Trampa's management team.
The officials of the State Department decided to remove the diplomatic leaders of the United States missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of a "new decision no longer to recognise Taiwan", his department representative Hüter Nauerter (Heather Nauert) indicated in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were considered to apply only to Salvador, which received around 140 million dollars from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and the limitation of targeted visas, would be painful for the Central American country where the amount of unemployment and death has reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, with a focus on security and economic well-being, followed by a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an attempt to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, the country’s highest officials clearly said that they wanted the conference to be held, essentially by ending their comments on the punishment of Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pence has now decided to attend a conference scheduled in mid-October to show how serious the administration is stressing the meeting.
And three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic without any new and serious statements or sentences on the part of Washington.
The representative of the White House, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide further information on the debates that three American officials described, including two diplomats who agreed to consult in the internal negotiations if their anonymity would be preserved.
A close external analyst, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be maintained, confirmed their statements to the administration.
History study
In the second stone garden, there could be a special report by prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr. Trampa may have delayed justice, which has very much evidence in society.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the trampa campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If a second party wins the upper hand at the Congress, Trump will have to respond to this structure and possibly also to the jury of his fellow members at the moment he is about to meet with the voters again.
There is a lot of "but", and I do not believe that the collapse of the Trap is inevitable or that it will happen to its fellow citizens in Europe.
There are choices that will have to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to turn against Hitler, unless the West opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We are getting rid of and have long been able to avoid long - held blood transfusions.
History revolves around such turning points, and the endless march of democracy is speeded up or delayed.
Americans now have to deal with a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trampa resigns General Rod Rosenstein — a man who controls Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rozenstein has had a hard time since it was reported that last year he had a secret proposal to enter into negotiations with the President and thought about his inappropriate position.
Mr Rosenstein claims that the "The Times" story is not accurate.
"How do we answer if the FBI's inquiry into Breta Caveno is not complete or honest, or if he is confirmed to be a judge of the Supreme Court in spite of his unjust testimony and credible charges in sexual assault?
And what is the most important thing, will we vote for the mid-term election of Congress, which will be called the Trump for responsibility?
If we do not endure all these tests, democracy will take a long winter.
But I believe that everything will work out for us by referring to what we have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my missionary home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and for 60 years later sent me to burn the Sabbath candles on the table with a pillow.

"Rangers" star Grems Dorrans (Graham Dorrans) feels optimistic about fighting with Vienna's "Rapid"
"Rangers" will take over the "Rapid" of Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over Austrians after an impressive undisclosed game in Spain with "Villareal" will allow them to take a stable position earlier this month to qualify for the European League G Group.
The road trauma did not allow the centre's attacker Grem Dorans to re-enter the season's games until an undisclosed result with 2:2 with "Villareal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about this because "Villareal" is a good team," 31-year-old footballer said.
"We're going to play the game to be able to make good progress, and we're getting this point.
We may have been able to do so in the end, but generally there is no good result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we stayed in the second half and were better team.
And there will be another important night for Europe on Thursday.
Hopefully, we'll get three points, but it won't be easy because they got good results in the previous game, but I'm sure with the help of our supporters we can keep fighting and getting good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, it was obviously hard, but now there are new signs that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can continue the fight, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they are concerned about their pension charges
Although the respondents knew clearly what care they wanted to receive, there were few who had discussed the matter with family members.
Approximately half of the individuals in the national study indicated that they did not talk to their spouse about the long-term cost of care.
Only 10 percent replied that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want them to be cared for by family members, but they don't do anything to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Agency.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You can’t prepare your family for you will need care if you don’t know your wishes for a long time before.
Work with your consultant and family to talk about where and how to get care, because these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get involved in your financial consultant. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with the amount of money to cover these costs or insurance through your property, the main thing for you to have money.

He has also been accused of a Class B infringement, which may result in a day-long prison sentence and a 2000 US dollar fine.

Federal Prosecutors would like to request a rare death sentence for a person suspected of a terrorist act in New York City
Federal Prosecutors want to demand execution of the death penalty for Sayfullo Saifov, who is suspected of a terrorist act in New York City, when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed since 1953 for federal crimes.
According to one estimate, 30-year-old Saipov used the home depot rental cars to attack a motorcycle along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit the riders and bikers on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipovs killed eight victims "with intent" and "with intent" caused a serious injury, as mentioned in the notice of intent to request the death penalty lodged in the New York District Court.
In the case of both of these charges, it is possible to impose a death penalty according to the court's documents.
During the weeks following the attack, the Federal Supreme Court adopted a statement of the charge of calling Saipova into charge of 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the purpose of extermination normally used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of ill-treatment and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and a prior intention", the prosecutors explained that the attack by Saipova was "a shooting, inhuman and inhuman".
Saifullo Habibulajevičs Saipov (Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov) hurt, injured and caused damage to these people's families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nikolas Klivs (Nicholas Cleves), Anna-Lorija Decadta (Ann-Laure Decadt), Darens Dreits (Darren Drake), Ariels Eriks (Ariel Erlij), Ernan Feruči (Hernann Ferruchi), Ernan Diego Mendoza (Hernan Diego Mendoza) and Alejandro Damjans Pagnocco (Alejando Damian Pagnucco)," said in a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutors of the New York South District court have carried out a case in which the death penalty can be brought.
The accused Kalid Barns (Khalid Barnes) was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers, but in late 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
For the last time in New York’s federal case, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953 — a married couple who had been sentenced to death after being accused of participating in the publication of the Council for the sake of the Cold War of the Union two years ago.
The death penalty for Rozenberg was executed on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to the court documents, during days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not express regret over the attack.
According to the police, he informed the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipovs told officials that he was inspired to make an attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police also informed him that he had requested permission to place the ISIS flag in his Chamber.
He has rejected the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that he was "unsatisfied by nature" about the indictment decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand a death penalty is not to accept guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the resulting trauma to all parties involved," Patons explained.
The Saipova defence team has previously called on prosecutors not to request the award of the death penalty.
The Conservative Member declares that the management of Brexit negotiations must be in favour of NAIDJEL FARÁZ
During the protest, Naijgels Faražs promised to "mobilize the nation's army" at the conservative conference today.
Once the leader of the UK Independent Party announced that politicians should feel Eurosceptic anger when one of the members of the Teresa Mejas parliament suggested that negotiations with the EU should trust him.
The Conservative member Peter Bone informed the march in Birmingham that the Great Britain would have long been present if Mr. Farage was the minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge that will have to be faced by Mrs Mejas, in trying to reconcile her opposition party, was demonstrated by conservatives who supported the stay of the EU and joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his compromise plan on future relations between Britain and the European Union (Chequers compromise), and to experience attacks from those who want to leave the EU, those who want to stay the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The public said that she would be determined to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would leave the Eurosceptics and leiborists to choose between her offer and the chaos.
Mr. Bouna "Leave Means Leave" (Exposure) at the town of Solihalla (Solihull) announced that he wanted to throw out the girl's plan in the middle of the month (to chuck Chequers).
He suggested that he make Mr. Pharoah a friend and entrust him with a discussion with Brussels.
"If he had been on the phone, we would have already left," Bones said.
The Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw out the Mejas plan!"
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not move to serve!
We want to adopt our laws in our country!"
Mr. Bouna ignored the assumption that the public opinion could have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British has changed their mind and wants to remain in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit's supporter Andrea Jenkins also took part in the march, and the reporters said, "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular for our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and choose us.
Please answer Chequers and start listening."
With regard to Mea, she added: "The Prime Minister remains in place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians in my house should feel pressure if they are reluctant to disregard the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us – people – and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to transfer Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message, he fills the enthusiastic efforts of people: "I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to transfer Brexit, feel pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country, who have enabled us to win the fight for Brexit, and never relax until we achieve that we are independent, self-government and proud of the United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the rest of them traveled through Birmingham before a two - hour stay in the city center.
Unknown activists welcomed conservatives against Brexit banners after a group meeting this week.
The representative of the Workers' Party, Lord Adonis, has made a mockery of the Conservatives on the security issues they experienced at the beginning of the Party's application conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology to Canada and more, and yet, to the undivided border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.

The Baton Rouge Police, in Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspected person was arrested for a Friday shot LSU basketball player in the Type Sims case.
The Batonruž police station announced that at 11 a.m., Dayton Simpson, 20 years old, was detained.
On Friday, they broadcast a video of the doubt, calling for help in the identification of the man in the video.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches the world champion title after the team lets him sleep Sebastian Fetel
From the time that Walter Bots qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton became clear that the work of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competitions.
At first, Bots started well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place in the first two trips and calling on Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel's first came into the garage and left Hamilton's insanity to deal with the others, it was most likely decisive.
The Mercedes pilot filled the field later and retired from Fetel, but Hamilton continued to stand up to the leaders after the match of forces, who saw the Ferrari driver leave freely inside, risking leaving after a double manoeuvre in order to defend himself at the third point.
Max Verstapens started from the back row, and at the end of the first round was the seventh on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the race because he focused on tires to quickly reach the finish and slaughter Kimi Raikonen in the fourth.
Finally, he arrived in the garage at about 44 C.E., but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight circles, since Raikonens remained the fourth.
This is a difficult day because Valter did a fantastic job all week long and was a real gentleman.
The team has done an extremely important job to get one two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
The president, Donald Trumps, laughed at Senator Diāna Feinstein at the headquarters on Saturday about her refusal not to give up a letter from Christine Bleissian Forda, in which she accused the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking in a town in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the Forda's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "bad, bad and unreliable."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that's already happening in the last days in the Senate, when there's anger when you see angry, wicked, disobedient and incredible people," he said.
"When they read press releases and leaked information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document? "Yes, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do it...No, we didn't do it," he added, senators in ton.
In July, a letter was sent explaining in detail what Forda accused Caveno of, and in early September, the content of the letter was expressed, but Feinstein refused that it would have happened in her office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Forda's accusations, I'm "declaring" her story, "Finestein told the Commission," reports "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did it too."
But her refusal was not for the President who commented on this situation in his house last Saturday evening: 'I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language in the body I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, whose three women are accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own benefit.
"They are targeted to regain power through any means."
Whether you see evil, nonsense, they don't care what they feel they need to destroy to gain power and control," said the president, "mediaite".

The air traffic controller dies allowing hundreds of people on the aircraft to escape during the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he sacrificed himself so that a plane with hundreds of passengers would safely rise from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many have died after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulaves on Friday, causing tsunamis.
The territory continues to have strong post-harvests, and many are trapped in doubles in the city of Paul.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Ganavāns Agungs refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, which was heavily beaten.
He remained in his post to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, would be safely lifted.
Then he moved away from the traffic controller, thinking it could break down.
Later he died at the hospital.
The Indonesian air navigation representative, Johannes Sirats, said that his decision could be saved by hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC news.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to deliver it to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"We are heartbroken to hear it," he added.
However, the public authorities are concerned that the number of dead could reach thousands, the State Disaster Prevention Agency argues that access to Dongal, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is likely that the beauty will increase, as many people are still under the rubble, and many are also unable to access," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
The waves reaching six feet [6 m] high fell to Paul, where the massive bears would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, 35 years old new mother, Sky News said: "For a minute, the rapid medical assistance service introduces new victims.
Clear water is defective.
Small shops everywhere are refurbished."
Jans Gelfand, International Red Cross leader in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is hurrying to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can still make things worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia's President Yoko Widodo came to the military in Poland and the state said: "I ask you to work day and night to fulfill all the tasks relating to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
In this year, Indonesia was devastated by earthquakes in Lombo, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini says that one of the people has died after the plane crash in the camp
The airline took a flight during which the plane landed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people has died, although before it reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crashing aircraft.
Air Niugini announced the press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer for one of the passengers — the man.
The airline reported that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The locals helped rescue other passengers and services after the plane entered the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline reported that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
There are still unclear reasons for the accident and the sequence of events.
The airline and the US Navy report that the aircraft is entering the camp shortly after its departure from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the length of the flight was altered.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the crashing plane using emergency exits, since the water was only up to the fork.
He said that he panicked and complained, and that he had a slight headache.
U.S. Navy mariners working nearby to improve the ship’s landing also helped rescue operations by using an inflatable vessel to deliver people to the shore about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water before the plane crashed.
Data from the aviation security network show that 111 people have died in the last 20 years of the PNG registered airlines, none of them are related to Air Niugini.
Psychoanalysis commentator explains the night of events in which life was burned by a woman
On Saturday, the complaint provided evidence in the case in which the man was accused of burning the woman alive in 2014.
Commentary on psychoanalysis by the U.S. Department of Justice, Pols Rovlets demonstrated for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the dreamers how he used the information he had received from the phone to gather together how the 29 - year - old accused Quinton Tellis and 19 - year - old Jessica Chambers were doing the night she died.
Rovlets said he received location data from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, arguing his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers at the time when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford’s courtroom said that he was not in the city that day.
When the accused asked if Telly was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he "was lying because my car was in Nechville."
Another incident was that Telly said that the acquaintance of Chambers was only about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only know each other for weeks.
Rovlet said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis would delete the messages, calls and contact information from the Chambers.
"He'll take him out of his life," said Heil.
It is expected that the defences will provide their concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.

It's black again?
In New York, the couple complained about the dismissal after receiving "racist" news
The New York branch appealed to the court for discriminatory dismissal after she received the wrong message from the mother who complained that the branch "is still black."
Couples refuse to be racist by comparing the court case to "express".
Lindsia Plasko-Flacsman, a mother of two children, expressed her rejection of the fact that the new baby’s caregiver, Gizele Maurissa, was black on the day she got to work the first day of 2016.
"NON-CENTRALLY, REQUEST MELNAIS," Plasko-Flasman wrote to his husband in a short time.
However, she sent the message not to her husband, but to Maurice, twice as well.
In spite of his inaction, the Plasko-Flacsman dismissed Maurice, pointing out that his previous hunger, which was African-American, had done bad work and that she was waiting for the Filipinos to return to New York Post.
Maurice paid for her one day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice has appealed to the court for compensation and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for work with a secure residence, which he originally applied for, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," she said on Friday "Post," adding "I know it is discrimination."
Some reject the accusation that they are racist, claiming that the termination of Maurice’s employment was a reasonable decision, for they feared that they would not be able to trust her after the accusation.
"My wife sent to her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joels Plasko, husband, said "Post."
"But would you trust your children to whom you were treated like fools, even if it happened only because of error?
Your babysitter?
But think about it."
The court's sittings compared to "breathing", Plasko said that his wife had been born only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"Are you really looking at something like this?
It is not an acceptable action," the investment banker added.
As long as there is still a trial, public opinion quickly goes through social networks, rejecting them for their behaviour and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a talkative bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was confirmed, said in a letter: "It's hard to "put yourself in a basket", which reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very surprising now to know what we know about Padington's great achievements."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator of BBC before he felt the inspiration to write a book to children about a small toy, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweet-sweet-sweet" after his father’s departure in the last year.
Speaking of Padington, whom she calls a "very important family member", her father quietly boasted about his possible success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and not great," she said.
"But because Padington was so real to him, it was the same as if you had a child who achieves something: you were proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he saw the success of Padington in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the merit to Padington himself."
I had to leave my dying daughter by phone
After her arrival, her daughter was taken to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said it was very bad and expected that she would not live," said Ednana-Laperuza.
"Then I received a call from Ned, saying that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to leave her.
And so did I.
I said, "Well, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that doctors gave her to keep her heart working slowly ended and left her body.
She would have died even faster, and it's all over now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing it all happened.
I could not enjoy or cry because I was in a situation where there are families and people around me.
I needed a lot of power to control."
In the end, then the devastating loss of the daughter, Ednan-Laperuza landed on the plane with other passengers who had no feelings even for whom she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I pushed my head down and the tears flowed all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but right on the flight, I felt deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Pregnant women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicides
Two women, whose love has led people to commit suicide, act to help others not to take life away from themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfria strengthen the cards at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
David’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want a parent to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, a 45 - year - old in Lidney, said that her son had a promising dream with a dependent smile.
"Everyone recognized him after a laugh.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted" always and everywhere."
But he gave up his job before he died, because he was "very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences."
Davis created cards, "to make it known that there are people to whom you can turn around and talk, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit down quietly – you have to talk."
Hamfria, who has been a close friend of Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He did not say that he would feel sad or depressed or any other feeling," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or something like that."
Her death was a great trauma for children, but they had to end it: "It's a family-wide order.
That's what we're dealing with.
But we must all continue and fight."

Breta Caveno's future in the air because the FBI is launching an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he requires - in terms of time and volume - in a limited investigation - we could achieve a small consensus," Fleiks said Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the Commission was sharing a "participation" between a hard-hit entry.
Why do the supporters of Caveno and his Republics not want the FBI to carry out an investigation?
Their withdrawal is only a coincidence.
Interference is five weeks later, on November 6, if the Republics are expected to suffer, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect the highest court man from among them.
George V. Bush called the senators, lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked in the White House during Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 seats now belong to the Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, Vice-President, to vote and approve him in the Supreme Court.
Kima management "reduced" number of North Korean political asylum seekers
North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea have decreased since Kim Jongs came back to power for seven years, said South Korea's legislator.
Park Byeong-sew, quoting data from the Ministry of Association of South Korea, said that last year 1127 political asylum seekers were compared to 2011, when the number was 2706.
Park said that stronger border controls of North Korea and China and high human smuggling rates are the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most political asylum seekers from North Korea at the end of North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the severely protected Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China's political asylum seekers are considered illegal immigrants and are deported in a forced manner.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which remain in the technical war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denoclerisation negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Tramp and Kim Yongun in Singapore, when they agreed to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for no progress since these negotiations.
"If there is no confidence in the U.S., there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never be the first to unravel unilaterally," Ri said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nensia Pelosi calls Breta Caveno "historic" and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The Court's minority leader Nensija Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno "historic" and claimed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi gave comments during the interview on Saturday "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if the woman had acted like this, they would call him "historic," Pelosi said about his reaction to the testimony given to the Senate's judicial commission on Thursday.
Kaveno emotionally denied charges of sexual harassment to Dr. Kristina Blaisija Ford, both of whom were teenagers.
In his initial argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost shaking and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the democracies in the Commission, calling against their accusations of "the destruction of a virtuous and harmonious nature", organised by liberals who are angry that Hilaria Clinton lost his 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that the Caven's testimony was based on the fact that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he had a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think that he disqualifies himself with such claims and attitude to which he is addressing Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would try to question the Caveno if it was approved and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so - if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the existing court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno, at the moment, is a judge in the Court of Appeal of Washington County.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, he was disappointed by the possibility that Kaveno would take decisions against the "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Types because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation negotiations, Kaveno questioned whether he would reject the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It is not a good time to work in court with a historical and two-faced person, but we would expect us to say joyfully: 'Is that not wonderful?' said Pelosios.
But women have to keep their hands on them.
It is a denunciation, months and years all fell "by the side", but she is not allowed to take it all out of her face to cry.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinema told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She went on to say, "Sometimes a woman who was the head of a company who said she was crying when she was angry, but created a technique -- when she got angry and started crying, she told her person she was talking to, "You can think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I think it's great."
As a form of anger, the Azariahs are recognized only partially because they are understood on their own grounds.
One of my most vivid memories is from the oldest job of a man, when I was one time in tears because of the unrelenting anger of the elderly woman, the rebellious leader (the woman), who was always a little afraid of me, who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see that cry!" she told me.
"They don't know you've moved.
They think you're upset and they're just glad you got to "get under your skin."
Patrizia Šrēdere, then the U.S. Congressman from Colorado, worked with Geri Härt at his election as president of the campaign.
In 1987, when Hartt, who was involved in extramarital affairs, left the ship, also called "the making of fools" and left the elections, Šreeder, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for the President's office.
"It wasn't a carefully thought decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last they wanted to see again.
There were those who called it "Snow-white and seven shoes."
She was late in the campaign, her retirement fund meeting, and promised that she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was collected.
It was a battle lost.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, were only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting fired?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, broke into a system that made it very difficult to collect money and to talk to the voters instead of the delegates, and angry about sexism — where she was "nominated".
"You would think that I have a nervous breakdown," Šrēdere recalled how the press responded to him.
"You would think that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they're going to write on my hat.
"She cried."
Why the US-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The main accusations about how the trade war between the US and China started are hidden and while the fight is not seen to end, the disagreements between the countries can be favourable to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trumps issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation started this week with new rates affecting the unit's value of $200 billion (150 billion) and immediately leaving half of the goods exported from the USA from China.
Beijing is also responsible for "goods" every time, the latest is between $60 billion and $10 per cent for American goods.
China has announced that it is committed to responding to the US one by one and it is doubtful that the world's second largest economy could be reduced in the near future.
In order to withdraw from Washington, certain requirements should be met, but public clemency would be too embarrassing for China's President Xi Shi Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its card correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the economies of both countries.
"The fact that a political decision has been quickly taken in Washington or Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than previously recognized observers," said Abigail Greis, a New American Security researcher focusing on Asia.
Syria is ready to take back refugees, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and invites to help rebuild the country, which has been raging war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valids Almualems said conditions are improving in the country.
"Now the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the territories destroyed by terrorists in their normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country which they were forced to abandon due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
The UN assumes that the country has left 5.5 million Syrian since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still live in the country, and they need humanitarian aid.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept assistance in the reconstruction of the state.
But he stressed that the State would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped to promote peace.
European golf course sensational victory in the Raider Cup fight in Paris
The European golf course won the 2018 Raider Cup game, overcoming the US score of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six times in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe recovered the cup when the team led the sample to Thomas Bjorn acquired 14.5 points needed to cross the US sample.
The U.S. Star Sons Michaelson, who had a hard time going through the tournament, entered his T-shirt water at PAR 3 16th floor, joining the match French Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played in all its stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever won 5-0-0 results since 1979, when the tournament is played in the current format.
The American Jordan Spyts with 5 to 4 sensationally lost European teams, after rating the lowest player Torbjornam Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 Ian Polter from England, for which this was probably the last battle of Raider.
Eight Raider Casual Veteran, Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the best player from Europe all the time with 25.5 career points.
"Of course I don't regret it, but today I can't manage tears."
This was a tough year.
I am grateful from the heart to Thomas that he cured me and trusted me.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the cup.
This is the team's merit and I am happy to be able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European election victory.
He goes on to give his people John Rama, who won the U.S. Gulf legend Taiger Woods on Sunday with 2 to 1.
"The pride I felt when winning the Tiger Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said 23 years old Rams.
Vods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Raider case.
Statistics are not available to one of the best players all the time, who won the 14th-level golf tournaments, being the second behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the week fighting to find their advantages, with the exception of Patrick Ried, Justin Tomas and Tony Finau, who played the entire tournament of high-level golf.
U.S. election captain Jim Furick said after his team's unsatisfying performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will be restructured, I will work with the US PGA and the US Raider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to get your hats on.
We've won."
Latest information on the red landscape: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota (Sarasota)

According to the FWC, donations were reported in Pinel, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, which showed a decrease in concentration.
The red landscape blooms about 130 joules from the Northpinal to the southern coast of the area.
The plans are located about 10 miles from Hilsboro (Hillsborough) coastal areas, but in some places they last for about a week.
The red landscape will also be evaluated in the Pasko area.
In the last week, average concentrations were reported in the Pinela area or in its coastal zone, low to high concentrations in the coastal zone of Hilsboro, low to high concentrations in the Manat area, low to high concentrations in the Sarasota area or in its coastal area, low to medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, low to high concentrations in the Lee area or in its coastal area, and low concentrations in the Colje area.
In the areas of Pinela, Manat, Sarasota, Li and Kolje, the respiratory system is still reported.
Last week there was no reports of respiratory irritation in North-West Florida.
