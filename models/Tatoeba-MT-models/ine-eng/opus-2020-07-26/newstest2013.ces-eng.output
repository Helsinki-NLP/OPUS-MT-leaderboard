Re-election strategy of the Republican Party against Obama
The Republican leaders have justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud.
Brennan’s centre, however, marks such a fraud as myth that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after exposure to lightning.
In the last ten years, only 300 cases of election fraud have been reported by Republican lawyers in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections by individual states.
And in this spirit, most American governments since 2009 are declaring new laws that make the election process or entry to the electoral list difficult.
This event was followed by a series of elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 proposals for a law limiting the right to vote in 41 countries were submitted only in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit a proof of identity with photographs and documents on American citizens.
In addition, these laws restrict the period for elections in advance, deprive the right to register on the list of voters on the day of the election and deprive citizens of the right to vote in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state requested a photo identification certificate from the electorate.
The first state that introduced this requirement was Indiana.
The determination of the Indian law was confirmed in 2008 by the United States Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities have made rapid progress in extending this process to other countries.
In the last two years, the proposals for such laws have been supported in 34 states with the aim of forcing voters to submit identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people at an age who can vote, do not have a photo ID issued by the government of their state.
Furthermore, there is no such proof of identity of about five million new volunteers in 2012.
In addition, the installation of the required ID card is often worth more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions are disproportionately affected mainly by young people, minority members and low-income persons.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of volunteers aged 18 to 29 years therefore do not have the required identity proof of photography.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, know their attachment to democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their identity card in a number of countries with a photo shown by their school.
On the other hand, the same Member States shall allow members of the fishing or fishing clubs who elect more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in elections.
By 2004, no State had requested a citizenship document in its elections.
The first such requirement was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have adopted legislation which imposes the obligation of volunteers to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It should also be noted that two out of three Hispanics give priority to the democratic side.
In 2011, the Republican legislators supported eight states of the law that violates the voter's record on the day of the elections.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to volunteers who want to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigns to register voters have helped about 10 million people.
The measures taken after 2009 but led to a decrease in the recording of new votes in 2010 by 17% against 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws aimed at shortening the pre-election period in five other countries.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of African-American voters were elected in advance, although only 13% of African-American voters in that country were elected.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made only 11% of all wishes, but 24% of the citizens voting in front.
On the other hand, whites who represented 76% of all volunteers made only 46% of the volunteers who elected in advance.
Of course, against the adoption of laws restricting the registration of volunteers, democratic legislators and their supporters were very important.
The democratic governors have blocked a number of bill proposals by their own.
In order to delay the validity of the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
The damage was partly limited.
For example, only 16 of 34 States have adopted the law requiring the submission of a photo identification certificate.
However, the newly introduced rules make the exercise of voting rights particularly difficult in 2012.
The democratic criticisms speak primarily of the assumption of the approved laws and consider them a clear effort to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
Brennan's 2011 report shows that the States where these laws were approved represent 171 of 270 votes in the voter's assembly necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
However, one thing is certain already today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: graduate examination or not?
The PSA test resulted in a slight error of negative or even negative results, leading to unnecessary medical progress.
All of this has increased the weight of men who have been so reluctant to go to the exams.
To let yourself be investigated or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a high level of contamination between individual test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients undergoing the investigation and those who did not.
This study also proved at a 12-year interval that those who fail to investigate have a higher risk of metastasis of 30 to 40%.
I therefore recommend a 50-year-old examination or 40-year-old if your direct relative has prostate cancer.
The most dangerous group are also men of African American origin.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are ineffective.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to the patient the level of risk of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer that does not affect life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, a number of men with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
Let us suggest that they be more active in the field of active surveillance and offer them treatment in case of disease progress.
More and more often, we define the criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment and which one does not.
However, I recommend that the examination be completed.
However, it is important to complete the interview with your doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an investigation.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that enables evaluation for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, the best way to reduce the risk of disease is to adopt the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all were healthy and moving enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this data would amount to at least 50%," urged André Beaulieu, a Canadian cancer research spokesman.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers cause hereditary disease.
Some percentage remains unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, although the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes are 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's an unscrupulous human health.
"There's still 1.5 million chickens in Quebec today," twisted the speaker André Beaulieu.
Exciting data: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of death to half cancer is reduced.
Weight
Body and obstetrics are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat intestines and endometrial, cornea, plums, and hives.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against the cancer of fat intestines throughout life," the report adds.
Surviving
That organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid the distinction for which the same applies.
Preservation of meat by smelling, drying or salting may lead to the production of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
In recent times, different scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet come to a clear conclusion.
Studies based on vitamin E are fragmented according to the SCC.
Although one of them says that the risk of prostate cancer is reduced, another study says more about its increase.
Nor has the effect of vitamin D on cancer been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu continues to see how important it is to talk about his fears and his family's past with his doctor.
"Reducing the investigation doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs' boon examined
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs Bosnu caused a legitimate blow in the summer.
There is a view that this boron is divided into a mechanism that is responsible for all mass in the universe.
And then it's the last part, whose existence predicts the standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the mass - which has not yet been empirically observed.
But among physics, there's still no sign of any confidence that Higgs's boron.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new component, which is very similar to the Higgs Bosne, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the large physical congress in Kyoto are more corroborated, but all the data are missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it's Higg's bobon, because the risk of failure appears to be small, and let's look at what it's actually going to be.
In this world, there is a completely unquestionable law that cannot exist at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard on it, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it shows that similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantal state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or farmers, who observe Paul’s principle.
And on the other hand, the boons are moving, according to anarchists who don't really respect anything - certainly not this principle, which means they can be at the same place at the same time.
These boons are further divided into two groups according to the device (but absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley's laboratories: the messes, which we leave here without any notice, and the "force particles", which spread great natural forces and with which Higgs boons are probably somehow associated.
It must be said, however, that these boons are not as exotic as they might be thought.
If you read this article, it's thanks to a box with unusual banality: photon, or "parts of light", which is "the owner" of electromagnetic forces.
If the particles with the electrical charge accelerate or change their direction, they will "break up" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like the shell thrown into a fisher.
From this "removal" the electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photomechanical wave - and thus one of the borons, "power bearers".
More stable fields
It's also with Higg's boons, but with the difference that "to cancel" is another field, Higg's field to show up.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; its excitement must be achieved by achieving very high energy values, as in frozen fish levels, which are already very high.
For this reason, it is necessary to use as large accelerometer of the part as accelerator in the laboratory CERN - a large hadron accelerator with cutting joints is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
Analogues with the electromagnetic field are again appropriate to explain the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
The electromagnetic field does not respond to all the particles or all the materials.
Some, for example, magnets do so, but others do not - piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to a refrigerator.
And it's also true that with Higgs field they don't react to all the particles: those who do so have a certain amount, while the others (such as photos, let's look at them) don't have it.
And Mrs. Novakov asks what all these research is for, what will they bring us?
From the point of view of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any mismatch between observation and predictiveness of the SM.
In addition, the lack of physics literally wants to be able to find it, because the smaller difference could open the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model has so far a huge deficit, does not provide any explanation of gravity (oha!) or dark matter, which is about 80% of the universe's mass (beyond ooh!).
However, CERN has not shown such a dispute until now.
Responses
The answers to these studies in your daily life can only be very difficult, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be no one.
See: At the very beginning of the 1960s, laser propellers in Bell's labs had no idea of the revolution that their work was calling for.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (formerly paprish were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said that - the laser was originally considered such a "laboratory player".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application may result from all the tools involved in research.
For example, Willard Boyle created a small light camera in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This video player, even though Boyle didn't plan it at first, now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around LHC have to change our lives, but it means that man never really knows...
Paliative Care - The best way to get out of life...
By means of its Commission for Dignity, Quebec has recently taken part in the educational issue of the end of life.
The debate should continue soon and the bill will be in motion at the same time.
There is still much work to be done in this key area.
Le Devoir’s magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
The cancer of the prostate that fed her gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's seven," she says without emotion in her bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he says.
Immorality has done its work: Immoderate weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
He looks at the deliciously looking breakfast and agrees that we can help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop at him, bring him drugs, offer a bath.
He's brave of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of this intermission, it humiliates me," she confesses.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his medication problem.
"In all life, a person learns that men are wetting clothes," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"Depends on the ability of the person to accept the return, the psychologist claims.
In the opinion of a number of people who deal with palliative care, the essential moments are played in the very core of such a return.
Patients who go home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care suffer from all cancer.
Their prognosis is maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them do not provide so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it's the worst fear of dying "to breathe in full consciousness".
But she made it possible for me to reveal her children.
"I have good kids," he says.
"I no longer have any wishes in my life," she says, and then lets us put on her breathing device.
Yet he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois's home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, he provides body care with food.
That's what palliative care looks like, if you can't do anything else.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one bed of palliative care is available for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little if we realize that we're all going to die once.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, the taste of brandy or pepsi can be provided.
Diabetics don't have to watch sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night they brought Mr. X.'s beer, which he died later in the night.
This morning, he'll drink his son's beer to the honor of his late father.
"We're helping patients just as close to them," says Nathalie Savard, director of the care service.
Victor-Gadbois's house goes on a day after day, but they don't like each other.
In addition to a 30-year-old, who rejoices in the last meeting with his family, who is thoroughly exposed to pillows, while being impressed by his honor, a tragic 16-year-old man dies surrounded by his parents, his wife, and two little children after he has tried all the options to survive.
"For half a year, there are always three to five beds, which are designed for people with cancer for 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martelová with concerns.
53% of patients coming to Victor-Gadbois' house, coming here from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, which is intended to alleviate the suffering when the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organisations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montreal Home Paliative Treatment Society, specialize more specifically in the care provided to oncology patients.
And this fundamental lack of medical care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors who specialize in palliative care are concerned with the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, it has been in the course of manifestly signed by palliative treatment units such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they have demonstrated their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec medical system is not effective enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before it is possible to agree with the implementation of euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in emergency pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
It is feared that patients should not be asked to die for the reason that they are not cared for.
And at the same time, it is true that a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last moments, regardless of the adverse forecast.
The hopes for the survival of Hélène Richards were already very minimal when she left for advanced chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was out of treatment, she said she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And then she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who want to die thank their treating doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when their palliative monkeys eased their pain.
It must be said, however, that palliative care is certainly not all - powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the director of Paliative Care in the Grand Montreal Home Paliative Care Community, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which will make the patient succeed until the end of the day, either permanently or permanently.
We cannot face the fact that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
The patient we're not going to get sick will have an ever-increasing chance of accessing palliative sedatives.
The powerless without sedatives always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But it doesn't always have to mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this report made it possible for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive reality scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political lobbyists and Italian mafia experts are still telling us what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, state officials, politicians, experts and mafia are involved.
This "field" has come to Quebec taxpayers very expensive, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has collapsed since we took the basic measures," said ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebecan MP and former police chief in Montreal.
As a result, in 2011 he launched a scandal on the basis of a thorough investigation based on the disclosure of funds in connection with the construction contracts in Quebec, which then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved until after long delays.
Duchesneau's report confirmed a direct link between industry, transparent financing of the parties and corruption of state officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport has managed to make billions of dollars contracts," when some people kept their instincts in check to get a share on them!
Charbonneau's commission "which led to the demise of two elders," he adds with the hope that she will be able to "discover the zeal of some people".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The permanent unit for the fight against corruption established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
To this end, police officers "Marteau's families", who have been ensuring since 2009 that the watchbook "money-in-the-counter" significantly reduces the inflaming of orders...
In recent weeks a number of visits have been conducted and have complained about the fraud and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one of the localities.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just retired from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
It is suspected that he has repeatedly accepted payments in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurus and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito called for a sensation when the Commission explained the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
During these years, he dedicated himself to 3% of the value of the contracts he obtained in Montreal, a medium connected to the Mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was nominated.
After 2000, Zambito was generous on all sides and dedicated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, particularly to liberals who were then in power.
He also acknowledged that he had organized an illegal screening of funds for former liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with financial institutions whose prices have exceeded
In Montreal, there was a "system" of corruption very chili.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it very carefully before the commission: during ten years he received a gift from construction companies, a call for excursions, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a total of $736 000 in exchange for a price-enhanced contract.
The other public operators in the transport sector have admitted that they have let themselves be paid for by 30% to 40% overestimating invoices by means of false multiplications.
The mayor's organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of turning his eyes on the contemporary budget without a break, which brought dirty money into his treasure.
Based on these findings, Tremblay withdrew at the beginning of November, throwing Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first members of the theatre to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010, he has been working against the sale of the general land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the midst of the exciting real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "it aims to catch the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the promoted antagonist system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits".
According to her, the process is "sick, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up a separate investigation unit in Montreal and ensure supervision so that these questionable practices cannot be returned.
It's like she's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public actors have cut off hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "informed agents", unless they get involved in these trades!
It estimates that 70% of the funding of election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and with irony it adds: "I hear it's just a bad turnout of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to restrict gifts to the parties for $100, but according to it, the situation does not resolve: "Unless electoral spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We can't reduce it anymore; if we focus seriously on the substance of things, we can rebuild on a stronger basis and with greater control and enforcement of laws."
If this story made a picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that anyone who mocks him to look at his own castle...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and the PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by all individuals going to themselves, or by a completely new size of PSG.
The big players came to us.
Every day I get beside them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these realities make it possible for me to increase the level of games.
And it's easier in the fights.
It's all going so fast in football.
But I'm not losing my mind.
From my beginnings in the preparation at INF Clairefontaine until after my transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always considered myself a single degree.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Anceloti introduced...
Posts from this year are common to play matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me then has a greater taste for racing and wants to give maximum performance.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
My hand has assistants like Claude Makele who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all techniques.
Today he is not equal in the 1st league and belongs to the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience and he's got a lot of titles with the team's tips.
He worked with excellent players, too.
I think he wins another title in Paris.
In January, I graduated from a calming conversation with him.
I had a lot of injuries behind me.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st class, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still in the lock.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we have made it very easy to go to the eighth level.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for the quality of the European team.
We want to win our qualifying team first in front of Port, so we can play at the eight-miffinal game at home.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
The budget's got to do with...
To become a major European club in Paris, it has to win titles and sign up in history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this objective.
And would it be a great failure to win in the 1st league as in the last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win a league title.
We've been missing enough in the last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually it's true that with 79 points you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had even more amazing season.
I think this is gonna happen this year.
Even though the title is being used by large teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the PSG media is expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect from us a lot because of what we've invested in here and how we have players.
We're just taking it.
It's true that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something going on in our newspapers, it's not exactly nice.
A man asks what more people might want from you.
Of course he can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In Lisa Masters, we proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn't been going to the Osmiffinal since the second season, and they have also invested large amounts!
In view of the amounts invested, it would be expected that you will have 15 points ahead!
You insult the other clubs and the French league.
The clubs Lyon and Marseille, which did not happen too much last season, moved to another stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that in spite of all the difficulties we have been able to overcome.
It seems like the PSG in everything depends on the performance of the Zlatan Ibrahimovice.
It's a good thing it's said there's "dependence on the Gold."
This means that Ibrahim is very effective and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's a 1st League star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect people and players.
And he respects the people he has around him.
What he's achieved is truly exceptional.
This has led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also makes it possible to grow alongside others.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with French representation?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I saw it, and I got out stronger.
Today, I'm going to be able to play a good match in the performance.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I started to represent.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps in the head of the national team?
He's talking about the results.
We're in a good place at MS.
The coach picks tight, is close to the players and can breathe for victory.
That's how Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is the remix (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This fight has given us self-awareness.
We were all fighting for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't win that kind of game for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and cost of processing between recipients.
As is often the case with these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the current financial system based on banking monopolies leads to a financial crisis.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but convertible to dollars, euro...), as well as a secure translation protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites are already receiving bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to 2 dollars, today moving at the border of about ten dollars (the course is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on the virtual finances that came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "competition dollar and euro" and "the period of normal money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being used as "credit" for the procedure in the video game that a person wins or can buy (and then swap back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Every month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all networks are the depositaries of the books of ordinary accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose another address for any payment that provides anonymity.
The information file relating to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thereby verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is further possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of regular accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is included in the entry of this new transaction into this book.
It is carried out by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers whose solver, such as a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this supplementary order.
This is a phase of file cutting; that is to convert a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then the whole "cut off".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then be irrefutablely displayed linked to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would be made to change the print.
If the user wants to pay the same money twice very quickly for the purpose of fraud (up to ten minutes), the network confirms only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, these remunerations are regularly divided into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but it can be divided up to the stomilion, so the space for the margin is here...
The difficulty of the task is also increased by an increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services have been attacked and the protected bitcoins have been removed.
"The shell used does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of clearing dirty money by virtue of this anonymous service.
But this problem pays for cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like a WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of Weizman's Constitution in Israel recently analyzed the book of regular accounts and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not going on.
In November, the "great discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," he congratulates Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a bitcoin converting to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or a wireless payment mobile, but uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper because of it.
In addition, the carrier manages its identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily configured for traders where you do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just tell the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, explains Pierre Noizat, which ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin happens, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," she predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB expects to reassess the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French units left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Capisa and Suroba).
NATO and US units should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of their territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The greatest harm was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside, whom we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, are about 88 soldiers killed, and what are all those injuries and freezes?
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leading representatives who fled to Pakistan, but often are rurals who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they were added to them by the jihadites, the Pakistanites, the Arabs, the Uzbek, the Tadjik.
They now enjoy tolerance and often help local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decrease.
The departure of the French units from the base of Nijrab, which I was following from the peaks of the mountains planted by the Mandlons through the French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
The convoys of trucks and parked vehicles arrived in Kabul without an attack on the airship of the helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will not be so active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed significantly from their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996.
The Kabul was once empty, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of battles between different combat groups.
Their takeover of control over the country was then considered to be a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these peasants, who were completely controlled by Al-Ká'ida, but their situation has not improved in our time.
Some mujahedinas, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main values of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became captains, strengthened state lands sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American orders for subcontractors.
They were discredited; most of them were neither at all in the battle.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people are looking for a government that won't make thieves.
A number of young people want to leave like those who have been able to use American generosity: the loss of capital is significant.
The young man is tired of war and of ideologies associated with it.
During exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they met the modern world and its advantages impressed them.
About 65% of the population is 25 years of age; in Kabul there are currently 5 million inhabitants, five of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people will have to provide work, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former, or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in her forehead be considered legitimate?
Some commanders of the battle against the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias that will be out of control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a country with a strong local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation according to the model of Western states, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so that the Prime Minister's position, which existed since the Constitution was adopted in 1964, had been abolished.
President Karzaí does not want foreign controls, especially in the case of elections scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has been able to recover, no alterations are working, no basic wetting system is fixed.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, but fruit and vegetables.
Advantage has a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
It was reported that Afghanistan has enormous ungrowth wealth.
And it just felt like the Western states were here just to strengthen it.
Without energy to process iron or copper on the spot and without means to transport raw materials across the mountains, no effort can be made to grow.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the goal of the Mes Aynak Castle and left the international archaeological teams (in support of the World Bank) to explore the extended Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, it will also be necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on a large proportion of imports and exports.
The departure of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of common forms of assistance: girls and boys lycea, French universities, French institutions, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "to acquire the heart and soul" has served to reconcile aid and military activities, in which the "cimic-military steps" Ministry of Defence (Chemic) has been abolished in 2012, but has been achieved thanks to a number of French non-governmental organisations in the area of common interest and agricultural reconstruction in ten mountain villages.
These activities involving the number of local workers have helped to resolve the rise: wetting, cold, drinking water, deforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of processing areas.
What kind of memory do we have after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often over 2,000 m above sea level.
The municipality received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapis.
In order to free these farmers from the rise of foreign-led groups, they wish, according to their words, to achieve undue civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Hard Work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursí left for the next part of the poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the declaration of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited power, it decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all the others, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
A few weeks ago, the head of the state of this assembly was assigned another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using the provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal arguments.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's dissatisfaction.
From the point of view of the opposition, the President breaks down in his "autocrat delirium", continues "to violate his word" and "toss the right".
However, its ranks ensure that it is a means of preventing as quickly as possible from the constitutional and political crisis and speeding up the transition process.
In two weeks, a referendum should be held.
It is a very brief passage of time that makes the Brotherhood withdraw from the Egyptians’ intention to explain the article after the article.
For the President, it is also about how to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while protests are being rejected throughout the country.
As Muhammad Murssi confirmed in his interview for the American Week Time, it seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this fast-organised vote is put by the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "You either approve my text or I leave unlimited authority," which otherwise should end after the new constitution has been approved.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 Members of the said constitutional assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most Liberals were missing in the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was declared, they knocked at the door by not having an opportunity to express their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have taken their steps.
In order to achieve a capacity for reconciliation, 11 of the alternates were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
Then it will not be surprising that the articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further argued that one of the many disputes that day was about... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the sitting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, is finally in line with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hope that it replaces the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would make it possible to apply more stringently.
For the Islamic people, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of the Egyptian society.
"Traffickness," they say to liberals who see only a verbal problem.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar with the advisory role, in particular on matters of monitoring compliance with the law of the Sharia.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "persons who are invited to express are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy."
The concerns of the Liberals are even more exhilarating to the fact that the next principal of the university should be less calmed than the current one.
"For the time being, there has been no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not inflamed, but university workers, a number of them studied in French schools," Alexis Blouet, who prepares work on constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be disagreements as to the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used therein are part of a religious dictionary.
There is a particular reference here to "fiqh" [Islamic Law, No. Reg.].
And in the future, there may be a question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to express themselves."
Yesterday, the text approved is highly criticised in addition to the religious pages for the extended powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood insists that there was a significant restriction against the former regime.
Another controversial place: the authority of the armed forces.
In accordance with the wishes of the military representatives, it will not be a verification of the defence budget to be carried out by parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
They will then not be prohibited in military courts from dealing with civilians as required by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
These associations speak of their doubts in relation to the text which they consider to be anti-freedom.
The criminal offence is maintained and the offense is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for printing.
In addition, no article is taken over by a protected woman, highlights Heb Morayef from the Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36 is the only point of view.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to be on TV last night, events are scheduled for this afternoon.
The state's leaders will manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the world's beaks and the sea from a saturated solution of salt
The country promised in itself combines the size of Bible truth, modern comfort, and the insecurity of nature.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Give With Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will come upon all who enter into this “wicked one. ”
And Galilee is the place of Jesus' miracles: changing the water into wine at the wedding, walking by water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here go through the Way of Pain or the Way of Jesus Christ (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the cross, to the stone of the anointed and to the place where Jesus was buried.
There is a symbolic Christian dove of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree from which the cross was made to Jesus ’ cross was built.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - a wall of ruins, the rest of the temple that was destroyed in Rome in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, here people of different denominations leave notes with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Entrepreneurs by Vertical
The fact of Masada’s fortress remained hidden from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The cliff is located on the slopes in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who deal with horocescism can gain access to it by their own powers.
The others on this historic mountain will take out the chain.
And in the north of the country there is a well-known Hermon ski resort, which enjoys a huge tourist resort in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists travel from the foothills of the square bus.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, they were likely living on the top of the mountains of the proud gods.
Visit the unique museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit all of them during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish wilderness, and further some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Arts is also worth a visit to Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition, his wages are widely represented impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha museum, which presents to visitors several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with the figures of users of spas and spas from that time.
In Caesarea, you can visit a unique private museum of Ralli where you can admire the soybeans of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides and no paratroopers.
The entrance is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the museum of the burnt or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - will tell about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memory - was built on the memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter inside - and you will notice in absolute darkness.
The stars are shaking.
And the names of the Jews' children and the names of the lands in which they were slain shall be changed.
Ukraine is also being introduced.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa centers of Israel are divided on the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphins and oceans.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it is also possible to buy in the winter months because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it has people bathing all year round.
The Dead Sea is, by the way, the most unique sea in the world, located at the lowest anchor point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Azur water is a saturated salt solution that easily maintains on the surface and on persons who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealisticly beautiful.
Get out here to undergo treatment with salt water - saline, and a medical bath that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the faeces, diabetes, to treat your sore nerves.
Touch the Secret of the Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
They were accompanied by famous voyages of the sea, including Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The records of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and preserved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived together a long and happy life.
In fact, tourists love tolls with trails named after the zoo.
It's said that if you press on the walls in the street of "your" sign, happiness will be a favor to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can go through the Roman theater and "get" the strength of the crusades.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the home of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontus.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, by word of mouth
If you are going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your incomplete English: in this country about 30% of the Russian population.
On the road it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for cheques (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
The city transport is mainly bus, but in Jerusalem a speed tram is driving and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper.
It's basically a underground wireway.
Traveling by all types of city public transport is worth 6 cheques, for which you can drive 1.5 hours with a transfer.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Shabat is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, it stops working on markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts a week's work.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: except for pork, seafood, fish without mushrooms and food containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a wide selection of meats from lamb and bovine meat, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cheese hummus, the most diverse kinds of sauces, cakes from milk of foreign - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no fat dogs on the streets of Israel.
That's why there's a lot of hungry cats here who are gracefully "toying according to their taste."
In the evening hours you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Passing cats love fertilized places and taste it for every good.
The car rental will be from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day, depending on the vehicle brand.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And to borrow a bike will be about 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museum are on average 30 shekels.
Indicated numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to know the country.
The country's promised visit from January to October 2012 to 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the expiry of the visa on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: migrants will save their money in the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, there have already been frauds in the country who sell "failed" certificates
Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities come to 13 million foreign workers every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the Act entered into force, under which each migrant worker will be required to pass an examination of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail.
However, FMS promises that the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors over time.
However, the tests will be based not only on language knowledge but also on Russian history and the fundamentals of law.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Tomuto law is not subject to any people who have successfully managed to obtain a certificate and obtain an academic degree in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The use, judgment and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the protection of Puškinova Institute of Russian Language, University of Friendship among Nations, Moscow State University, State University in St. Petrohradá and other Russian schools.
Migrants can test all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia today.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by representatives of the State pride and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have been able to put a lot of questions in the press: and what does it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russia and for visitors themselves?
In particular, the migration service representatives are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering as a result of "foreign work."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the FMS Russian Presidency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
Their rights should be protected before they leave.
Only an organised recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise in immigrants without a call, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev - the future migrant is sentenced to shoots with dishonest people, who will help him to provide him with a "sign" to a horrible, close settlement in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will spend months without food and documents and run for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their authorities they promise one thing, but after arrival they are deceived, they entertain their passports, they don't pay the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Tajik Labour Migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't pretend!
The less many Central Asian citizens who intend to move to Russia, they recognise that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not have experience even with the work they do.
Of course, it is not their fault as much as the accident: only very few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tadzik can afford at least adequate basic education.
For their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed properly, dressed, and dressed for school.
As children grow up to productive age, they have to get to work on the first occasion.
Without language knowledge, it's hard to admit.
"You feel humiliation and undermining."
It is true that in view of the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
The test will only be carried out for those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't test it or get any more official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live as well as previously in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or unauthorized entry"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy at all.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization is also worth money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police employees know that we basically have false documents, without registration, and that's why we're running a leak.
"Requires a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he shared his experience with the public of Tajikistan, Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be hungry, buy a painting"
On the first day of validity of the language law, it was found that false documents were not only evidence of migrants' registration.
FMS employees have already had a number of false certificates on language examinations.
The forged documents are printed on the ordinary color printer.
Of course, new owners did not get free: each of the migrants hoped that it would be so easy to solve the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two-and-a-half times the amount of the formal test: it will become migrant workers of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to ensure a system against corruption so that workers can not simply buy documents, which is agreed by government officials and human rights defenders.
Government authorities may so far promise foreign workers who have not managed the tests for the first time, the time required to complete the course of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not have Russians are expected to work in areas where there is no need for active contact with people.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not run an illegal arms market
The proportion of criminal offences involving the use of legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia submits a proposal to strengthen the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the response of government authorities to recent events: there was an incentive to shoot cases at weddings that were hanging without a victim, and a massacre prepared by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, who killed seven people as a result.
Police want to prohibit the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This opinion supports the head of the Committee of Pride for Security and the Fight against Corruption of Irina Jarovaj, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be submitted to the State House in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to solve the problem of the path of "screwing".
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social firearms organisations - demand the rejection of the "unreasonable repression" law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, Vasili Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminal spokesperson with the Russian version of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed within six months of 2012 using gun-guns registered in the Ministry of the Interior, while 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not accept the defendants to move to the "black" market.
According to their words, a low-priced voluntary weapon is currently available in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from competitions by officers
The "Black" arms market is stocked with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages receiving arms orders
The first of them is the "military or military journey", which means a weapon that was cut off during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by the Russian officers and the captors themselves," Baranec says.
Other types of "black weapons" are weapons stolen criminals from security forces.
Baranec explains that there are also thefts from police stocks and weapons stolen directly from employees of criminal authorities.
Illegal "mainly" are obtained for sale from military stocks.
Many military stocks often cause explosions.
"It has been shown that some fires have been deliberately founded - to cover up the lack," said the former soldier.
According to the words of Barance and the arms manufacturers, they make their contribution.
"There are currently private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market, and they are cutting off weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is feeding.
In particular, a large number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and there's a mafia that organized their gas production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Designing Public Administration.
Specialists have broken down the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office's records, criminal literature and public data portals focused on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "in the wine of official agents whose work is linked to weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases occurred in the theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% being "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms trades that he asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations of black "archeology" are not purchased long ago - they are just too old.
Most often, as he says, salesmen drive for new shipments directly into military stores.
Through the wiring, the interested person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
You're going to order a gun with him, and he's going to sell it to you across the board.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for 900 euros per piece with two containers," he says.
"The truth is that the police are good in the image, and therefore whenever they start to burn a plan in the explanation of criminal acts, they will carry out a check-up with illegal arms dealers," the advisor adds.
"Like in a luxury store."
The sellers with the buyer most often find each other across their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Testing" platform where there would be a man who would lead me to the "cat" where we would act together.
The price was mostly found out there.
Military reporter Viktor Baranéc
If I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, tells the salesman, the advisor.- I have such a guy, but I don't fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there's also to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovice, who asked me to arrange that the daughter fell out of the tooth."
And now I'm going to get over the man I'm sure of.
He's also giving it to me because he knows I'm not giving it to him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid - 1990 ’ s when he was working on a building for publication on this subject.
The schematics didn't change according to his word.
They gave him a photo album where there was "everything you thought."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranèce, doesn't offer chits in the bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we're going with a salesman in the woods and we're going to set up a counter.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is shooting well, we're starting to act," says the expert.
Inflator on the sofa
Searchers will bring you to the "Vkontakt" website and groups where you can buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising title on the website "Buy a gun or a machine."
On these pages, users leave their notification and ask questions.
And sell the unfavourable?
"Of course without a license," asked the user "Ivan" (record is retained).
"I'm buying TT.Moskva" - it briefly formulates the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently decided on a huge network of targeted websites and people who want to buy military weapons can bury them with a shovel.
People gather like hungry fish for bait and then get coal on Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military chaplain Viktor Baranéc
I have heard about such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer will make the payment through the ATM.
"In response to this, the salesman sends a photograph and a description of the instructions where the gun is hidden," Dmitrij Kislov, a press spokesman, reports the NGO "Right to Arms".
Viktor Baranec confirms that after ordering on the websites, you can stay free of weapons and feel at home.

"People gather like hungry fish for bait and then get coal on Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When you buy illegal weapons, you will usually pay from $100 to $900 according to expert estimates.
According to Dmitrija Kislova, from the NGO "Right to Arms", you will arrange Makarov's gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon shall be dispatched from the stockpiles for long-term storage through the stockpiles of the medium-term article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% in October 2011 compared with the period of January 2011 and decreased by 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of reported cases of theft and extort of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, staff from fast food and supermarkets
Work on carefully operated "McDonald" passes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days in America, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the high-markets of Walmart and in restaurants of popular fast-growing chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Vendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will be turned into a wave of nine, or whether it will be judged soon.
All these actions are supported by committees and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in the low wage paid by a number of employees in Walmart and in rapid exploitation systems, the aim of protest organisers is to achieve their creation in their committee organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically unaffected by the expertise.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday", when she hit a cheap sale orgy in America, captured millions of residents, and in some cases she was accompanied by fighters.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, in which 2.2 million people around the world are working, have left their jobs and demonstrated together with the committees and left-wing activists of international traders whose goods are destined for lower and middle-class people.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from prey through hunting rifles and car batteries to dryers, eggs and milk.
Products in its sales are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees with low wages in Walmart's stores only buy themselves at work.
Availability and range of goods made from the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow itself to sell goods so cheaply because it only pays little of its employees.
They also complain about bad working conditions, such as lack of automatic vehicles or hand scanners.
The "Black Friday" demonstrators demanded an increase in wages and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the companies increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but it doesn't match the cost levels, the employees say.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it will be $3.2 billion a year.
It's an average of 1.1% more than this company is paying now.
If Walmart moves an increase in the wages fully to the consumer's shoulders, each visit to the sale will be only 46 cents more.
In a year like this, customers will lose about $12,39 more than they do today.
Walmart’s supporters point out that the protest was carried out only in nine countries and that the company should not cause virtually any harm.
"Black Friday" in the company's sales lasted from 8 hours on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
In total, her deposits were made on "Black Friday" of nearly 100 million transactions.
Dan Fogelman's representative stated in the interview for the left-wing Huffington Post website that the jobs left "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was all "more media sensation" organized by the committees.
"Unencumbered treasure!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's business houses (the ones in that advanced city are not too in shape, and therefore are not nearly here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of dollars and then doesn't pay you sick and does not pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, City Council member in New York
At the present time, the minimum wage is paid for work in accordance with the federal laws and the state regulations of New York $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wages, but only slightly, and on average, they receive their number of workers in New York at $8.90 an hour.
There's no lower wages in this precious city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
The "McDonald" employs nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the school desk for partial consideration and live with their parents.
Only a few people are watching their main source of life or planning to stay there for a long time.
At present, I keep meeting with McDonald's employees, who complain that they have to live with this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and at Madison Avenue, demanded that treasurers and cooks start to receive at least 15 dollars per hour, which is more than double their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of a committee organisation in the area of rapid exploitation.
American laws prohibit the administration from defending the establishment of trade union organisations and from punishing the activists of trade union movement by blackmailing and release.
On the other hand, management is often easier to manage.
However, it is difficult to establish in the fast-growing industries of the Committee's organisation for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Incompatibility
This day there were loud protests in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The performance of this event was at the "McDonald" Sunday meeting near Times Square, where a number of local democratic policies took place, especially a member of the city council Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then doesn't pay you sick and does not pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also welcomed the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as the old town candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to go out together to support fast food workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, which every non-virgin deserves!"
As the New York Times said, it was the greatest act of its kind in the history of the American sphere of rapid fertilization.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even though not all of them were employees of the fast-paced occupation, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event becomes a spark that burns the flame of mass movement is still unclear.
"I'm afraid the brain can be fooled by the average."
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is the popular theme of expanded reality; lately it means taking the world especially across the borders of special glasses.
At the beginning of the year’s annual conference, Google introduced a working model of this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft also applied for a patent.
From the interview with the leading group of interactive 3D technologies in Microsoft Sharam Izadim’s Cambridge laboratory, it turns out that for scientists of this company, glasses are already in the past.
The perspective of virtual objects manipulation in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public displays.
- Please tell us in the frame, what's your research group doing?
We're dealing with man's machine interactions, but at the same time, we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, mankind has stuck in the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect recorders - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is for sale without Kinect recorders today, because for everyone it is very interesting to manage using gestures.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Although the Kinect system has transmitted the interaction to the physical level, a lot of interaction is still taking place on flat screens, sometimes in 3D.
The input stream has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output stream is not particularly so yet.
We're trying to change this, we're really working on three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
We need to get the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much better form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimating?
- Of course he cannot be considered an exaggeration - a matter of privacy arises because we do not always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not about various, just such clusters, short ones.
The gesture would not be taken as a camera of the device, but as a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far he's big, but theoretically he can be reduced to the size of the bracelet watches.
However, it is generally true that the future has a mixed type of control, such as the gesture + voice.
- How's that?
For example, how do you ask me to give you this lemonade bottle?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the user to adjust to what the machine can or can't do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work first and foremost on developing new types of recorders that will be able to more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a relatively good deep resolution, which is very important.
- Do you want to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough divorce, depth, or anything else today?
- It's basically a current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on a three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about megapixels alone, it's like a mother and a deep one.
At the current point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So we need to remember not only the difference between X and Y, but also Z.
So it's also very important to speed, number of images per second.
The human movement is relatively dynamic and the current data flows 30 images per second are frankly little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch-on sensor with adjustable delay of processing from 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not every man understands how it affects the human interaction with the machine.
For me at work, there would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, but I don't need so much touch, but I need some images in a second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three "camera", one of which is actually the infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera, it's actually a visual tape recorder.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible kinect analogue system, play with curved camera position and see how it helps to determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) didn't present his glasses in public.
You don't think that with regard to the daily use of technology extended reality using special glasses, it's one of the most powerful platforms?
- Of course to walk and constantly hold the smatphone in your raised hand is not very comfortable, but I think the most powerful option would be a "bearable" image of the expansion of reality when it would be possible to switch on the platform of the clouds whenever from the glasses to the smartphone, the projection display and further around.
Bryl - it's a very personal device, it's their strength (only you see things), and at the same time the weakness - extended reality based on the bryl will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
How does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the extended reality - it's the seventh in the gap between man and machine.
I think the addition of mass intakes could be a eight-way break.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is being used - using the other hand as a certain kind of background for the display.
It's an excellent way to record pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding mass to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of several directional ultrasonic peppers in the defined point where the finger is located, triggers a sense of mass, but it's still very weak - as if you were shooting at the tip of your fingers.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects nerve marriage in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To think he's feeling what he's supposed to feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to accept a person who is physically located in a very narrow space to believe that he is walking with an open, practically endless space - we also work on the concept of running lanes (not like clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain failure becomes a goal, it's still work for many years.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - a lot of things are at the very beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradská avantgarda", dedicated to citizens who are in charge, are an avantgarda of culture and art.
At the top of the list, there were already significant figures of Petrohrad’s construction scenes, whose profits exceed the city’s framework, often find recognition in Europe without reaching full recognition.
The new hero "Rosbalt" is the amazing writer Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - the man of the house, who is all dressed in red, which you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Gardens, here in fashion halls and on the paints.
The pictures of Cyril Miller, where they are exposed, always attract the gifts of the spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petroradic manufacturers, the creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is an imaginary man of a petro-garde avant-garde at the end of 80 and early 90s.
In addition to being a city man, his rage on the streets causes a smile on the faces of the citizens, it increases the mood.
He recently took the bottle into his hand and became a petro-rad bottler, because he grew up in this complex role with his entire God-made life, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking all over the city in red and not in yellow or, for example, in Turkish?
- I've chosen a red color as a designer with an eye and an image.
In this world, the red color compromise between artist, imagemaker and the public is a compromise.
Although it is generally true that everything that is a little different from gray is aggressive and promotes bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on making a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevska, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my way is.
At that time, I could not understand the waves of old free informal artists and the new, free types of artists.
I was friends with the artists of the new wave, the post-gazonese who brought us to Puškinské 10 and the other waves were not.
I like the theatre, the clothes, the music, all the genres except for the words.
- And all this has happened in your art clinic...- It was important for me to feel at the center of the culture of Petěrburk, where all the best forces of creation should be gathered.
In 1995, I held a place on Puškinské 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, a house of peterburkka bohema.
There were many born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Schnura brought up with the project "Ucho Van Gogha".
Schnur and his friends sang under a shimmering song, dressed in prolific tricots, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many hali-galitime programs.
We gave them Trachtínberg, thereby starting his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboidov - that's the call of Art Clinic.
This is where our workers left and our guests are staying.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In 2000 the research was organized in the press, the special price was "People in Our City".
In the nomination "The Artist of the Year" I was appointed, thus ending my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In recent years it is easy to be popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my images - these are hits in which the current and the periphery are captured alive.
I'm going to have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clunes".
Clowns are an overtime category.
I used to be social, being like that is painful and scary today.
But in clowns, it's all going crazy, it's going to be a tragedy.
I love grotesque, my grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by means of total redundancy in the order of order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him your hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the tax will be removed by a change of clothes.
- We recently saw you as a city bottler. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should it be if it wasn't me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a cultural breakdown.
People used to meet in noises, God loved one, just other people.
Today it's all broken up into a micro-community, it's very hard to like everyone today.
I'm not a stodolar banker to like everyone.
Today we need to think about who you like.
Today every cultural hero has 100 fans.
And there's a few thousand spectators coming to St. Michael's.
- The fans will come to him. There's a sexual social environment.
And there will be 300 people on the cultural land and 10,000 will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything is sacred.
I've got fans, the main thing is that nobody's gonna mess them up and break what they're used to.
When I was young, I painted images that were hanging on a wall with Falke and Larionov.
I started with images that most people end up with.
Today, we're going to get people to get to know each other a lot.
They say:Culture spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's poison.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who rejected money for painting images.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an artist through culture.
Not every one of them can do culture.
At the time of the proper emperors, it was not so in all, the emperors may not have understood much of the culture, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in Petrograd who might be experts, but they're confused somewhere in the corner, because they need great experts who really appreciate these experts and they're going to put them on the right track.
It's a taste that thrives today.
Tataj Erarta, but it's different from saying that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should be looking for another museum.
- What do you think of Peterburk?
- Petěrburk - it's not the main city of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And on our horizon, art is being made miserable.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers today than readers, that's bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to shows, concerts.
We just have a level of weakness.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was in the early century.
The project is implemented through St.Peterburk grant
Rotated Into Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collage with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with land on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: How to keep your family in conditions of freedom or on a particular replacement planet.
I don't think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a highly established scientist at the State Astronomical Institute P. K. Sternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
Living there is only possible at high altitude or orbit of Venus... in the universe.
To answer the questions of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were made on plants.
Four generations of toys grown on a circular track are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
Then it was performed to extract the tissue into orbit - very small fruity men of Drosophila.
In 1979 it was sent to the universe to verify how the embryo develops in a state of no difficulty.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird on the exit.
But then problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find resistance, it has to build on its own feet and start moving," says the leading laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find resistance, the birds are chaoticly falling and making coarse flour.
After 10 hours, freshly depleted birds came to a complete decline in instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was they just died in four days.
" Twice we let the birds fly, but then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them there," comments the failure of the chicken experiment in the Vladimir Sychev universe.
The last "miniarcha" flew on a round track 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but only the beings of one sex will be.
He's been experimenting with rats that were being sent to space already pregnant.
They basically didn't reveal anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the earth, the descendants of the cosmic rats were born.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instincts when losing their normal environment.
A man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens governs abstract thinking and is able to create the right emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the threat of the Tereskov.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Tajka flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if they'd take flight to space.
If he can give birth after that year.
"Because no one has answered this question yet," says the Veteran rocket-space industry of the Watchtower.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to space, Valentina Těreškov's first wife-cosmonaut was born.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrian Nikolai.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut of Svetlana Savický was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
But the risk remains.
We only have a few cosmonauts that have been born after years and are growing the health of the offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital years," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hrdin of the Soviet Union and Hrdin Ruska Valerij Poljakov.
However, mankind must inevitably look for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydro-laboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, under the conditions of zero attraction, cosmonauts conquer the habits needed to work in the open space.
Water imitates the state of ease.
Perhaps for adults, water is comfortable, but in its strange way, for young children it is natural.
Little yachters seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between having a child on average 9 months in the mother’s fruit water and then making it easier for them to get on the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the time of birth, from the time of the first burial, only 2 weeks will come.
"It's very little for the child to forget something," says the Newborn swim instructor Marina Axenov.
In effect - if for a newborn, the condition is more natural, then for women is more natural inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In the state of undiminishedness, it occurs very quickly to shrink the belly muscles, the muscles of the pancreas, decreases the body’s ability to produce fruit.
We can leave this aside if the stimulators of muscle activity function at birth.
After all, it is possible for the baby to be born in a special chamber in which the mother’s body will hatch the fruit.
"And what else?" asks Valerij Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not attracted to the earth, it cannot properly shape the body or the muscle system.
Newborns on the circuit are not possible to dress as adults in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He's just gonna get rid of what he needs for his development.
"If we go with you into an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a healthly injured person to Earth who will be totally unfit for this environment," the Head of the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov Bioethics Commission predicts.
So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
However, the time will come when the earth will become a reality and when the earth will be released into its crusts on a distant planet, which will become the home of their offspring born in the universe.
Head of NKU: Control of the fraud system has failed to blame politicians
In relation to public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation, but does so in its application.
In the interview for Current.cz, the vice president of Miloslav Kala's Supreme Control Office says that.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what we think is missing," comments Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example, the wrong practice indicates Peter’s approach to the so-called “swarc system”.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the business with its controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be somewhat set up, and if it prohibits something, then neither the president of the government shall be able to prevent the work of the authority which is obliged to go to check and enforce obligations," Kala notes.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Embassy, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, under which legislation on public procurement was compared.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that European legislation regulates the way in which public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislation and then by the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the control has not yet been completed, we have shown very interesting differences - generally referred to as legislation is also possible with us "more thorough and perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to continue to create more precise rules, but it is necessary to apply the law itself.
What can this project really do for you, what's it gonna do for you?
That is exactly what joint control could help to stop us from making efforts to simplify laws, reduce and improve limits, if it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal proceedings.
But by reducing the limit of orders, we don't have to achieve it.
Maybe the system pays a lot of "paper" that those who want to find holes in this system will be much easier off than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about foreign problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the German control system work?
Is the office here similar to our NKU, or is it set up otherwise?
As for the offices, as the NKU works there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised like us, also has a college, it is just a little different, but in principle both offices are acting in a similar way.
The powers are also similar to those of a certain degree, namely, that Germany has gender arrangements, so that it also has these accounting courts at the level of individual countries - in which the system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only control the cash pool, represented by state resources.
The public media, which are managed by our countries and by the localities, are controlled from the level of the public courts.
What about the more so legislation, so that's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany has been designated as an example, but it cannot be said that it is better at all.
So it's also the fact that they have better controllers?
No, I'm not, but I'm saying again, I don't like this comparison.
But it has to be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model are dealing with a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a good thing for them to work with our office, would it?
What about foreign legislation, which meant new laws on public contracts for your office, is its impact?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it has not yet appeared in control actions.
Because we're doing ex-post checks, we need to count with a certain delay.
We are observing this so far only in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new "risk detection" tool, through which we have found almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - these changes will obviously occur there, because the limits, the conditions of some types of selection are adjusted and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be a benefit rather than another burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can arise here is that she's a "screaming" rule, and it won't be possible to keep it.
For the purposes of the previous rules, controlled persons are already bound by the supplier (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means a breach of the budget.
So does the law have the price to be reduced in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who allow formal doubt that does not affect decision-making.
Such a system will create only greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of this?
Let's show ourselves where the road doesn't lead.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the business with the control of the so-called "sparing system" - and what does that mean?
Is the switch system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits anything, neither the President of the Government shall be able to prevent the Agency from carrying out its duties and responsibilities.
He can say, "Let's change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're going to do it like nothing.
The law on public contracts contains relatively strict rules as to what should be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the best bidder is excluded only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think we miss.
The roads are points of velvet, most of them but of velvet
In several places the Czech Republic has smooth roads and also snowcapped.
Most of the time, though, cars are mobile, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovarský kraj
In the country of Karlovar this morning, the road was snowy, but it was snowy and snowy.
The temperature decreased between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be slightly heated.
Snowing in the region has risen and lows have only a weak level.
But on the hills of the Crusades there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
The sites were even less visible because of the noise, resulting from the dispatch data of the country's road drivers.
The R6 motorways and first class communication are now in the region without restrictions.
Caution, however, is at the site, for example, at some crossings where the surface may be smooth and smooth.
Passengers are also all roads of the second and third classes including mountain roads.
In some sense, however, the remains of the frozen and the place of the harvested snow are still on them.
Especially in higher positions, increased attention should be given to driving.
Pardubic and King's Landing
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic, there is a threat of freezing, in higher places and on the mountains it can be caught on the communication level of snow, informs on its pages the Directorate of Roads and Roads.
Motorists are protecting drivers from freezing, it can be formed especially in higher positions in the Pardubic region.
The fence can be around Lanškrona, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or High Myth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemicals are treated on roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
The snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlic Mountains.
The covered snow level is at the highest level on the roads in the periods of Richnov nad Kniežnoj and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic it is most often clear today that there is no strike.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Plzeńský kraj
The roads in the Plzeńsk region are mobile this morning, but there is a need to adjust the weather with increased caution and driving.
It's cold after the wound, temperatures move between three and nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communication may be brittle.
The seats must also be counted with silence, but visibility will gradually improve.
It comes from the dispatch of national road drivers.
The D5 distance is almost unlimited, but increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzeńsk and Tachovska, however, there may be rough cuts.
Communication of the second and third classes are wet and in this case there is also a notice on the wet sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent routes in the forest area.
Olomoucian Country
With the snowbag on the road they must today count drivers heading to the highest points of the Olomoeck region.
After a chemical examination, she remained on the Red Mountain seat and on the road towards the Videlian Cross.
On the night of the snow, the motorists in the field, on Schumpersk, according to the road managers, snowed about three centimeters.
In the other parts of the country, the carriages are mostly free of restrictions.
"Shumpersk is in the highest position of the remains of snow.
With the snowbag on the Črvenohorska saddle, the drivers must count towards Jeseník," CTK today said the driver of the Sumperian road management.
In the evening, their colleagues were also on Jesenicka, the roads to and from the highest places are now, according to them, after chemical treatment, bare and wet.
On Olomouck there are roads that travel unrestricted, but on Sternbersk drivers should pay attention in the forest sections where the vehicles remained wet.
Austic Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult travel sites are reported today after the crash of the road driver in northern Czech Republic.
In addition to several areas with snow or ice cream, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecka is also closed from the police database.
Temperatures are also kept below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially in the south-east of the Czech Central, there are no problems, and roads are usually dry.
Transport complications have not yet been reported.
The appearance of the glaciers is reported by road drivers, especially in the area of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions for it were ideal in the night - over the day raining and snooping, in the night clear and cold.
From the main lines, adverse conditions are reported also on road I/13 on the edge of the Östek and Libereck region.
The branch from Telnica to Knínica opened its tree branches, which, under the snow's cover, turned to the driver.
Šimon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in a month?
It's just one of the other scary news that people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it rather and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to keep us away from the end of the world or prevent it from happening.
In December, you will also organize a completely united project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you imagine him closer to the readers?
It's a state-wide benefit action we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
On 20 December, from 21 hours ago, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end will be near the time when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in Tichomore, which is in the time zone 12 hours before us.
Who came with this idea?
It was probably my idea at first, and then we all thought about it together with our author, Honzo August.
In addition to the fact that we want to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about how we can once deliver this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we also created unique collections of items of shoes, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support by buying at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap Group along with other interpreters also sang a so-called Hymna against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
She's already very popular on YouTube today, and she's also gonna sound at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, and that's in full conclusion, if we can do everything and the end of the world doesn't happen...
All the performers sing it at all three concerts at the same time.
Hymnas also come together in a unique direct broadcast on Czech television.
He wrote words to this song and the main role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomás Hanák, also singing Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other Czech cultural personalities, given that we organize a lot of beneficial events and concerts...
We're trying hard to get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in and involved in working with us.
What's the race from the concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the Barrier Education Centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the Civil Society Tap in the Jedlikk Institute.
For students of Jedlik's institution, teachers regularly attend and devote themselves to activities that are fun and interesting.
The students themselves do not have the means to give themselves up as lecturers, so we try to enable them in this way.
Within the framework of the provision of the Jedlik Institute in the future, there will be a separate building to move to.
There will be several music groups and interpreters at each concert.
What did you pick them for?
We've been trying to set up a program that will address all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barto, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Dryý will show.
For more information, please contact www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombistic actions" and to the future?
In May, we will be the first to go to the Prague Spring, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we'd also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we're in the United States, I'd like to connect it with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist; you have already been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow for example.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these routes logistically and organizationally?
It's not as scary as it looks at first sight.
We have five members on the electric vehicle, its vehicles have to travel in the luggage area, and of course we're carrying a large amount of cargo and no equipment...
However, until now it has always worked out without any problems, ČSA and British Airways have been very prepared for us, that I've been amazed how many times.
Even in Moscow, which we came back from recently, it was without any problems.
You can compare how each individual differs in bariency, public access to handicrafts, and so on.
What have you met before?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we were witnessing in Russia that everything is still in full swings in the east.
On the contrary, Prague is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on the electric vehicle to move himself in the center of the city.
It doesn't even pay for the kind of self-evidentness you need to give the riders the advantage in the elevator.
Fortunately, civil society is already developing, trying to alert people to problems with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, do we still have to reach a more prosperous country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
It is important, however, to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's quite common that even people with heavy handshake move to the public on their own, can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not too common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on the contrary we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or the integrity of the public is one thing, but only when we are important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things start to change really.
So far, it's the only cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap chapel is currently very popular, but let's go back in a few years what made you start it in 1998?
I acted as an educator in Jedlik's constitution, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing saxophone, so I started an interesting music circle with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our moderator Ládź Angelovic says, we're a little out of hand (Laughter).
But the popularity has come up in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we began to associate with well - known singers and also to work actively on the promotion of the band.
It turns out that work that is not visible is basically as if it did not exist.
Moreover, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to attract it with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something else.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one resembles the other.
It's logical in its own way, everything new is taken care of, and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I'm sure I can say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us first is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with a handicap are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
They are people who can live a meaningful life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with a handkerchief, it's not just a move for them, it's for the whole company.
Has this success also helped you to be a strict boss, how many people have labeled you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require certain discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic show and a head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the test twice a week, go to the product and spend a lot of time on the concert trails, the excitement is quick to leave.
But that's how it works everywhere in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, it can't be prevented.
Who wants and likes, always has the door open to us
The day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
Running in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Flédí and Ostravo Plynojem with 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities join the telemost in the evening when singing the song of the chapel The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funding for the provision of the STUDEO multifunctional wireless education centre at the Prague Yedliksk Institute of 25 million CZK
Access to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age have free admission tickets to the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Poland to the cosmos.
Last week, Poland was adopted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, as a second country from the former Eastern bloc (Czech Republic, which became the full-fledged member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the next years.
However, the Polish road to the cosmos began a long time ago.
For years the Polish people had been devoted to space before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will remind you, for example, of a lecture by A. Sternfeld in Warsaw's astronomical observatory, which presented ideas from his progressive work on entering the cosmonautique on December 6, 1933.
The thoughts of a young engineer (1905) left the listeners cold and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for the entrance to the cosmonautique in France.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautique.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous propagandist of cosmonautique and his benefit was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named by his name.
In 1925 a railway dreed was built in Poland, which was to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and does not know the details of the project.
It is not clear whether the rocket should be used for or for braking the drain.
Information about this garden is known only from time to time.
Since 1933, the Polish metropolis has been under attack by rockets.
The research provided the Nuclear Engineering Cell in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslawe Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
Of the materials stored, it is evident that the research has grown into the stage of practical tests.
However, the arrival of the German army was interrupted.
In 1937, a draft of photoelectric accommodating rockets, designed by Rohozinski, was discovered in the professional press and the work of Rocket - torpedo air and rocket bomb by author Leviwy-Krzywoblocký, was released in the following year.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war with all projects of military use of rocket technology, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Timely Advisory and Scientific Committee) coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, the war ended.
Further work by the cosmonautics after the war in the Polish press is found thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautique Society (Polish Association of Astronautiques).
First, there is a mention of the company in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problem, in which there are four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronauts.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowice, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with the cosmonautique.
At that time, projects of artificial machines were already underway and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has tried to join the International Astronautic Federation (based in 1951) and has become a proper member in the fall.
And next year, PTA President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
This function was stopped until its death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has played a significant role in the development of highly successful meteorological missiles RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish missile to be conducted by scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on October 10, 1958.
The 1,800-meter-access rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built and two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledovian Desert in 1959.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development should already have been capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the wind.
However, in 1962 another development was halted.
As a successor to the first RM-type rockets, Meteor-1 was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which vary the size of the space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was room with a volume of 0.4 litre, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres.
Maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, whose first flight trials began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The following versions were built: Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is still necessary to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland also participated in the Interkosmos programme in space exploration in Soviet art teams and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkovi.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The resolution has led to a lively discussion in the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, the unlimited movement of private capital along with unrestricted financial speculation.
The impact of significant differences in the price of work (semb) is the result of price tension.
Under this definition, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer is trying to import the cheap goods into a competitive competition by "stirring" the price of the competitor in order to increase its market share and thereby increase its own profits.
In mass measure, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production to abroad, or to buy cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
As private capital has no social responsibility and thus also the responsibility for its job created, the social expenditure of the State is increasing.
The whole situation makes it possible to pay taxes to the total disregard of the employers and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused by the loss of profits.
The situation is so widely known that no specific statistical data should be provided.
Independent private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments pay tribute to private capital to their own population regardless of the social loss.
This is particularly evident in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to make it economically necessary for its own population to accept the price dictatorship of private capital in particular in the area of wages.
However, this is a system of economic recovery in the case of long-term unemployment, but a limitation of the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is growing along with the growing differences between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN, there have been a number of years of public food spending for the poor who cannot enjoy their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for properly employed people to receive such wages that they must be paid up to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary workers in the social security sector.
The controversial measures of virtually all the southern EU states are undoubtedly leading to the same state when people are forced to migrate under the pressure of a disaster at social level, as it was in the 19th century, or to live for a cold wage on the edge of society, hoping that private investment capital will come to the country once.
Where is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, poverty is moving from one country to another, or it does not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, or Africa are still working as a breach of the European vengeance.
It's all about Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital shall be held in strict accordance with the opinion that the State may not take the lead in the economy.
Then we need to ask ourselves whether private capital is not affecting, in fact, politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
There's a clear answer here, yes.
Evidence of existence is practically omnipotent and in all states available lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation where virtually everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In the SRN, the situation is such that government ministries for the lack of financial resources are making proposals for laws to private legal firms that are in a bad position in relation to industry.
These draft laws are then approved in Bundestag.
Not all of this comes from people like Western institutions, but from financially strong groups of people who prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly getting into the situation described by Appianos in its part of the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeia: "The state has long been in complete disbandment and the authorities have been obsessed with violence.
For bribes, illegal acquisition, and by means of stones or swords.
The bribes and corruptions went out without any bans and people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice" ..."the character of people were not at all concerned about the office, so once it was the result of this diversion that was a state of eight months without consuls." . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As in the past, the present company is based on independent preferences of its own advantage, regardless of the overall public interest.
Private capital is no longer in a position to understand and apply the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is now, as at the time, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform a deeper race.
Therefore, we must look for the succession of fascist and communist regimes in the unprecedented liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
At present, the decline in these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break with the expectation of another round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring possible statistical losses in the lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are now witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a solution, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of competition, both at international and intra-European levels, the Czech Government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
So this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that strengthen the capital participation of the State in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.

After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, many reactions were generated, as always.
One stands behind Israel, argues his right to self-defence, and the Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue against the Israeli state's racism, genocide in the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fits into the role of the terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who has been regularly killed by the repeated waves by the culprits and who has been killed by the victims, at the end of today's Israelis, including self-government territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I am going to offer the readers a look at the opoon, a view of which has been serving above all 95 years of tension (calculated by the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) for a small part of the Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the historical facts available, some of them are taken away on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main source of the events of modern history.
The acts of mankind are primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can look for someone like Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always those personalities who were totally autonomously guiding their steps and whether or not someone was behind their throne who directed their actions towards the above-mentioned goal.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and its power cannot be attained by one generation.
Among these astronomical rich families is an educational one that could be considered the head of the octopus (if someone is still standing over them I don't know, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschild.
It's not much about them.
Of course.
The first printing agency (Reuters) had already been bought in the 1990s to stop the merger of its name with the highly criminal effects in which they stood and which always signified the strengthening of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank do not lead or prepare wars (before the attacks of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attacks of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Kaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia subjugated the central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to fight this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank of Rothschield's Bank of America, began to spend his own money during the civil war (including government) and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the FED, he was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the outbreak of a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of three world wars as the highest, 33rd degree dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war was intended to eliminate large monarchist states in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial rule, in particular the United Kingdom, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world population to some 0.5-1 billion people (such a multitude of slaves for their conveniences and luxury and do not need so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prerequisite for such a solution) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method that the group of the richest families in front of Rothschielda is working is the call for a crisis and the following offer of a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
These solutions, however, are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, so that the crisis like the one they created in 1907 does not happen again).
So after they managed to kill the Hasbour successor of the R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to launch the first world war, the Russian Empire destroyed by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, military and economicly unresolved, the capital of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy the Russian Empire) and subsequently broke the central European power, Austria Uherska.
In order to facilitate the resolution of the second world war, the politicians left behind a latency conflict situation by creating huge war repairs on Germany, creating the assumption of radicalisation of the masses of the proponents, and then only to encourage the Germans to be strong enough, to blame the leaders and the simple solution offered by the leader, and further to the creation of a multinational Czechoslovakian with a strong German minority, which was to multiply, and also to multiply, the function of the fifth colony, at the start of the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschild’s foundation of the Zionist movement, whose one poem sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem, would be the capital city (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began to come to first sights with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out if Hitler broke out of the chain that the international bankers initially held, or everything he had done was difficult to estimate, then any suffering of European Jews in concentration created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war repairs made by Germany in World War II, a third war was set up by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If the international bankers are able to disband it, the Jewish nation, like in the second, will be the victims of the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of weight and chaos not only within the country, but also in international scale (let us take only as strong people share in favor and support of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where the crime of violence is rooted in an endless chain of violence, when, at the beginning of all, the greed of individuals and their desire for global power began?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers insist on elections for people exclusively their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is Netanyahu, a typical example of the fascising, to international loyal bankers, a policy that is doing everything to spread war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to increase in global conflict and in view of Iran's control over the Hormuz Gulf, which travels 20% of all the world's oil (a navigation corridor only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of lords and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serve the comfort of financial aristocracy.
A world where every new born individual is implanted in the birth of a chip that makes it a completely controlled being.
"And force all the small and great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves, to have on their right hand or on their foreheads, that they should not buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or the number of its name.
That's to understand: who has the mind to count the numbers of the helmet.
It's a man's number, and it's a six-six-six."
Film Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he held a band of demonstrators of Islamic students at the American Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released as a replacement for the caste of Mohammed Réz Páhalvi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, who was the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive starting point - it could not afford to take a trip across the ship because it would thus substantially endanger the trust of allies in other countries.
The release of hostages, however, was not able to achieve in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was the morning for the United States Prestige, which later deepened the fiasco's attempt to free the armed forces.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days after the negotiation was mediated by the Algerian government.
Their contribution at home caused the wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debate in Iran has made a significant contribution to the loss of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film directed by the actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that America has brought a small victory.
Just before the embassy was seized, six employees fled.
After the difficult peripecies, they ended up in a Canadian embassy residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get them from Iran, while helping the extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film staff, who saw the location in the country for filming sci-fi grand film.
Combined Genres
A plan that invented an expert on "exfiltration" by Tony Mendez also demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
For the legend to be credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, organized a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, the film comes from Tony Mendez's memory.
Aflexk's film is a special combination of several genres.
On one side a realistic political thriller, at the same time called "caper movie", the story of a piece, a subtly - can be an example of Danny's series of partners.
In the film, the moods - on the one hand, the documentary sequences from Tehran (the title sequence shows the iconic time photography of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in that).
On the other hand, remote passports from Hollywood, combined with irony and a slight overlap.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in the suit are breaking up the situation at the action tables, at the office halls, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has been able to relaunch his career in a remarkable way.
From a funny actor, he became a respected director, and his heredity ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third all-night film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller of the City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Afflekk's video that's not being played in the director's home Boston.
Cit for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the director's older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are played in the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is effective in its overview, which at the same time mediate the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that occur when history is cleared somewhere.
Similar effects of Affleck and its collaborators are achieved in the scene of thought (false staff on the Tehran Basar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story in question does not actually offer much in the film-based sense of tense scenes.
It works quite well with this little, sometimes thinking about the reality - everything is no longer so elegant (the scene in which a dangerous crisis at Tehran airport turns the phone in America and the knife after the wound acts quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the frustration resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and they are not far from alone in this film.
Aflexk's film is so much lost in dramatic tach, it's a picture that can be watched with a little interest, evaluate the performance and retro style evocating thrilllers in the 70s.
But it's just hard.
As a reminder of a certain way of living history and the evidence of how exaggerated ideas about all - powerful and all - aware secret services are being made.
Rules for the injection of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipopakky.com, which publishes an annual survey on the most absurd banking fee, has now decided to declare the competition "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU's business".
"It has led us to the last event when the EU plans to accept a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said the Law organiser of the Patrick Nader survey.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the merger of insurance rates for men and women.
Thus far, women have benefited from life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote on its own will then take place by the end of February 2013," Naker informed.
The EU Controversial Regulation also requires the mandatory mixing of biodegradable substances into naturally harmful substances, further banning the use of reliable mercury temperatures only because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of adhesives, for which the eggs have been significantly damaged this year.
Critics have previously also faced a factual ban on the use of the expression of anointed butter or the removal of classical bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas should have 14 centimeters
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually met by some state or group of states (this is why the Czech Republic now and the threat of veto is promoting the requirements of its banks).
The lobby interest was also due to the fact that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to reach a length of at least 14 cm and should not show "anonymous distortion".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising only today's incompatible national standards that have complicated trade.
The rules on fruit and vegetables already in force in the EU through the resistance of some Member States have softened by pointing out that the existing Directives lead to food consumption.
The candidate for victory in the survey may also be the last EU regulation, under which it must be pointed out that children under 8 years of age should not be inflamed without the supervision of adults.
The EU has turned to American research, according to which balloons between players lead to the death of children to breath.
Similar restrictions are now applicable for children up to 14 years of age when snooping in the faucets.
Curious ideas are born at home
It is a rather absurd rule, then, concerning the European officials themselves, that anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the theme for Greece and must instead speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Banking Fees.com server, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the questionnaires, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, should also the EU Regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has set maximum levels of food stocks that could be found in the territory of the PRC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, certain volumes of preserved mushrooms for which he was threatened by a high torment.
The survey organisers have also raised the idea of paying some countries for having no sea, and the idea of granting grants on request for grants.
These ideas, however, did not come up in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're disabled because we don't have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for reimbursement," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, we were born with a lot of crops and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, we had to keep up with the stocks that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic continues to have ports, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros, according to the Palais.
Finally, the European Commission came out of the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive the grant was offered by the local ministry for local development managed by Minister Pavl Germany (US-DEU), which should specifically go to write a request for a grant from Brussels.
EU: The Bistrial Regulation is an exception
Although the regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, EU regulatory efforts and at the same time more efficient functioning and development across the Union deserve greater recognition, according to a number of experts.
The more serious problem is, according to experts, for example, the use of EU grants to projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have won in budgetary negotiations.
Emotion between the Czech Republic is also driven by the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Union countries, must fight for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products in Brussels, and it will not always succeed in this conflict.
Although the Czechs, after the sixth battle with the Germans and the Rakušans, came to mark the Olomoucian forms, but the foreign rum, whose tradition reaches the 19th century, had to be named by our producers.
The name of the rum may only bear products of trimming distillate, not sugar beet.
In the official list of EU registered products, in the company of world-renowned cheeses of feta and gorgonzola, marzipan from Germany, Lübeck or parm hams, for example carlovar sugar, raspberry and raspberries and javelin starch.
The EU's protection mark can then also be proud of the pardubic washing machine and the hot tubing.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, tough Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
I'm not talking about being a senator or president.
If it works in our country without problems, I don't care.
But I can't see how the country's been stealing for the last 20 years, how the thieves are running, people get tax and retirement age.
I wasn't supposed to be a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been forty years old and I'm an independent nanny, I have no other way to influence things than to run for a senator or president.
You've reached the Senate, but you've come out to the Garden.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying that I'm going to fight the Hrad as a result of the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected a senator, I would run for the president.
My goal is, but it's not a function, it's a tool I can make my vision come true.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the problem is not only that as a nation we're buying at home and on TV, but that we're sinking anyone who wants to try to change.
In addition to this, the media that denounze people and that distort freedom of speech lie with freedom of speech.
I must have claimed that I was paying for the press or that I was the advisor of Jiří Paroubka.
Let's go to your visas.
In the fight for the Garden, you have emerged with your aunt's serious and criminal responsibility for policies and return property confessions of over twenty million.
You have to change the law to that.
As president, you have no such authority and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for leadership to be free of joy, it worked.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or the right, they say no, and the citizens hold back.
As an independent citizen, I have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My privilege is to take something that is best for our country, on every side and apply it.
You think you're more of a right-wing man or a left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are looking at me on the left rather than on the left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little transport.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any very good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSCHM or the ODS, and I will be against the wrong idea anyway.
You're flattered when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you make a business plan in the company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or important experts have been talking about.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have passwords left.
And that's not what you're doing in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you follow people and talk to them, you will be able to do something like a criminal and a serious responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side so that we can pass on to them.
If I have been elected President, it is not a problem to arrange a direct television broadcast, where I ask the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to commit a serious and criminal liability to politicians, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want her.
If there's a strong personality that's going to name the dirty ones, you can press the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, it was a public press duty.
At the same time, I say I'm an amateur, I'm not either a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find a union.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get most support for my program.
I'm trying to clean things up myself, if it doesn't work out, in six years I'm going to end up and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been running a number of famous people to make sure they don't go to the Senate too.
I went to Radim Janchuru, who refused to do so much work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jan Lorenzo, who was covering up frauds with light oil.
I've run with people being really upset, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and those who left chose most of the representatives of the establishment.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People called on the Senate so that changes would be made difficult.
Still, I will fight for my vision, such as for the direct choice of the elderly or the heitman.
You're thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven't considered it yet, because I don't have time to check the pure past of every potential party, and I don't have any money on it.
I don't even have money on the presidential campaign, but on my transparent account, there's only 20,000.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I'm estimateing private property to about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land of about 25 million, an apartment of ten million, another apartment of eight million, a collection of works of art of about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my cuckoo dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil and evil.
You drive Aston Martin, you own 60 million and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
Is that what I'm supposed to owe you?
I've killed 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors testifies that my program is probably not so interested.
And I don't have to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I'm going to get a senator's salary.
But I wouldn't make it out of it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't give anybody.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd decide these activities?
But it doesn't matter how much you pay.
As I promised, I've taken part in my activities.
For example, a travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How many businessmen have you been used to taking a month?
Two hundred to 400, which I'm taking further.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
The entire conversation will be found in the Saturday edition of the Law.
Architects MVRDV are evidence that real adventures are not just in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Hora books - 2 pictures
"This building seems to me happy, futuristic. It is finally again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technology in a nearby big business, says, "Of course, this house is nice."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
None of these old-fashioned books are volunteering today, are they?
Spijkenisse, a location close to Rotterdam without its own work opportunities that are not even worth visiting, holds a special record.
This area of 80,000 people shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision fell to contribute to universal education and build seven beautifully painted iron concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges on eurobanks.
The success of the education of the offensive was not at all repugnant.
And so the councillors knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Viny Maas from the Rotterdam architectural workshop MVRDV, master of bold column charts and designer of funny, often even cynical buildings, took over the thing with ordinary peace and at a competition in 2003 with five books under guard and brilliance on the face.
And while the commission looked around and shook its shoulders in awe, Maas poured out his gifts on himself according to his size and his activistly reasoned speech ended with the words "Dear City Village!"
So this is my proposal on the Mountain of Books in Spijkennisse, called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a 30 million-euro mountain was designed.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row homes with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Hora books were named by the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated at the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town grass, which has not yet been offered more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually bad worker whose white facade you would rather expect a milk shop, is richer than a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenze now has the first public cultural building in the history of his existence.
Long Path to the Book
First sentence: the reader's eldorado under the cover of cheese.
By means of the mountain mass, however, lifts, but real spatial and readerial passions you will discover until you walk through topography.
On all sides, the exposed interior is bright and transparent, the floor of a burning cab and elegant street lights clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see the park wallets, the dog and the boys and the girls playing football.
And books everywhere, books, books.
"There are normally rules with books along the facade and in the middle there is a big dark space, which is mostly insolvent and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We set up a classic space configuration and we moved the space for the reader outside.
The interior of the Hory books is beautifully used: on Wednesday there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and central home technology.
Special comforts are black police on books that are once covered with walls, one parapet and the other shingle stairs.
Look, the structure and the smell affect the alien.
Over the unknown building material, the heads even bend the architects and construction engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, a project leader in the town of Spijkenisse, on a standard magazine question.
And so in a fresh farm one day we found a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years it has been used in glass and in fields in the Netherlands as a base under the root of a millimetre of synthetic material.
It's cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile will last one, two seasons, and then it's mature for discharge into the bulk waste.
For the library there was a hole - first in such a quantity - on the 4 cm thick board.
The effect of the fire and pressure on the so-called Agricultural Plastic (CLP) will color in dark, homogeneous and heavy material, which smells a little like a new car and a little like sports boots.
You'll reach the top of 105 feet.
At the end of nearly 500 meters of long trip you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch Croquets and Fikus in flowering.
You're taking care of the atmosphere, but mostly of the correct humidity of the air in the upper literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is in spite of many glassed areas with an example project on ecology," Trouborst says.
It melts and cools with earth's heat.
Though the Mountain of the Book stands under a glass roof, the sun only shines within a short period of time, even in the sun’s day.
The wide, beautiful wooden lockers, which stand next to the façade, serve as a stifling and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
With the rest, he'll handle full automatic roles.
Stefan Spermon, an IT industry initial skeptic, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, which Boekenberg even refers to as "a long-awaited soul" Spijkenzi.
Reason: Each city resident was invited to open up a book from his own personal fund a few weeks ago.
Thus, optical spaces should be first filled in so far not fully equipped library, which currently contains 70,000 pieces.
The concept is certified.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every citizen has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if she was just in the mood.
This was done by MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of identity in the professional jargon.
Spijkenzene wrote a history of literature.
Whatever it is young and uneducated.
That's finally the starting point for identity.
Shabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting when it decided to adopt Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the USA and Europe, Stephen Szaboa thus balances Berlin on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Schabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll even support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical to Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to establishing a zone.
It finally passed NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stand on serious international issues?
Yes, that's right.
The reason is that he's just changing his foreign policy, and that's the direction from the policy that was being addressed to the US, the direction to German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult than the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just staying in their role, but they're on their way to "normal" foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or in the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent of the positions of the USA or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interest affect the position in the Middle East conflict and vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a large resort in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public, but not the elite in the Arab countries.
That's what it's all about.
I don't want to add too much importance to that, but it's not just a one-sided relationship.
However, it plays a very important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States when both important decisions were held in favour of the vote, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there will be a great understanding for the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as Libya's question.
I hope Germany even earns some respect.
This signals that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has made a clear statement about the veto.
Are there differences in opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal policy.
I think that the Obama government has a considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of that political situation, this attitude cannot, of course, stop the public.
I think that differences in opinion are really not as big as they always seem.
When you look at relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very interested in Netanyahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to establish in line with its close relationship with Israel and the USA on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little easier if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not happening at this time.
So they can't be part of a wider line and they have to take things forward from their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future and will push Europe into a European position.
Of course, that's not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive topic.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a greater role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, when Germany assumes a greater role, anti-German moods will arise.
That doesn't make it difficult for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to the most diverse neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
The impact of the United States on European politics is constantly falling, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the present time.
The Germans are just going to have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and it's making them even more popular - c'est la vivi!

"Protected brand" in China: when Puma and Armani are all of a sudden Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What about Armani Polo?
This is followed by a label that is officially registered in China but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they enjoy protection for as long as they are not blamed by actual brand owners.
And it's not even clear if they get the right.
"It is increasingly difficult for a foreigner to protect his trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violating the rights in the Far East.
Every week, there'll be a new case on my writing table.
A couple of letters are enough for the falcons to sign up for their badges.
From the Gucci brand, for example, Lu-Gucci will become and instead of Prada let Prada-Kny register.
In this way, German companies, like the Puma sports product manufacturer, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens the order with the registrations of the Marking Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, one Chinese company left to protect Zegna DF Puma’s brand. An artificial name that also parasites at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the world's masters in copying and violating mental property.
In large cities there are several commercial houses, in which pets are sold almost exclusively.
However, the patent cases are different. From the mandate of its mandates, it is against the fact that the Chinese companies have the right to use the label that has already been protected elsewhere from the flag authority.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", the associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
That's what women are talking about, hunting rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It harms the trade, we have to chase it," Pattloch calls out.
"The badge will sort out, the exclusive position will disappear, the damage of the image is huge."
Financial losses and the costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest market in luxury goods and markets, with a turnover of 15 billion euros per year.
However, the existence of questionable records in the trademark register can be difficult and is worth something.
Control can take up to nine years, with a different result.
Pattloch reports cases when the court dismissed the lawsuits because the title was deleted after a long period of "market reality".
When he has a complaining party to the tragedy, he still has to pay for the plague because he has damaged his badge in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Known cases are also related to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost his legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, a company that recently took over a German producer pumped on the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use a emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that reminded BMW. The spore was balanced, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with fans from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the known crocodiles in the wrong direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
However, the TCMO authorities admitted that there were insufficient staff and space in 2010 due to too small numbers of employees.
But last year, it was reportedly "the process of work returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 per cent.
There were 57,000 of these cases closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Something to do against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China is behind it is leading a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - of which there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were selected at the fee.
This simply means that each application is equivalent to 1280 June or 160 euros.
The beginning of this dispute is several times what the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting the Chinese Plagiarism for more than seven years.
Even so, the Germans have achieved the abolition of its illegal production of imitation car parts.
However, the facilitator secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand still.
We would remind ourselves of this because in Germany the names cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The TCMO's flagship also rejected the opposition from the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg gained the right, but the resistance in the dispute continues to fight today.
We need to be careful.
Now the matter is discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler trusts that the matter will lead to a good end and commend the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "Driving is extremely expensive and it takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be counted. In the company archive, they had to even look at the old records for a hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg, on the other hand, offered a "high six-digit amount in euros" for the purpose of settling the dispute.
"You see what that means to us," says Wenzler.
The danger of the Far East also threatens Europe.
And that's when the copyrs get unprotected.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign up in Germany for Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This area of business has long been given up, but it has been able to reverse registration.
"It's necessary to be careful," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch lawyers advise German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade marks rights. Citizens would rather have "everything that stands for protection, even login in China," says Wenzler.
Otherwise it could be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg, in the last story of his drama, is subject to a sign, then it is likely that it will have to pay licensing fees on the other hand for its own name, explains Wenzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World Day of Fighting AIDS: Assembling, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the congregation of Imbongi is being tested - and in Swaziland the orphans are happy to see the parents who died of AIDS.
The history of the compound, which exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there's a kick: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and ladies' mocasins are looking for a tat park and they're looking for it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - allalt, bass, tenor and soprano - are slowly lifted up, moms and each other reach each other.
The 29-year-old director Fiete Hopfa almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he connects his voices with his hairy wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbongi is testing a new song.
There were 50 singers and singers between 23 and 69 years of age, from a researcher on human genetics to the home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy composition, each congregation voice has a different text and, in addition, in a very foreign language - Zulu, which speaks to eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotha, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to Help Yourself
Unaids, the United Nations Programme for the Suppression of AIDS, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of that 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans by parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans by parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitni, the Voicees for Africa found patterns in Germany.
70 of them attend second grade school.
In 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the patronage.
Guarantees children a school, a school uniform and one hot meal every day in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means in the Zulu language "the editor of stories" or also "the one who loves."
No one can speak in this room with a gas tank, just sing.
For nearly ten years he has been practicing the congregation of songs in this foreign soft speech and sometimes he has brought them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
In the air distance of 8,733 km from Heidelberg, the village of Esitni is located in the northeastern part of the Swedish Kingdom, which depends on the ability of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty percent Is Infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay or strawberries. Most of them are children.
More than 300 of them don't have parents anymore, because they've been subjected to HIV.
In Estonia it is seen in small, as the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The male predisposal unit, which manifestly reduces the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland are wearing a weakened immune virus inside themselves, and there is no reason to die in the next 30 years.
This village was visited by the congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. However, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who were not only missing parental care, but were cleaning everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completed school education, they have no chance in the poor country at all.
At first, it was a private placement of individuals who, in a few euros a year, allowed the child to go to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a group of "Voices for Africa" was established, which has been taking care of orphans by parents who have died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPI belongs to syphilis, chlamydia and dog (gonorrhea).
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mounds and cracks belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belong to the most affected group?
Syphilis and dogs are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The constitution of Robert Kocha is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilides reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases are common, Chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidosis (nearness), dog and human papillomavir.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of newly infected HIV belongs to this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among young people than among other population groups.
According to European research, three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common among young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of syphilis infected by Robert Kocha was more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2001 according to the Constitution of 1697.
The number of newly infected HIV is decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It's about a dozen less than a year ago.
What are some signs of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause fever in the area of genitalia, difficulty in urine, rash, abdominal pain, or chest pain.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, so they will not be noticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Hazardous diseases can reduce condoms, but they do not offer pistachios protection.
Because the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted also by infections caused by uncleanness and close physical contact.
This is why experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent sexual intercourse.
In the case of timely diagnostics, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charity gifts, and in the last number of honoraries that the congregation earns by singing all over Germany, some money is collected.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estonia," said the president of the company Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious woman who can be planted.
She also cares about the need for sharp - looking children to find shelters, such as in some grandmothers.
Gogo, as Zulu calls old women, are the village's fortress.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children were delivered to the school every day in uniforms.
Children who no longer have anyone, go to a shelter in Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the community as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
"Voices for Africa" also founded a sewing school, built two cooks, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had to perform a HIV test.
It's not obvious, even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King to 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because she has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's quite strange in the country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absoluteist monarch of black Africa, King Miswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
Let's compare democracy to democracy.
This country's approved way of life, among other things, is also guilty of the spread of HIV in the past decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread viruses across the earth.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To at least support cultural exchange, the Imbongi Congregation travels once in two, three years together throughout South Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, fighting, confidence in the future and self-confidence of black people who have known many in the southern tip of the Black continent since the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of the blacks - such appreciation brings not only the mood and joy, but also tears have already gone out among many wild border soldiers.
The road also leads to Estonia, where singers visit the children over whom they have patronized.
Even though this village is hard to find on maps, in the valley of the river Eulweni is more than known.
"Go to Estonia, there's light," people say.
And when you get back to Heidelberg, which is an air-circuit 8733 kilometers away, to the snorkeling singers in the experiment at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that light shines here too.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercury ice
Sonda Messenger found evidence that Mercury is iced.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US National Aviation and Cosmonautique Agency (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although the nearest Sun is located, there is also frozen water, as it flows from three studies published on Thursday's "Science" professional magazine.
Sonda Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies in the permanent shadow.
It's probably at least 30 centimeters and maybe up to 20 meters strong.
This water came according to everything from the comet or perhaps even from the asteroids that attacked Mercury.
Let us not, however, find ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leading scientists working on the Sensenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life were brought to other areas of the solar system.
The probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, undetected earth, with the participating exploration of the depth of the universe.
From time to time, they've gone to Earth with pictures, a small window to endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the celestial planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which surrounds the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006 "planet".
This intersection from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the most identifiable are pink coloured "news" in the birthroom of stars.
This area where the stars are formed - scientists call it W5 unromantic - has discovered Spitzer's telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia in the distance of 6500 light years.
This variable star-morning event caught Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The interlocking ring consists of a material that the star exploded during the process of dying.
In the huge Trifid mill, which is 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from the gas and dust.
The photo of the galactic "complexes" was ordered by the NASA Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiades Star, also called "Seven Sister", is at night to see with a simple eye.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors are better.
The male Helix can look like a red eye on this infrared image.
It is located at the distance of 700 light-years from the constellation of Water.
Her similarity to the Earthquake produced this tiny name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the origin of unusual coloring.
This "minimum" among the stars has been able to climb in full beauty to the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how they came up is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
I hope it's about the remainder of Saturn's moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of Hubble's greatest and most outstanding images: a faith galaxy
The images of the spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real artistic pieces.
The drawing published by the European Southern Observer shows a few thousand light-years away from the Trifid mill in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangle), because the dark dust strips divide the burning heart of this star bear into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonos, astronomers photographed the presence of a cosmic crash: at 400 million light-years away from Earth, the nucleus is a woman of two successive galaxies and must inevitably come to the coliseum.
This birth of the star recorded Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Whoever doesn't like technical shorts can call her the name of the South Windmill.
The photograph from Hubble's space wide view shows the intersection of the Iris butterfly in the Cefea constellation.
These 1400 light years are made up of dust grains, which are ten times as much as the usual domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It displays a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star cow there is the clearest group of young stars in our Milky Ways.
The cluster of stars gives rise to new growths.
Also, these star clouds, connected to the Rosette mill, still produce new young stars. They are 5,000 light years away from Earth.
There's still no dust in this clear glowing galaxy with a little black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was just a short time after the Great Depression when it was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our view of space: the most important telescopes
The remote view was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Even before Galileo, he later used it to observe stars.
Since then, optical remote views have been increasing - and the perspectives that mediate are getting deeper and deeper.
The world’s largest remote view was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale’s telescope at Palomar’s observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
Large Binocular Telescope stands in the American Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe by just two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
Inside Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10,4 meters on average.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
However, its average reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap design: the telescope is secured by a high angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the high angle.
His specialty is a high-strengthing of the light stream.
Despite a relatively small average, this is equal to the world's largest mirror remote views.
Radiotelescopes in Arecibu, Puerto Rico, are being monitored by scientists in space by extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.
For "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - looking for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who provides its computing power.
Look at the observer of the European Southern Observer (ESO) in the Chilean Andeans.
He's standing here with Very Large Telescope and honoring his name.
This remote view with a total of four mirrors can also brighten the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large distance is also planned for the Chilean ESO observatories.
Its main mirror shall be full of 42 metres and shall consist of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck's remote views of Mauna Kea's Hawaiian soup were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They're offering two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keckov's remote views are part of the Mauna Kea observatorium, which is also looking into space and using the telescope Subaru and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea is to create a new large telescope - with a diameter of 30-foot mirrors.
Here you can admire her on the picture.
However, the most important perceptions from the universe is that of Hubble's cosmic remoteness.
The arrests of distant worlds have been provided to us since 24 April 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
The image shows the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
James Webba (JWST) will be launched into space on board the Ariane 5 rockets first in 2018.
The primary mirror of the infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and the galaxy after the Great Depression.
Scientists are based on the fact that there's ice on the south of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the Messenger circles around this planet closer to the northern field.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and which is the first one that runs around Mercury, scientists now have confidence.
Drink butter daily and get 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live in Bible times.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a trail in a country where 97 years of age are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live in Bible times.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a trail in a country where 97 years of age are still relatively young.
I'm going to burn Talysh. We can call the wilder romantic.
The microbus counting along the road with many plots along densely forested hills, ancient rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and happy, almost like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this one here is the most beautiful of them in Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is a Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyshes, which is not known enough to speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani, and is living at a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This city is being hunted by too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is not suitable for the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. The arrival from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too easy.
At 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-way.
The historic wealth for which countries thank oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is convinced, however, that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Grand Prix Eurovision in May - and we will have the oldest festival in the world next year," Fatulajeva says.
He's the director of a museum of longevity, about the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of nearly eight dozen Talyshs from around, who are hundreds of years old. Fatulajeva shows black and white pictures.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
However, the contested star of this museum is the shepherd of the sheep of Şyrali Müslümov, which was apparently 168 years old.
There's no such thing as a birth certificate.
And since the oldest man with the evidence was 122 years old, Muslim age seems to be highly questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulajeva explains.
This man was probably married three times and had 23 children.
So he didn't make a mistake in his old age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about the flying people in Central Asia.
"Schoolz says, "also lives in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan."
No scientific evidence of age, however, is available due to the lack of evidence, especially when the matrix is missing.
Each day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact is, though, that people in the area around Leric are likely to experience Bible age.
There are currently 20 people who are 100 years old.
So why do so many flying people live here in the south?
Azerbaijan's leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of Fatul's museum, on the other hand, believes it's life-long.
However, just the caloric diet of the Talyshes who love meat, bread and, above all, milk products, and of which many drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromateological point of view it is not quite reliable.
Or is this the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, the home of Rubab Mirzajev.
In 97 years, it is still relatively young on this geographical scale.
Mirzajev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasian region.
He's sitting on the ground with a butcher that he's not wearing.
Under one roof, eight people live here, including one of the sons of Mirza's and the daughter's, both of whom are fathers long ago.
There's two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is given in typical "armada" crystals.
The white Mirza's teeth form a perfect row and under the coat they hide a long dark blonde copy that proudly exposes her son to us.
I always loved my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and they kept their color.
"That's how I never used shampoo," says Mirzaev.
The monthly income to life is enough
She always ate only what came from her own backyard, paradise, potatoes, games.
For the rest of my life, I never bought food in a supermarket once.
Then he'll tell me about his man who was in the army.
The worst thing was for World War II.
But it all improved when he took over the "loved father" Gejdar Ali's.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is made around the throne of the father of the nations, who ruled his land as governor, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over his son Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan, at least they don't have to.
Mirzajeva receives a salary of 230 manats every month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the area from which it can be used.
And maybe it's true that a long time ago, Mirza's son is saying, "The old people live in our culture of great seriousness."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for, and happy.
If there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "lid law" in the constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Kahiry.
Angry demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep dissatisfaction.
A sharp debate is being held on the future constitution based on the right of the Sharia.
The president of Egypt didn't run a path.
We need to create a transition.
"And for our success, I am responsible, before men and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian Coptics, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims, and the secular people.
All of them, so far hopelessly disillusioned in a confused opposition, that's because they're afraid.
Fear of "God's state" on the Nile for the grace of a powerful Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost apologized to him for transitionally limiting the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and extending his powers to "save the revolution".
But what a 61-year-old engineer who has the title of a doctor of the American University in southern California really wants to save, in which the Egyptians have no clear world.
Is justice supposed to be out of power?
234 paragraphs, which were soon approved in the 15th hour marathon by the Chief Constitutional Assembly with the influence of Islamists, are a partial cause of concern.
As in previous institutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists are using this vague formula and the associated legal free space for a closer interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this sheds light on the new paragraph: In all matters relating to the Sharia, it is necessary to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great impact on the whole Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to, but it can mean that the chlorine will be supervised by the legislature, which would give justice a real sense of self-reliance.
In the proposal of the Constitution there are many things of interpretation
The problem is also that the civil authority of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubara's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As proposed, it should also protect "the right of the Egyptian family and support its morals and values".
This is so precise that by means of this paragraph, state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature.
In a understandable word, it means nothing but censorship.
No other paragraph in writing shall exclude the explicit equality of men and women.
That is why another paragraph prohibits a Hanobit or apologise to the prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
However, there is a lack of clarity as to what corruption is and how it will be achieved.
There is no doubt in the wording that "infecting people" is prohibited.
Is it enough in this case that the president's caricature or a joke on the law-enforcement account?
The matter of interpretation, as many others in this proposal, which Mursí submits for signature, and according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of a human vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For a few weeks, opposition has been formed against the sending of Islamists.
Tens of tens of people gathered on Friday night at Tahrír Square in Kahir and promised to destroy the constitutional bill before they started paying.
"The revolution has returned and we win," said Hamdin Sabbáhi, who was in the third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize Carrier and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, declared that the constitution's proposal was "to the site of history".
By means of the short news service, Twitter accused Mursí of wanting to carry out a "put against democracy".
"If he issues the referendum, we will go to his palace and drop it," said the opposition member Jásir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not being punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Chalda Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to look at the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood issued a protest, but not with caution at Tahrí Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the Kaahir University.
She was attended by many distraught women and supporters of the Salafists who called out: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
They called out to Murse: "Make the earth clean," and they said: "The Qur'an is ours."
The struggle for superiority over the symbolic territory of Tahrí, where it all began, would likely lead to a similar state of civil war.
Mursy's subjects obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opposition and the supporters of the constitution were loud and clear.
Now is the time to let people in the election hours decide which way the country should go.
Of course, the majority are considered to be in favour of the Islamic proposal.
"The word 'lid law' doesn't exist at all"
The imposed constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, is the anniversary of the Abu Sa'du Court.
Eighty-eight years human rights defenders and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or in court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
He was beaten, sentenced, and imprisoned for that.
"And in the new constitution now there are no 'lid law' words at all," she complains in the interview for "Welt am Sonntag."
The Mursi extension of power to all three power components in the state has enabled this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"The place for the president to strengthen the civil society, he actually canceled it," complains Sa'da.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which follows the battle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be his fault.
The demonstration at Tahrír Square warns: "You have created a monster you can't control anymore."
Norwegian crustaceans: The world's most fragrant fish?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the local appetite for extraordinarily fragrant fish?
Take a few mature cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a bunch of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie down for a week.
So you'll get all the paralysing smells of crustaceans, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the little town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's a snow, a beautiful view - and in the air there's all the smell available.
Rakfisk is a salty powder boiled in water for up to one year - depends on how much you want the fish to eat.
As it gets cold and cold, the Nora people here in Fagernes start meeting at the festival dedicated to this, as they say the best, most subtle food.
"You make it raw and then drink a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
People around us eat small pieces of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people would rather aquavitate than a crab," says Havard.
The potion can break the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's a similar piece of sushi that was on the long road by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no ice creams yet, fish in the autumn flocked to the airyards with water and salt.
Then in the middle of the winter, when they were well dried, pulled out, and ate, the meanings of alcohol no doubt drowned.
Just one generation ago, thousands of nuns were forced to leave their country and look for a job, most of which they emigrated to the United States.
At the present time, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants form the attachment of a large amount of work, high benefits and a comprehensive care system.
The people of Sweden, the old rival, who had been far richer than Norway, are moving to the country for work.
It is seen as something important, irrefutable, even though a relatively exciting part of the Norwegian past.
It's amongst the expensive food on the market.
Even though expensive is all - a small glass of beer or sandwich will take you out to 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway often fails to get to world news - and the majority of the population seems to do so.
The name Anderse Breivika, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here by people with a lack of taste.
Instead, the shooting is called "the escape from July 22nd."
The Norse can only hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
According to the current wealth of Norway, one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries has been growing since the early 1970 ’ s.
"But it's not the only reason why we're doing so well," she says when she gives the plates with our lady Anna's bedridden scarf, which with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents the prototype of the Nordic blessing.
We're, like you're told, big-time people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is quite unusual.
We don't pretend, we don't like chance.
Norway is very careful about its oil wealth - with the exception of a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for the future generation.
When all the others in the years leading to the global financial crisis were wasting money that they did not have, the Nors had a tight grip on their village.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"And eat cancer," he adds with no-old laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the front of something to eat - I've had enough cancer.
Such a bad burger is definitely something else and he's beautifully groomed.
But tonight's a fascinating fish back here.
The hotel, where I live, is one of many places where dinner is served and guests choose the best, or rather for the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to live television transmission, in which the moderator with the motel is surrounded by plates with the paint.
It's like a singing Eurovision competition.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Jurgene?"
"Here's our dot, Havard."
It's a relief and a smile.
A man will fall out of the chair, perhaps equipped with an aqueduct.
Or maybe getting rid of all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As the upcoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto prepares to take over the office, he considers Will Grant from the BBC the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is trapped even in the best times, steel barriers were created that closed several key routes into the main city and caused road chaos.
The aim, however, was not to prevent people coming to work, but to prevent Protestants from joining parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico Enrique Pena won't get a presidential scarf and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a demanding task.
Mexico, at the time of the departure of Felipe Calderon, was a good economic leader, but the country is in the war of drug warfare, which has already taken over 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to reducing violence against the Mexican people," President Pena Nieto told American President Barack Obama at the Oval Workshop at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he raised his hand with the American president, President Pena Neta gained political experience as governor of his home country in Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, a smooth and spacious state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute to it the development of tourism in aviation and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city after one of the new highways that Pena Neto has let you build. These roads are a huge improvement against the well and hilly roads that were there before.
Boards with its name also hang on the walls of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with a theme of climate change.
"We expect real and lasting change," said the friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state MP by President Pen Nieta, the institutionalised Revolution Party (PRI).
In particular, we look forward to interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our countries need so urgently.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicente Fox.
Ambassador Olver admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, many are expected to be inside Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And he rejects the statement of opposition that characterizes the new president as a man with no substance.
He's a very direct man, very busy with the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great citizen, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In the Nezaalcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the long streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Congested under road congestion in many remembers the suburb of Mexico’s own capital.
And problems in the self-employed community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called up to help with the control of drug gangs operating in the quarters, especially gunpower is violence against women.
Only in the last two years have there been a huge waste disposal of the body of poisoned women killed in empty places.
When Pena Neto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, Pena Nieta's criticism says that when she acted in the office, she failed to deal with the problem of women's murder.
And in the worst case, they blame him for closing their eyes.
In the concrete house, typical for the fourth quarter, Irinea Buendia shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luny and suppresses her crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body were washed away," recalls Mrs Buendia.
There were signs of strokes on him, and she's already starting to die.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is what the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old-fashioned snitch, a troublemaker and a boner.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there's so many mistakes and reminders," he says.
Sherpa, whom President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of dozens of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime and the new president has promised to be his priority during his office.
"I hope that he will be the same president as he was the governor," said PRI Olver in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what families in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the wrong behavior, the military prosecutor said.
The military prosecutor is trying to defeat Bradley Manning's claim regarding rude conduct in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of harsh treatment with Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that a soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest disappearance of secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many opportunities to complain about the gross conduct he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Prosecutor May. Ashden Fein at the cross-referencing of the Manning Army at the preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with the unit officials during the nine months of Quantica in Virginia show no complaints of maltreatment.
The cross-examination which occurred during the hearing of the defence proposal would refuse the case brought against Manning for the sake of gross conduct during a time of imprisonment that was sufficient to punish himself, took place on the day after Manning testified that he considered suicide in the prison.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online at WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein went through a form with Manning, which the officers completed after meeting Manning in a prison in Quantica, where he was held in the regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday on these forms, Manning admitted that the behaviour of his guards was "excellent" and the overall behaviour in the device was "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of maltreatment, even though Manning's officers directly asked how they were treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that concerns about various problems had been voiced and that officials who visited him had talked to him about these concerns and indicated that they would be taken care of, but these problems had not been identified.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing concerns), and it didn't necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain to his person in January 2011 at a meeting with the commission of suicides, which he expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The Army stated that it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under the surveillance regime for the sake of suicide) for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this wound prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before he was transported to a prison on the basis of maritime traffic in Quantica in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was thinking about suicide in Kuwait, and once there he fainted for a reason.
He stated that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what would happen to him in the surrounding world.
"My world just collapsed on the Arifján base, on the key," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving in Quantica he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in small goals without any company.
Manning said that he was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, a locker, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleep or just lying was during the day against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned the other night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's legal representative filed a formal complaint against Manning's army in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for the charges he filed in the Thursday statement concerning the fact that after having been forced to sleep one night in his goal in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other associates at the time of early reckoning.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to hide his cover when counting.
At a Friday hearing conducted by Judge Manning, he stated that by order of his guards he had decided to have a cover to cover, which he could hide, but admitted that no one had issued an order to postpone it.
On Thursday Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his phone rings to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that night his underwear, his phone rings and glasses were removed from his cell.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience of his imprisonment and that in the case of his testimony before the military court, whose beginning is expected to begin next year, his punishment will be significantly reduced.
The defense stated that it planned that Manning would be guilty in lower criminal offences and that he would fight against other charges because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was kept in accordance with the rules concerning all prisoners held in custody with maximum caution.
The charges brought against Manning include the assistance of the enemy, the unlawful reason for publishing information on the Internet, the transmission of information on national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is accused at all points, he may be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the inadequate possibilities there are.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, they say.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are greedy between the two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely broke up with the crowd and arrived in the area for the immigrant agenda, where I encountered a problem.
The strips pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Citizens").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexicon."
It's an ethnic short, just like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry," and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy."
So I ended up at the "Mexico American" label later.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, it wasn't necessary to use shorts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, pretty well to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the verbal resources of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American belt and set up a front for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto visited the White House of President Obama.
The programme had the usual issues to address when the leaders of the two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is as likely that Mexicans will remain in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a business block similar to that of the European Union in North America.
And Pena Neito promised to continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to transfer half of the Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think over the centuries, not for a minute, the comments are everywhere.
So a minute after the representative of the United States says something a little critical about Mexico, you hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaints about how Americans engage in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And Montezumy's kids are going on a war path.
Yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people that the country offers opportunities, and others that it doesn't.
The only reason that so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps a parent, who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from poor village, etc.
We're their descendants and we're loyal to them.
Not towards Mexico.
And even if we're living American dreams now, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we're living American dreams, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's in front of the United States.
And yet we realize that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and look at us as a sub-racial race that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our journey to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is, in their view, only a failure.
If our families didn't make it in Mexico, they would never leave it.
And we wouldn't be in jail for a hot tire now, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and when she was in her childhood legal residence in the United States, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans don't.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part or part of it.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigers del Norte, but Bruce Springstein as well.
You'll get the best of both countries, but you don't even have roots in one.
He's looking at us in Mexico like the Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence want me to re-connect with the diaspora, as I learned on my trip.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provision ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and press the political leader to establish relations with Mexico.
No, no, no.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of income and widespread corruption and drug abuse, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's on you, pals.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States the way they dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel ill about how they were treated with their family members in a much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an inexhaustible foundation for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next cycle of bleeding indicates that each such event is empty.
Among the usual unnecessary rumors about who started this, many buildings were turned into trouble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of civilians, and six Israelis. First, rockets from Gaza fell near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to have stuck in their former conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the resulting chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even more bloody than ever.
However, there is reason to believe that it can disrupt their mortal suffering situation.
A war that is neither saved nor saved.
At first glance it seems that there are not many reasons for optimism at the present time.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21st lasted, the fights this week strengthened the mine on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, an Islamic movement ruling in Gaza since 2007, will argue that they have forced the Israelites to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the worst and most natural corners of the planet, Hamas failed to destroy Israel.
And indeed, Hamas has an influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently under control by its busy rivals from Fatah, the more calmed Palestinian fraction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists all over the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the revitalized regional power, which was once the closest Muslim alliance in Israel, joined Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Prominent Hamas people say that the Islamic half-months are surrounded by Israel, north of Lebanon, where the ruling party/military Hizballah, across Syria, where rebels, who are still more inclined to Islam, can sit under Bashar Asad, after Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursí in Egypt, far from the southernmost and the complaining Arab country, in the region.
Husní Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood is the brotherhood of Hamas and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded either by Israel or by America.
On the contrary, the hard lines of Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
Hamas was put back in the military terminology.
The Israeli anti-fraud system The Iron Cup proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unparalleled as ever. Many European countries are also vinyl Hamas from the beginning of the last round of violence.
And above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahua, the president of the government, which largely ignored the peace process.
Although since 2004, rockets from Gaza killed about 30 Israelis, Israel has been relatively calm against suicide bombers, from the part of the wall that affects the West Bank, the main part of what the Palestinian state might once be, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite its illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose side Likud initially joined the 22nd January election with even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why should we insult those traitors by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, wouldn't they fire missiles like their countrymen in Gaza?
It'll be better if we keep them behind that wall and hit them when they're shaking their heads.
Maybe hard lines will win, but the Arab Spring can change their goals.
Although the Islamic people who gain power in Egypt and other lands do not have Israel too much in love, their primary priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defence expenditure is higher than the expenditure of all four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a new war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab government heal its economy.
The fact that President Mursí has collaborated with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites too should look at the situation from a long - term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates resistance to the Palestinians' right to self-determination with the shooting work that must one day explode in the areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Today, repression is weakening in the Jewish state of democracy and the demographic situation is even worse as the Arab population grows.
Blood spills against Gaza every few years for the purpose of pressing Hamas will continue to choose a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: two states where Israel will cross the border for security.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping the fire will give the outside pressure at least a little more influence on the passage of this thing.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must establish a stop to arms supplies to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arab outsiders must also press for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would have done more to create a Palestinian state than the immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations.
President Obama also has his part in getting Israel to the action table.
During his first election period, he ignored the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems to be equally expensive in its entry into the process.
That's unfortunately short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on dirty cigarette packaging came into force.
There are warnings for chickens and sick parts of the body on regardless of the green boxes that are the same for all brands of tobacco.
The Australian legislation on the cruel packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logos and colors replaced the usual olive green boxes with vivid images of the sick parts of the body and the sight of children and newborns who were ill as a result of the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the name of the labels printed in the same small letter must be the only difference between the boxes on Saturday.
It's the most accurate regime in the world with regard to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to turn young people away from smoking by eliminating this abuse.
It depends on a study that shows that if people don't start smoking at the age of 26, it's 99% chance that they'll never start smoking.
"Even in very small children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says the Federal Health Ministry Tanya Plibersek and quotes a study that showed, for example, that children are joining a crown in order to be princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries consider introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry strongly praised the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation, there are serious inconceivable consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
Fading from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Another claims that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes packages from a silicone service to cover disgusting boxes two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have lost their withdrawals regarding the laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico had sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and was expecting new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As possible, experts indicate the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes in front of direct view, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but it cannot limit foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you are left with only this small space for the promotion of your products, the online space for you is an insurmountable place where you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a research worker in public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman recorded an increase in the rating of social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, performed by "average Honzo".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave himself a job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the sector has focused on how it invests in new regulations rather than on marketing.
The sector has gone so far that it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacks on new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia are trading significantly.
The adoption of the SOO Decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has held talks with other governments that consider similar laws relating to packages.
Canada was the first country to take mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
Now more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine, have expanded.
More stringent laws are being considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the South African Republic and India.

It is not so bad to be bored in the world of uncontaminated connections
The last day of Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting for a half day at the airport for another flight is quite annoying, even through the disbanding of books, magazines and iPhones (not only about duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are getting more and more tired.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And since most of us are constantly attached to a screen today, we do not have a chance to enjoy it.
So should we support boredom?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll be back.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that came with more free time.
But as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History nudy) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, I have a long history of boredom," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, from the first century of our flight.
And then there's also a question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea of the target group about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it."
Nudity differs from apathy because a person is not involved in anything, but she wants to be.
He says there's no need to do anything about the apathy.
He says that the core of nude is "distorting the process of attention associated with a bad mood and a sense of slow running time."
Nudda can remember much of the depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a mutual relationship, people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when we're only having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment where participants listened to a tape on which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they could hardly notice it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV show of silence declared more boring than the other two groups - had problems with concentration, but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or boring task, a distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "what it's like looking for bad parts on the factory line, it can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that bending and snoring, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to go around will learn more and will retain more information than those who are forced to sit down in peace," said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored at times -- the delay of my flight, the humming player, especially a long film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
In order to help measure boredom, scientists in the 80th century developed the "Bordom Proneness Scale" (Bordom Proneness Scale).
The stairs include questions like: "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous," and "I'm so interested that I don't have time to do all of them."
With these steps, scientists have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally invalid.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of the adolescents indicated that they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent indicated that they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he doesn't know if the percentage of the nude would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
He said, however, that he knows that "adjuvanting is the ultimate time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is it boring for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to face absurd physical risks, gambling, or abuse of conventional substances as a way to mitigate them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creation, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Now there's a way to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy for just a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to have fun or drive on his own," said Professor Fenske.
And "this self-control is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child not only learns how to have fun, but gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical of her.
Our goal should be to feel more comfortable when we have reached a continuous breakdown of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulating," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise turns off."
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a high school and a footballer from South Eastern Colorado, faces a charge of criminal acts for something that will soon be legal in the whole state - for holding several grams of marijuana and smoke used for its smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he went with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After a police officer found in a marijuana car, Mr. Orozco was given a call for drug detention and training for drug abuse - a minor offense with a penalty of USD 100 - and a court date was set for him.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the last few weeks after a coloured vote on the legalisation of a small quantity of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends rather on the place than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of violations of marijuana detention have already been brought here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures, has been abolished.
The police department ceased to accuse adults aged 21 and older for holding a small quantity, which will be lawfully allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in the more conservative territories of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing cases of marijuana, and still blame people for detention.
At the same time, several cities from the capital of Denver, towards the western mountains, vote to prevent the opening of new, state licensed shops with marijuana in their villages.
"This matter is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are shaking and the regulators in Washington state.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for growth, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, whether in good or bad, is in front of most states in marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it's going to be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a speech counselor for the licensing of the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than propose what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we can drive," he said.
Washington law, called I-502, has effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal holding yes.
And there are solid mechanical issues that have to be resolved during this period, for example, how to export a State directive on "appropriate approach" to licensed marijuana with its prohibition of trading with a rope up to 330 metres from schools, parks, children's rings or children's centres.
"There will be no more difficulty in placing a licensed trade with a rope than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Centre for Legal Horses, a recently established research group.
On November 21st, police chief Oates from Aurora sent his e-mail to his officials, in which he announced that the city prosecutor would no longer commit crimes for holding a small quantity of marijuana in every citizen aged 21 and that the police "with immediate validity" would stop the charge of the people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would promote city laws governing drug addicts and continue to target drug dealers and dealers.
In the period Weld in North Colorado, the periodic prosecutor Ken Buck is a closer look.
After the vote, he announced that his office would continue in the process of holding marijuana, most of which as a way to press the user to seek treatment.
At present, there are 56 grams or less marijuana indictees of 119 people, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to commit a criminal offence, which was a criminal offence at the time it occurred," said Mr Buck in his statement.
The response was also complicated in places such as the rural Mesa period, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the period, no longer blames adults for holding a small number.
The district prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to refuse all ongoing detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to promote the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the Colourad wishes supported measures, the introduction of recreational marijuana into the government's handbook and the legal system will never be easy.
In view of this large state green experiment, the counterproductive reaction to the state revealed a deep dissatisfaction between local officials.
For periodic prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of holding marijuana, and a local spokesman of the National Organisation for the Reform of marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of their lives reaching people that they still couldn't really accept that it was legal," he said.
As the first states to build small quantities of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national testing cases for drug law.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new frontiers for legalised sales and are also looking forward to the federal government's guidelines, which are still planned to consider sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will fail.
Despite several arrests by marijuana sellers for medical purposes and patients who use it, which have attracted attention, the federal government has left most of the trades with a medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are probably not going to go out the door to catch a small drug bag, it is likely that they will also be able to allow state-regulated trades with recreational marijuana permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser in the area of the anti-drug policy of President Obama.
A number of colorful cities are not waiting for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratorium on any new marijuana business, even if it would take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a half-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we're giving someone a license and then we're going to have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our pledge voted against this addition.
We're looking at what she voted for, against what she voted for.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
In their opinion, today's university students are not the only ones attacked.
I don't remember ever having a study at the University of Oxford.
Like my father, my older brother was studying at the university, which I thought was the world's largest place of knowledge, a modern-day blame for the Greek symposium that motivated two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 20th century, two weeks after going to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed my suitcases, and got into the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I gave it up because I objected to the love of the students in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson said I'd left because I was forced to drink out of my mind.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my kind of bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was followed for one reason and in this collaborator of supposed enlightenment it was both big and barbaric: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was highly appointed adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a proponent of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the latest reports indicate that a new generation of students suffers from a similar follow-up from Wednesday.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students were seeking the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Youth Association (JCR) at Corpus Christis College claim that because of their political views they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are shown not to be welcome".
They call for the creation of a position in the university committee for equal opportunities to ensure that their views can be communicated freely.
Their situation has not even helped the recently mentioned BBC TV documentary Two with the name Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about the student's political act, which the conservative has cured as wonder and neo-Nazi.
The series was presented by Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservation Association (OUCA), who was driving Rolls-Royce, was dressed in silver clothes and had a lead with silver head.
In other high schools, conservative students say that they are treated as "victims".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday reporters that "the impact of life on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
Twenty-one years of history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands ready for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unfriendly", while 90-year-old elected President OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the approach of members of JCR to people from Wednesday, the right has become worse.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I performed in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and in a humiliating way.
The hatred for the Conservative side was the most expensive.
About a year earlier, the university voted against the award of an honorary title by former student Margaret Thatcher for the sake of the cuts in the funding of higher education.
Even Stalinists would be afraid of the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students met with each other and with teachers, I got to taste the chicken that was supposed to come.
I found that not only do the professors of silence approve of the recording of conservative pupils, but they also enjoy participating in it.
In the wood covered by the hearings, a policy of mountain ranges, privatisation and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic was introduced.
My first lecture was about translating the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed was not prepared for me.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please put in the first paragraph."
I'm tired of it.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake cake, was very yellow.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students moved.
I've had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your leisure time, so if you are not too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I got beaten back in my room.
At dinner at school, I sat on my own when I felt a slight stabbing on my shoulder.
He was a second-year-old student named James, who represented himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone who's suspected of conservativeism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but he knows your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most conservatives pretend to be Labourers.
Later in the local house, I tried to pretend.
I was insisting that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A student of the first year of the field of philosophy, politics and economy who (as irony) went to Eton, said: "You are a daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students took notes with him.
I was crazy, dirty.
"How do conservationists love each other?" one asked.
He's beating each other, isn't he?
I felt like they had to feel gay before a liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with similar thinking people only after the harvest?
I'd have to change into a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they developed as a cleansing of ignorance and isolation.
The only open conservative professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history who lived in my college.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being the advisor to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
This place hated for his province and for his attachment to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he went to the place of professor at the Bilkent University of Turkey in Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started coming from Oxford to my parents' house in London, looking for shelter with my unscrupulous metropolitan friends and families.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
All political opinions were accepted during his study at Oxford in the 1940s.
"But it's the best place in the world," said patheticly.
They wouldn't, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His naked eyes were dulled.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative party, was under pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of the course, when another professor of history told me quite seriously that I am "enemies of people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was getting a cold red inside, I confessed to having my "parents brushed my brain" and called them "old lunatics."
The left was only short-lived.
The skull in my Oxford career has stuck my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week to Murdoch's news.
My door was locked.
I was screaming inside, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave it up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dehydrated weak.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poisoning in the educational institution.
More tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers were raised, but which is also hidden to this day as an undeserved reputation of place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has better elegance than glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Natya Abascalova, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the old-fashioned residence of Isabely I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentina Garavaniho exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the start of the famous retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says to his irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il Signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his honored client.
Valentino was always fascinated by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will take place until 3 March, covers private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important cults, from Princess Salima Aga Chán through the Greek princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from a simple Croatian town of Vogher in northern Italy to an icon of the international "bohemic garbage dump".
It's not wrong to like the royal family.
"They don't at least touch you with a bad cigarette in a great cup, as some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemish.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests have a great deal of fun and elegance.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and close friends of forgotten beauty such as Marella Agelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always had more elegance than fame.
And yet there's a star from him."
Valeria Mazzová shows Valentina
The designer's charisma does not forget the Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since we went to him for dinner after a visit to Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us, Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, his decoration, his food, his music, he was enchanted in everything and felt his spirit.
All the calls made him feel important and loving," recalls the top model that began working with him during the Paris Week of Top Fashion in 1995.
"He will never get out of fashion, because his designs are artistic works," he says.
Overview of birthdays
The grave's life is not a story of possession, but of truly reciprocated love.
He loves people with good upbringing and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was built to a special 70-metre long passport that offers an exchange of roles: a visitor changes on the model and walks the passport to observe the "obligence" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces have on himself as dresses that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that she had on herself Monica Vitti in "Night", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba's.
In the audience the manikinek is known as Sibilla Lucemburská, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norská, Rosario Bulharská or Sophie Habsburská.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "not to forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests "gillette" and jacket from the winter-winter collection from 1971 to 1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers.
"I give him in front of others the privilege of his womanhood and great love for women, because he inspires our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
"I like the colors that they use, they explain a lot, and they give the "light" face.
Proportions are perfect."
No princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how Valentina first dressed herself.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be full - age and have an opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
She finally reached the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentina for the occasion of a celebration at the palace of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
They were red dresses that had skirts with calls, tied lives and tops without shoulders.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow after Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax for fashion, his passion is overtime," explains an Italian aristocrat whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored designer dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just dress, it's also a file of memories they have in them."
"King" Mode
The golden tomb of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
In order to create these silk jackets of ivory color with all the pearls, twelve types of different corners and pull four and a half meters long, it took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as called the designer of his dress).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized printing press, these dresses represent the top fashion border at the end of the 20th century, "return customers from high company".
Valentino, who was crowned the elite "savor-être" over the years, is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Order of Honorary Legion gathers as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always attracted his choice, peace, adjusted and perfect view," says Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at the gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my big friend.
He was inconvenient, time on him left no trace."
When the princess says...
The strongest handle in the world: cheese carriers in the area of Kawah Ijen
In four euros, they gamblers in the area of Indonesian soup with their lives and health, carrying 70 pounds [70 kg] of cheese down the steep stone trails.
They're people whose work is hell, and they're the ones who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by obtaining cheese from Kawah Ien soup on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, every day the farate to the bottom of the crater, where raw gases are avoided from the inside of the Earth, and when contacting the air, it passes into a stable state.
After cutting large blocks of cheese, which together weighs up to 70 pounds, it refers to the shoulder in two bamboo baskets along top stone paths.
At the top of the soup, which is only 250 metres, it takes more than 40 minutes for the worn-out carriers to rise at a speed of 386 meters, because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so that they do not slip and fall into ruin.
They know that any confusion could lead to a life like that of a French tourist who was born on the Kawah Ijen scale years ago.
Mountainers in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of cheese that they earn
When they are up, they take a trip around tourists who photograph them as being monkeys in the circus, and they tirelessly refer heavy baskets to the vase that the target company placed about something below 1850 meters above sea level.
It is a company of PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been in the soup since 1960 and has never paid more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of cheese to its employees.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry because this disorder has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even white sugar.
"Because it usually weighs 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) each way," explains Anto, who usually graduates three trips daily.
One journey takes him three hours and eventually it is destroyed, but it can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even if it appears to be a negligible amount for such a non-indigenous effort, it's a threefold sum of what he would make in the field.
"The daily wage of the miners is very high here. For example, the collection of coffee is worth 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day and the payment for fourteen days is two million rupees (167)," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a farmer.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees per day and his work was not so hard, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the trunk, for a serious reason which is as convincing in Indonesia as cheese: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
And he's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are poisoned by toxic gases.
In his 27 years Anto three times a day he risks life in Kawah Ijen’s soup, whose cheese has already begun to choose his tax, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are poisoned by toxic gases that avoid the soup.
That's the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I will work for two more years, because I want to open my shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than the existing English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man who comes to judgment could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at the hotel, and instead does the work of the carrier.
It shares a dirty wooden chat with other carriers and every day rises in two hours in the morning, because the cheese at night does not cease to grow and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September darkness.
Even through the surrounding darkness, Anto leads to the crater and brightens his path a little light that he has attached to his helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 bearers carry on a shoulder basket with cheese from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high income, the demand for cheese for cost savings has not mechanized, nor does it provide for carriers working on their own pets and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, they do not even receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photographing supplement, which together with an entrance for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) select the observers of the natural park from tourists who come to take pictures of the soup and its human flies.
"This work is for profit, not for people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old civil carrier who has been working in Kawah Ien for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 pounds and assures us that he will continue to work "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons between 18 and 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retirement, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life.
Although the cheese burns the throat and sticks in the eyes, when the wind turns unexpectedly and catches the horn in thick tails that come out of the trunks, the climbers are so insistent that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... it is obvious, however, from their frequent respiratory difficulties, arthritis, knee pain and wound caused by the shoulder of the thighs.
The Uinik, who weighs his basket on his back, can load only 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his colleagues remove the cheese in 15 tons of soup, which then the three trucks take off the steep road between the houses in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life," says Unainik and opens up a wide mouth where several teeth are missing.
His five sons are the oldest, 30 years of age, and he also earns a drop of cheese.
The time of the gas, but the constant pace of one of the most difficult tradesmen in the world lasts from generation to generation - trades that perform human mills in Kawah Ileen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
The Singaporeans argue that they have no children, no career, no stress and no cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm the owner, you're my wife and you're the owner.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of advertising on menthol beans, but - or perhaps just because - the video started this year in Singapore has spread massively on YouTube.
These words are part of the rap that uses the local "we give the bough to the horn" as a smile of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, who created the video, hopes that they will be able to point to this advertising in a funny way.
The artistic director of the Douglas Hamilton agency says he wanted to use the influence of music in order for people to fulfil their "civil duty".
"It was about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we should have felt it's the subject we need to touch.
We knew that the government was trying a lot of things to expand perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not quite functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, such as the composition of rape, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it too seriously is a Singaporen government.
He spends $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends parental leave and grants financial contributions.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservative of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to population classification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Lastly, it exceeded the fertility rate of 2, which is considered to be the rate of renewal, in 1976.
Why do the Singaporeans not have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Committee on Marriage and the Family of the National Population Office, says it is because of "better education" and "wider scale of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of options, with regard to life's goals and priorities, it's not just marriage and family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and child rearing. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there has been a drastic effort in the framework of immigration policy to increase the rate of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of people, this has led to inviolability among locals.
On some Singapore’s websites, there is unsolicited xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s government recorded its worst election result from the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, efforts were made to resolve the problem by means of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unforeseen Effects
While the decrease in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health and immigration spending, in the case of Singapore, there have also been some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to keep so many small houses from falling apart.
For example, she began to influence real estate trade.
The City Development Office has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "bot boxes", which can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have a area of 46 square meters and have great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support the youthful lifestyle and reflect the development of large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the development company EL Developers, claims that their "Bot Boxes" are sold far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and they're selling for days to weeks faster than houses with a larger range.
That's why our money is so much better."
However, it would admit that the new standards provide clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the birth rate of the nation, the talks with Singaporeians working in the financial quarter in the centre of the city indicate that they will not have much effect.
"People are still under stress, homes are expensive, as well as education, so many people are putting off," says a young official.
"The others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women also refer to careers, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, it's also the Singaporeans who have the last word about the family's establishment.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to the dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about something that has a personal character or "the area of private life which has every right to protect against any violation".
What is privacy for a person under 16 years of age?
How does this definition apply in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet things that he would certainly not tell anyone during regular communication?
Newspapers from ElPeriodico spoke to five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "something entirely own" in the personal level and as "user's name and password", if it was a social network.
"My biggest secret I wouldn't disclose," says ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I'm giving the FB nice pictures or pictures of how we play.
I'm also talking to my acquaintances.
I wouldn't share a picture that wouldn't be mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscenity photos, photos of naked persons or pictures of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on the FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
There's a mother among them who has a name and a password from one of the accounts.
"I set up a Twitter account so that I could express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone's gonna answer me, I'm just giving them up there," she adds.
"The social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or fast communicating with friends," she says.
Without weighing, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even be interested in recommending someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teen own accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and on the last mentioned network will admit that he doesn't know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them put him on anything, nor did he want an address or phone number after him.
"If they insisted on me or demanded it from me, it would be easy to remove it from their account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading his recommendation on Twitter.
Tomuto boys are not foreign experiences with what is today called cyberbulying.
"The famous friends on the social network have been blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't give up the account.
"She just activated her private regime."
Then she explains a series of steps to set the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of people known in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would have done it if someone had offended me or just wanted me to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate of Výchýv and education, believes that children and adolescents in social networks need to understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform them.
He says: "The Internet was created as a means to find information, but when a social network appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Movers, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who need to be taught, and then we are only learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them to know what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at the age when they are not mature enough to do so."
Also, to be - as far as the environment is concerned - balanced, at the time when it is most desirable to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not to think about consequences," he adds.
According to this expert, it is the most effective way for children and adolescents to show what is private, asking questions that they need to think about.
"Tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
Moreover, Marrielos Porras names some of the options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this online?
Or: Would you like someone to publish your photo the way you published your friend?
You know what the others say about you?
When you're marking people on the party photos, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more: Does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet just as much as outside it.
It's the same rules.
"A person is guided by respect, moral and other principles outside the internet and should be on social networks," he says.
Overview
Esturdo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher at first level and an education counselor explains that it is necessary for parents of children to read the rules on social networks carefully.
"If they understand each person's background, they have a good basis for talking to the children about the consequences that the online account may have.
For example, about age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
The Guard is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule "not to talk to strangers".
The summit of South America ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth Presidency of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without the issue of a Lima Declaration, which was revised and which was reportedly signed by the seven current presidents.
The Efé Agency has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur organisation, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who have initially established that the document will be published after the summit, have stated that it will be published later on the Peruvian government's website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanto Humalu in a number of short press statements.
The journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the discussion, a video from the Presidential Assembly was broadcast in the press room without a sound with a report "confidential session, audio transmission banned".
A small amount of information that journalists had available was provided by press speakers of some governments who were present rather than by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the discussion was a list of participants with the presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from different national and international media to be reluctant to ask for more information.
Later, the Peruvian president's office sent an e-mail with a "final declaration" from the summit, but it was just about President Humaly's statement, not about the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru's third summit of South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Países Arabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion, the Declaration of Lima was not originally announced, although it was demanded by the press.
The official pages of ASPA can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists were sent, but they completely blocked the pressure of information.
The summit concluded, inter alia, with Chile and Peru's joint commitment to the decision of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
President of Peru Olanta Humala and President Chile Sebastian Pinier met at the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday with the hearing of both sides in the defence debate, which started the dispute against Lima against Santiag.
"We will take action and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing at this international court today," said President Humala with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Piñar added and greeted President Humal with a grip on the trains of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that the International Court of Justice decision is being dealt with was published after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing the details of the judgements of the International Court of Justice, which decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be totally wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Roseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the Unasur organisation in 2011 after President Fernanda Luga was then summoned and the meeting was not attended.
Hostal President Ollanta Humala was entrusted with the opening of early speeches and the signing of the summit in Lima shortly after the afternoon.
The President read a final document informing him that 16 agreements were adopted and that 31 projects were planned between the South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, the member countries of the UNASUR organisation will take "significant steps towards a goal in the form of a South American citizen for which residence agreements are extended".
He reported that actions are supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil and international organised crime, to improve access to drugs and the cheap internet in all parts of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "there is no economic consolidation (Latin America), but it should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between various South Americas, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian President said in a speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and its coastal areas, and the other two concern a better connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also covered the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its return to the Union of South American nations," which is currently excluded.
Another issue raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is a celebratory and good neighbourly relationship.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped that on Saturday in Mexico he would meet with his Nicaraguan protégé Daniel Ortego to discuss with respect the judgement of the International Court of Justice regarding the maritime border dispute, which is challenged by the Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortego on Saturday," Santos said.
"We are discussing all the solutions, none are excluded, not a deal with Nicaragua, which would require a deal with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortega that we will conduct the most civilized and inconceivable conversation," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they will participate in the inauguration of the Dark President Enrique Peña Nety.
In the framework of the summit, the EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the field of defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last countries mentioned are currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which "the South America must really learn from Europe in this case".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Peru that Europeans were "killed for World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one nation".
In this sense, the project to create a South American citizen supported by the Member States of the Unasur organisation has been hampered.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place between members of the Andean community must be achieved, however, there are still areas of return which want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
The President of Ecuador, among other things, expressed his agreement with the regrouping of the United States Organization (OAS), provided that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States would be reduced and those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights would be taken into account.
"Those in charge are never committed to anything, and we the South American will sign it all.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," stated the statement in opposition to political asylum provided by the Ecuadorian founder, WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not respect this decision because he did not break his principles and respected his 'deep democratic values and human rights'.
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticised the Swedish court, who asked it to be heard in the Swedish territory for alleged sexual delinquency, while "own Swedish legislation allows for a videoconferencing hearing that could be conducted from the equatorial embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since our embassy, but the embassy informed me that he had minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But he threatens that his physical and mental condition is worse because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the resolution of asylum granted to Assange since June at the equatorial embassy in London on the basis of permits that enables him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks had been held with London with a view to resolving the detention of founder WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is leading a series of proceedings at various European courts," he said.
He stated that "if the Great Britain leaves tomorrow, everything will end."
And if Sweden listens to Mr. Assange at the equatorial embassy in London or through Skype, how without a problem it enables there legislation and how it has been done in other cases, this problem will be brought to an end tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and explained that he certainly did not tolerate "understanding, wrong intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, according to and repudiate politics, but bad journalists in profit, pressure and blackmail services," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy at the fact that neither reporters, "no bankers, no hegemonic country nor bourgeoisie do not control Ecuador", and suggested that if he was elected again, "he will continue in the changes led by the right path and direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership in the Union of Unasur at least in its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and intolerance of opportunism and puhisism committed to legality", because in fact "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he considered the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time following the judgement of the International Court of The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to dance together.
It is necessary to assess the scope to be overcome and it was an opportunity to move forward."
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the maritime border dispute, which is settled at the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is appropriate for Latin America to seek international authorities if both countries undertake to take a judgment whatever the case may be".
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in the third mandate, he noted that he noticed this option "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa announced that if in February 2013 the election loses, she will leave public life.
"I have never personally been interested in the power, but the unfair situation, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, it's the same with me.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Madur, who says that President Chávez went to scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
There is no recovery in the President's health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State today participated in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), which was set up by calls for greater regional integration with a view to maintaining development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a flash hit me," he says in memory of the moment of truth that the doctor was trying to "a little calm", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it secret in front of his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and start to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several diseases.
Fabrizio has been living with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little treatment options and a greater stigma.
At that time, neither the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) clinic, "because he had a severe wound".
Then having AIDS was a synonym for death.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and live with it.
However, there are many people who do not know and come to know about their disease until the virus has caused the body to disappear and sent out an immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the outbreak of AIDS in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "means a great success that the length of life of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is quite the same as for healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, who confirmed this information in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and life expectancy depends on the degree of disability in the immune system of patients diagnosed with disease, and are better on those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells may live for up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells for 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the person diagnosed with HIV in 25 years can, according to these findings, "by living without problems until 75 years", explained the doctor in the interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is worth noting that the average life span of Mexicans is 76 years today.
Although death has declined significantly in recent years and in Mexico has decreased the number of people who died of AIDS, from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS anniversary), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died since the outbreak of AIDS according to national statistics.
In 2011 only 255 people died in Jalisco, and by May 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
- Why do people still die from the consequences of the disease?
- "I don't think the problem is in the way of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens at our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the stocks of medicines. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of the disease, or at a later stage of the disease."
It adds convincing data: "9 out of ten patients are coming when there is an associated infection. The only thing we need to do to be more able to affect overall mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and therefore it is necessary to offer to a large extent tests to detect the disease to all those who ask for it."
In its proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco state and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to make tests in a private laboratory only because he had done so by his friend, and even through his low age, he had already contracted the AIDS disease and also suffered Kaposi’s sarcoma, an infectious disease, which is one of the common complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm supposed to die now, I'd rather go three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy food, exercise, taking medication."
To this day, his parents know only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsiblely, I pay attention to myself and to another person," says Fabrizio, who has taken the challenge of sharing his experience with MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid of AIDS today.
"Let them do tests. If they risked, so that they know first if they are HIV positive, it's better, and if they've been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message sets out the password of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the desktop
Between health programs and ordinary citizens there is a great loss, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajar journalist who finds information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that devote themselves to this task, "the distribution of condoms has really increased, we were given one or two before, today we are given packages and hundreds of condoms, which are very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most prone to new diseases are teenagers.
"What do you want?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, medical staff and medical staff who want to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He suggested that this ineffective distribution be changed, so that condoms are not only behind the counters, but that hundreds be found in the public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It's not promiscuity support.
Nor is it "paying beer and motel" to them, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree with the division of condoms in his period.
It is not sexuality. It is best to access condoms to those who are already leading sexual lives," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco State
There were 13 435 cases (12 158 AIDS cases and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This condition in Mexico represents the fourth place in new and detected AIDS cases and 13 places in relation to HIV.
92% of the disease is sexually transmitted, 6% of the bloodstream and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who do not know about the disease in one registered case.
The judgment approved by the Court of Justice of the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of Group Vitro’s debt in Mexico, calls for a bad precedent for any national enterprise with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It appears, then, that the restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of pipes and stars in spite of international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Halem at the North Texas Competition Court leaves in practice a Mexican firm without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexican producer of glass door to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against three inequalities.
It should be said that while the judge of this case claims that the creditors are to be governed by an insolvency law of the United States, the Court of Justice of the Fifth Period, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are a competition procedure in Mexico.
First, it would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
For this purpose, a United Nations model law for the unification of international trade law was established, which is determined by the American Law Institute by the arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without voting the branches of the internal business structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro towards branches is recognised, the required majority would not be achieved to approve the restructuring.
However, this option is permitted by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's case was not the first one in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples here, such as Agrex and Commercial Mexican, for which the Federal Competition Institute has held an intruder's debt.
In addition, it is true that even after the vote of the branch, believers - who against Vitro stood before the court in the United States, i.e. the funds of the "supply" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent by 37.
This information shall not be taken into account by the court of appeal.
From a different perspective, Vitro’s court is guilty of a difficult situation that has been facing since 2008 - in the background of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, González Sady, the family, will appeal for a new assessment directly at the court of appeal, so that the assessment will take place for full participation, i.e. for the participation of five judges, because they initially voted only three.
If it fails here, it will be required as a remedy for the revision of the higher court process, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is serious that the Court referred to a document sent by the Mexican Government as a service of friendly curiae, in which the Vitro procedure is described in detail under the Competition Act, and indicating that the company has facilitated itself by agreeing to agreements signed between the two countries in order to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Law.
Moreover, it points out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, this is the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Attack on both sides: punishment for Vitro and state.
Overall evaluation
Without noting the table, the criminal notice of the Mexican Air Force committees against the former owner of Gaston Azcarrag Andrade, who was ordered from the subversive proceedings, and according to the board of pilots, has already survived.
The authorities in charge of Carlos Díaz Chavez Morineau just filed a complaint against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accused of obstructing the achievement of justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this undertaking, in which it selected 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexico Air Force F/589 from Bank IXE.
The media were probably directed to buy shares Professional Hotel Management (Administrator Professional de Hotels).
As we know, Azcarrag Andrade is a majority shareholder of Posadas hotels.
Dragon Martu siege
In the Universidad de Caribe area, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of a association met on the weekend in order to prevent the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge shopping and distribution centre with products from "a country with large walls" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for workers from 150 companies in the lower part.
The Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industriala de Transformación) has previously managed to unite the governors of the southeast area to stand against the monumental area, which would in part destroy protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of question with ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which the government did not take into account and which required an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed a Trade Agreement against counterfeiting, known under the English short ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Méxicano de la Propidad Industrial).
As we know, it has happened so despite the fact that the senate itself excluded the possibility to consider it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "The basketball was my life"
The basketball runner Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been involved with this saloon sport for more than 60 years and has been processing the whole world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have memories of the history of local basketball, such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before he was supported by his brain death in 2008 on a wheelchair, burned to this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a national basketball league BSN player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or the President of the Puerto Rican basketball federation.
"I stood up for a lot of role during my life in basketball, including several at the same time as when I was president of the BSN National League, general manager of the national team and president of the federation," Reyes reminded reporters of Primer Hor at home in Bayamón, where he has been living for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketbal was my life."
Reyes in his claim of failure.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and monuments from his long careers, testify.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the highest of all the guards, those who remember his actions in Los Vaqueros since the 1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"It was my best summer, the one I used most because I had the opportunity to participate with the team Los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as the owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one of the champions - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy was in the BSN.
Then the team took over the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was a former coach here and who was acting at the Alabama University in Birmingham at that time, said to me, "I have an adult two-foot player for you.
Do you want it?"
And it was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then advised me that Raymond Gausse's players, who became a team member and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon to the championship, Gauss will contribute to another."
The champion, when the Los Vaqueros team played Gauss, enjoyed himself, but was far away because in 1988 he had already served as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and to take advantage of Mincy's position on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic game in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world's championship in 1990, where we ended the fourth, but we should have the bronze not to be the Canadian judge who let us repeat the final introduction," Reyes said.
Is the world's greatest national team you've ever seen in 1990?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Panameris Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we blew up the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that broke our bronze on the world championship.
It was not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quiyote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
A man who may not have had the perfect composition, but who managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a man of the Olympic qualifications in 1995 in the Argentine Neukén.
With match players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitner, who replaced the players who were excluded because of the competition in the Panamanian games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rica's best player?
It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rica has reached this level of results such as Piculin.
Don't talk about his actions in different leagues where he was playing.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's job very much from young people.
Which success in the federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous age of national manhood in 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s, the national league had BSN in one season to 17 men.
What couldn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a distribution of youth categories by regions.
For example, Ponce boys would play only in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-offs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits of mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, decision-makers and decision-makers.
It's a pleasure.
What are you dedicated to now?
The most I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course I'm using my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, world-renowned John Ross Ewing's main role, known as "J.R." in the Dallas TV series, where he was a man who acted independently and was aggressive and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the precious oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the Dallas TV series, became a symbol of famine in the '80s, he died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died, according to the official announcement of the family, which the Associated Press provided to the production company Dallas Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon to complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved home town of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved the most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in the Dutch hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane announced.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was made, beautiful, fun, nice, kind and talented, and I'm going to miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life full," Linda Gray said in her announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver, and Hagman underwent transplantation.
Years before the television show Dallas, Hagman celebrated himself as a decent man in a remote comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets the attractive girl (Gina), who plays Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were broadcast only briefly, and this was The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His effectiveness in films included the roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was at Hangman's master's performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star peak.
The drama series CBS on the Ewings clan and other personalities around them was released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jajar?", which was to trigger expectations about the work of full emotion when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of viewers worldwide, but also the risk of millions of dollars in stock offices.
It also helped to reach a record in monitoring.
November 1980, in which the answer was revealed, followed 41 million TV viewers. Dallas became the second most popular series of history after the end of the 1983 MASH series, which followed 50 million viewers.
On J.R., his mother-in-law, Kristin, was shot by Mary Crosby.
Kristin and J.R. were pregnant and then threatened to label her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
The Hagman played Ewing, an ignorant chamois with charismatic smile: a treacherous businessman and an unfaithful husband who was trying to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in the hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
There should be: "There's an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled on Friday the Hagman as someone who was "big for the wages and beyond him".
It is unforgettable and irretrievable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who should have known and loved him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series sent the TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"The film of five parts of the second row and the sixth has just been completed," the TV station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, no announcements were available from Warner or TNT station about how the series will continue.
A family from Fort Worth in Texas was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who was fascinated by classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, Lawyer Ben Hagman.
By the early 1950 ’ s, Larry had tried to make himself happy at the New York theatre stage and then served in England from 1952 to 1956 at the airport.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelson, who married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where they lived a lot of celebrities.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't do anything there that I knew could harm or harm someone," said Press Association Agency.
After liver transplantation, he began to devote himself to organ donation promotion and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped the fighting patients.
"I do them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of, "Don't worry, it'll be a bit unpleasant for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that examines "the end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course about the end of the world, he knew that it was an inexhaustible tool: the end of the "long number" of May's calendar, which is due to arrive on 21 December, came to many people as evidence that the end of the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what was waiting for him in the next few months: Catastrophe Hurricane Sandy, a budget failure that some call the "decent Armageddon", and a growing conflict in which Israel is confined, where Christians who theorize about the end of the world will begin.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most impenetrable semester he ever was," Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden in New Jersey this week.
When you figure out what's going on in the world today, like we've had 30 days left, it's really a good time.
And remember that bad means for apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only professor offering courses about the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Barry Vacker is an expert assistant in the course of "Middles, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students study apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We choose why these ideas are expanding over time," she says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, the war can break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from real life examples.
"I tried to inform the students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," says Vucker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restal and his colleague Amara Solari, a professional assistant in art history and anthropology were given to organize a course with a simple name of the end of the world.
"We don't connect "2012," because we're always counting on the possibility of reorganizing the course if the world doesn't end," said Restal.
Even through "dangerous disappearance", students must study, design projects and perform final tests.
On Penn State, the final test will take place in the evening of the Apocalypse, which does not give students a different chance than to work "until the evening of the predicted end of the world," said Restal.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He grew up in two hours," said Restall about his high-average student course, which was registered as 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received an e-mail question as to whether it was still in place.
The students themselves make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to please themselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden, 23-year-old Bridged Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
And then apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thought is just a question of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalypse films.
"I've never heard of an hour when it could be taught," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no spoken student, but the professor, did not say he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project discussed the Maya prediction and we're going to throw it out in a certain way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last year at the Temple University of West Chester.
"May's never foretold the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restal.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that spans several centuries back, which people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The development of these speculations caused the Internet.
"People don't think about it elsewhere," he said.
This is what happens in the absolute majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about any course on "the end of the world," he answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote and pointed out an exception to the Supreme Authority.
We have the Pope's love.
The restaurant noted that over the years it was about many days of the final court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start to think about the next date immediately" or to think that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period on which the world will disappear.
The date is taken at a slight weight by students and professors.
Several told them they were going to celebrate the end of the world.
"I'll call a few friends to laugh together," explained a 20-year-old student of Samir Ford communication.
