"Installing monitoring in a determined manner would show animal workers that their well-being is the highest priority."
The International Earthquake Map of the US Research Agency USGS did not record any Earthquake in Iceland last week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office has shown that there have been no earthquakes in the Hekla region in the last 48 hours.
The significant seismic activity resulting from the change in the phase was recorded on 10 March on the north-east side of the highest volcano caldera.
There were dark clouds in the mountains that did not result from any volcanic activity.
The clouds could have made it difficult to recognize if it actually came to an eruption.
Luno transported between 120 and 160 metres of six - fuel when the crash occurred and the strong wind blowing in conjunction with the waves pushed him to the phalogron.
Helicopters rescued twelve crew members; the only damage to the nose was broken.

China has developed a market economy in the last 30 years, although the official Communist regime has not undergone transformation.
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were implemented.
Since then, the Chinese economy has grown 90 times.
Last year China first exported more cars than Germany, racing the United States as the largest market in this industry.
During two decades of GDP China may exceed GDP in the United States.
The tropical cyclone Danielle, the fourth known as the Hurricane season in the Atlantic in 2010, was formed in the eastern Atlantic.
The driving storm is about 3,000 miles away from Miami in Florida, reaching maximum wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists from the Hurricane National Center predict that Danielle will be forced into force and become a hurricane.
Because the storm is far from the earth, the assessment of its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean is difficult.
Bobek, who came to the world in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, became famous because of the game at Partizan Belgrade Club.
He was with them from 1945 to 1958.

Luckily, I didn't get hurt, but I don't forget this macabrian scene when people tried to knock out the window to get out.
The people rolled in the chairs, but the windows were made of non-slip glass.
"One of the speeds at the end of the break, so people started going out the window," said Francisk Kowal.
The stars emit light and heat, using the energy generated in the process of connecting (or sinking) hydrogen atoms to form heavier particles.
Scientists are trying to create a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, the solution to this problem is a lot of difficulties and years have passed before a useful thermonuclear reactor can be constructed.
The steel mirror floats on the surface of the water due to the tension on the surface.
Surface voltage occurs because water particles on its surface attract more than water particles and air over them.
Objects such as needle can be placed on the water table by the invisible coating that particles create on the surface of the water.
The modern bed has two edges separated by a barbed wire, and two edges increase the attachment to the ship even when they are placed under the angle.
The tail of the blade is somewhat obliterated, so when the blade turns to one side, the back of the ice is also twisted.
This makes the liar turn, and when the liars turn to the right, the liar turns to the right, and if the liars turn to the left, the liar turns to the left.
To return to an earlier level of energy, they must remove the additional energy from the light.
They're doing this through a little piece of light called a photo.
This process is defined by scientists as "stimulated radiation emissions", because atoms are stimulated by clear light, causing light photon emissions, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next image shows atoms that emit photons. Of course, photons are much smaller than on this picture.
Photos are even smaller than particles that form atoms!
Hundreds of hours of work cause the lamp in the lamp to finally turn off and the lamp ceases to shine.
Then there is a need to exchange the lamp. Caution should be exercised when exchanging the lamp.
First, switch off the light or switch off the cable.
This is because the current affecting the repair where the metal part of the lamp is located can seriously defeat the internal repair or metal base of the lamp when it is partly in the process.
The primary organ in the circulation system is the heart, pumping blood.
The blood is derived from the heart of the "directors", which are called the arteries, and the "directors" called the veins". The term of the haired act refers to the smallest of these "directors".
The teeth of the triratops could not only crush the leaves, but also extraordinarily hard branches and roots.
According to some scholars, triratops were fed by sows, that is, typical plants for the credit period.
This plant reminds us of a small palm with a crown created by the sharp, slender leaf.
The strong pasta could be useful for triratops when he wanted to take the list before he went to eat the tires.
Other scientists say that these plants are very expensive, so it is not possible for dinosaurs to eat them, even though today weeders and other animals, such as parrots (breeds of dinosaurs) can eat chewing leaves or fruit.
How would the gravitational force work on me on the moon Io? Standing on the surface Io, man weighs less than on the Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the moon Io. The gravity force is there, of course, much smaller.
The sun has no shell like the Earth on which you can stand. The sun is full of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas separates itself to the extent that it separates itself from the sun.
The outer ring that we see, looking at the Sun, is called a photosphere, which literally means "the sphere of light".
The Venus phase, similar to the moon phase, observed some three thousand years later (in 1610) Galileo, using a telescope for this purpose.
The phases result from the fact that the light reaches only to one side of Venus (or the moon), the one that is reversed to the Sun. Copernicus theory, according to which the planets orbit around the Sun, had its confirmation in the phases of Venus.
Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, observed Venus transit a few years later, exactly in 1639.
After the shooting of Danelaw England, she experienced a long period of peace.
However, in 991 Ethelred had to face the Viking fleet, with which only the Guthrum fleet could amount to a hundred years ago.

Hangul is the only specially invented alphabet that is in everyday use. It was invented in 1444 for the reign of King Sejong (1418–1450).
King Sejong has sat on the throne as the fourth ruler of the Joseon dynasty, and to this day enjoys great recognition.
At the beginning, he will define the Hangul alphabet as Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "normal sounds to teach people".
As Sanskrit was born, many theories were formulated, and one of them spoke of the migration of Aryans, who brought their language from the west to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language which is considered to be the eastern equivalent of the European Latin.
The first known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the development of the panacea, Sanskrit simply lost its meaning because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a particularly complex and rich language from which many of the modern languages used in India are derived, just as Latin is a source of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
After the winning French campaign, Germany moved with preparations for an invasion in the United Kingdom.
The Germans called the "Operation of Lew Morski". Most of the heavy weapons and resources of the British army were lost at the time of Dunkierka's abandonment, so the army was weak enough.
Despite all this, the British Navy still exceeded the German Navy (Krygsmarine) and was able to defeat any enemy fleet that would affect the La Manche Canal.
A number of British Navy ships were on potential invasion routes, as the Admirals feared being drowned by the German air raids.
Let us start with an explanation of the plans for Italy. Italy was primarily the "younger brother" of Germany and Japan.
Their army and the Navy were weaker, although just before the war began, they built four new ships.
The main aims of Italy were African countries. To take them, they needed start-up platforms for the military to pass them through the Mediterranean and to attack Africa.
To do so, they had to eliminate British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides, the Italian warships had no other tasks.
And now it's time for Japan, Japan was an island country, just like the United Kingdom.
Ships are submersible floating units designed for longer voyages under the water surface.
The submarines were used during World War I and II, and they were very slow and had limited range of shootings.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but along with the development and greater accuracy of the submarine radar, they were forced to go under the water to avoid discovery.
The German submarines were called U-bots. The Germans were perfectly equipped with navigation and service of submarines.
The Germans were successful in using submarines and therefore, as a result of the war, they did not want to have too much of them.
Yes! King Tutenchamon, sometimes called "King Tut" or "King boy", is one of the most well-known kings of ancient Egypt.
Interestingly, in ancient times it was not considered to be important, it was not taken into account in most ancient writings.
However, when his tomb was discovered in 1922, he became famous, and although many of the ancient tombs fell victim to the robbers, the tomb was actually unrecognizable.
Most of the objects buried together with Tutenchamon were well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious and rare metals.
As a result of the discovery of the rounds, the Assyrian miners were lighter, faster and more effective in the race for warriors and other miners.
More than 1,000 B.C.E., the Assyrians entered the first cavalry.
Kavaleria is a military formation composed of armed riders of horses. The seat has not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry have put their horses on armor.

Sofokles and Aristofanes are still popular playwrights whose art is seen among the largest works in the world literature.
Another famous Greek is Pythagoras, a mathematician, known above all for his famous statement of the relationship of sides in rectangular triangles.
There are different calculations about the number of people using the Hindi language. It is estimated that it is between the two and the fourth most commonly used language in the world.
Taking into account or excluding closely related dialects affects the determination of the total number of native users in the given language.
According to estimates, this language is used from 340 million to 500 million people, and up to 800 million are able to understand it.
In the Hindu and Urdu languages, vocabulary is similar, but different letters; in daily communication, users of both languages can usually understand.
Sometime in the 15th century, northern Estonia was under a very great cultural influence by Germany.
Some of the German monks wanted to approach the God of the local people, so they invented a literal Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet, but one sign was added: Õ/õ.
With the passing of time, many words borrowed from Germany were connected, which was the beginning of enlightenment.

Turkey has access to the sea from three sides: from the west to the Aegean Sea, from the north to the Black Sea and from the south to the Mediterranean Sea.
Luxembourg has a long history, but independence gained in 1839.
Today, parts of Belgium belonged to the past in Luxembourg, but they became the property of Belgium after the Belgian revolution of the 1930s.
Although Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, it has not avoided German occupation during the first and second world wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg joined an organisation known today as the European Union as a Member State and founder.
Drukgyal Dzong is the ruins of the fortress and Buddhist cluster in the upper part of Paro District (in the village of Phondey).
Similarly in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built a fortress to honour his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
After the fire of 1951, only a few relics of Drukgyal Dzonga, e.g. Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, remained.
After the fire, the fortress has been subjected to conservation and protective activities and to this day is one of the most impressive attractions in Bhutan.

Learning to create interactive media requires standard and traditional skills and tools known during interactive activities (the creation of scenarios, the editing of films and audio recordings, history stories, etc.).
In order to design interactively, it is necessary to reassess media production assumptions and to learn to think nonlinearly.
The interactive elements in the project must be connected, but they must also make sense as a separate whole.
The problem with the variable target is that the complexity and number of elements needed to achieve a certain range of fire distances are much greater than in the fixed target.
This is a growing problem, as the production of soybean producers achieve increasingly higher standards in their production.
As a result, variable objects can take pictures of a quality comparable to that obtained by permanent fire targets.
Another minus variable targets is the fact that the maximum width (speed) of the target is significantly smaller.
Therefore, cheaper variable targets make it difficult for poor lighting if the lamp is not used.
One of the most common problems when converting a movie to a DVD format is to adjust the image size.
The overall satisfaction of customers is a key criterion in the production of most televisions.
That's why everything that appears on the TV screen had cut edges down, at the top and on the sides.
This will ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This function is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD its cover is likely to also be cut, and if the tapes are too close down, they will not be fully displayed.
Tournaments, banquets and knights of the Round Table have long been elements of imagination inspired by the traditional theme of the medieval castle.
Even standing in the midst of thousands of years of ruins, sounds and smells of ancient battles can be easily called and practically heard a piece of copiers on the ground, as well as feeling tired of fears.
But is this reality a builder of our imagination? Why did they even start building locks? How were they designed and constructed?
The standard for this period Kirby Muxloe castle is a more sophisticated house than a real castle.
Large glass windows and shade walls would not be able to withstand a strong attack for too long.
In the 1980s, when Lord Hastings began his building, the country was relatively peaceful, only needed defense against small groups of water fighters.
The balance of forces was a system in which the European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all countries in Europe.
In line with this concept, all European nations had to overcome one nation's entry into power, and that is why governments have often changed their allies to maintain international balance.
The first armed conflict, whose rate was equal force, is a war on Spanish success.

The Church of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E. as a result of the fire of Herostratus.
The story tells that he was seeking fame at all costs. The angry Ephesians said that Herostrates' name should be wiped out of human memory.
The Greek historian Strabon then wrote the name, as we know today. The church was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander offered as king that he would cover the cost of rebuilding the temple, but they rejected his offer. Later, after Alexander’s death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.

The civilization of the Indus Valley existed in the Bronze Age in the north-west part of the Indian subcontinent, covering most of today's Pakistan, as well as part of the regions in the north-west Indians and north-west Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the rivers of the Indus River, from which its name originated.
Although they are scholars who assume that since this civilization existed in the river of the famous Saraswati River today, it can also be called the Indus-Saraswati Civilization, while other researchers use the name "Harappian Civilization", referring to Harappa, the first settlement discovered in the 20th century.
The military character of the Roman Empire has contributed to progress in medicine.
The first medical recruitment was initiated by Caesar August and resulted in the first Roman medical corps to serve soldiers wounded in battle.
The surgeons knew a variety of reassuring measures, including morphine obtained on the basis of extracts from the seeds of the poppy and skopolamine from the seeds of the black bear.
They used amputation to protect patients from gangrene, as well as in the use of pressure valves and blood clots to inhibit blood flow.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved a great deal in the field of medicine and has influenced the knowledge we have today.
Origami of Pureland is that only one stroke is allowed at one time, it is not allowed to swallow the stuffed, e.g. swallowing and swallowing, as well as all swallowing must have a simple position.
John Smith developed it in the 1970s to help people with no experience in making origamis or those with reduced mobility.
In children, awareness of race and racial stereotypes develops early, and these stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, children who identify themselves with a racial minority who, according to stereotypes, do not do their best at school, usually do not do well when they learn about this stereotype.
MySpace is currently the third for the popularity of the website in the United States, covering 54 million profiles.

A set of disorders notes “is a neurological accident, defined classicly by the triad of symptoms: impulse, deconcentration and overpowering or excessive energy”.
It's not a disability, it's a learning disorder, which " affects from 3 to 5 percent of children, maybe even 2 million American children".
Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on science, but they can focus on what makes them happy, such as playing games or watching favorite cartoons or writing sentences without any punctuation.
These children have a tendency to get involved in trapata, which is because they "take risk behaviours, fights and subjugate authorities" to stimulate the brain because they cannot achieve this stimulation by normal methods.
ADD has an impact on relationships with drivers who may have problems with understanding why someone behaves in such a way as to why it says so and why their level of maturity is different.
Knowledge and learning skills have changed in the way described above, thus changing the pace of learning.
The relationship to obtaining information was different. The press was no longer in individual memory, but became more important the ability to bring the text.
In principle, Renaissance has significantly changed the approach to science and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other main hominids, they no longer use their hands to move, carry weights or move between trees.
The hands and feet of chimpanzees have a similar size and length, which shows that the hands are used to carry the weight of the body when walking on lean hands.
The human hand is shorter than the feet and has simpler thumbs.
Rocky bones from two to three million years ago show how hand specialization has changed, from movement to manipulation.
According to some, the frequent awakening of conscious dreams can lead to exhaustion.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that conscious dreams lengthen the time between the REM phases.
If a smaller phase of paradox sleep falls at night, the problem becomes a low frequency of the state in which you actually sleep and your body regenerates.
It's as exhausting as waking up as much as twenty or thirty minutes after watching TV.
The frequency with which the brain tries to dream consciously during that night has an effect.
Practically from the beginning of the Italian case in North Africa, 11 Husaria Brittian took Fort Capuzo in Libya, a week after the Italian war on 10 June 1940.

Recreational tourism is perhaps the most common type of tourism, for most people associated with travel.
Then people move to places that are completely different from what surrounds them every day to relax and have fun.
Beaches, thematic parks and bivouac fields are usually the most popular places used by recreational tourists.
Cultural tourism means a type of tourism that involves the knowledge of the history and culture of the places visited.
Tourists can visit various characteristic sites in the country or can focus only on one area.
The colonists, looking at this activity, also called for food.
The frontal strengthening effects consisted of New Hampshire's 1st and 3rd Colonels, who number 200, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed, both of whom were later generals.
The Star Commands were set up along the northern border of the position occupied by the Colonists.
When the flow opened the free passage along the Mystic River from the north-east side of the peninsula, they quickly extended the reinforcement of a short stone wall from the north coast on the small beach.
Gridley or Stark shot the ball at about 100 feet (30 m) away from the reinforcement and ordered not to shoot until the inflators crossed this line.
The U.S. plan has set up coordinated attacks on three different sides.
General John Cadwalder will start a diversion against the British garrison in Bordentown to block any support.
General James Ewing was about to cross the river at Trenton Ferry, along with a 700-person police force, take over the Assunpink Creek bridge and make the escape of enemy armies.
There was a section of 2,400 armed men who were supposed to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and split, creating two divisions, one under Greene's leadership, the other under Sullivan's leadership, to launch an attack before dawn.
When the distance of the race changes from one quarter to half a mile, speed loses meaning and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a ball runner in half a mile, which can break for two minutes, must be at an appropriate high speed, but endurance must be taken care of at all costs.
Some winter turns, combined with upper body parts training, are the best preparation for the running season.
Proper nutrition does not guarantee perfect results, but may significantly affect the overall form of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, applying effective watering habits and understanding the various aspects of supplementation can help athletes improve their performance and increase their pleasure in sport.
The distance runs are relatively low sports, but there are many myths about several essential items of equipment.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most of them will have a devastating or zero impact on performance.
Sportsmen may feel that they prefer the product, although it does not offer any real benefits.
Atom can be considered one of the fundamental elements that build the whole material.
It is a very complex unit that consists, according to the simple Bohr model, of the central nucleus around which are electrons, something that reminds the planets surrounding the Sun – see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
In terms of electrical charge, protons are additional, electrons are negative, and neutrons have no charge.
To check what's wrong with you, you first have to assess whether the location of the incident is not a threat to you.
As you approach the victim, keep an eye on its location, and take note of the natural warning signals.
If you get hurt trying to help, you'll only get worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and pessimistic attitude were closely linked to the pain and fracture of those suffering from the pain of the cross.
Only the effects of catastrophic thinking were dependent on regular, organised daily physical exercises, but such dependence did not occur in the event of depression and fear.
Persons engaging in regular activity need more support when it comes to a negative perception of pain in order to distinguish chronic pain and discomfort from normal movement.
The vision, that is, the ability to see, depends on the organs of the mind of the vision, the eye.
The structure of the eye can be very different in terms of complexity, which depends on the requirements of the body.
Different systems are characterized by different possibilities, are sensitive to different lengths of waves and vary in degree of sharpness of vision, and also require different processes to interpret input data, and the appropriate number of organs to function optimally.
The population is called a collection of organisms of one species, which are located in a given geographical area.
All individuals in the population with a specific phenotype are called monomorphic.
When individuals are characterized by several variants of this feature, they are polymorphic.
The colonies of military ants massage and plant nests in other phases as well.
At the fishing stage, an army of ants masturbates at night and camps during the day.
The colony begins with the cavities phase when the amount of food available has decreased. During this phase the colony creates temporary nests that are changed each day.
Every one of these grads or marches lasts for about 17 days.
What is the cell? This word is derived from the Latin 'cell', meaning 'small room', and was bitten by a researcher who was looking at the structure of the path under the microscope.
The cell is the basic building of all living organisms in which at least one cell must be included.
In fact, the role of cells in the study of life is so fundamental and crucial that they are often referred to as “life-saving elements”.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses to the body so that blood flow is not disturbed.
These nerve impulses penetrate the body at such high speeds that they help to protect them from potential danger.
Tornadas hit a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything on their way.
The tornados are breaking down trees, removing boards from buildings and throwing cars in the air. The most powerful two percent of tornados lasts more than three hours.

Many people dream of the day when they will be able to travel to another star and discover other worlds; some wonder what is there, some believe that other planets inhabit foreigners or other forms of life.
But if it ever happens, it's not for a long time.
Maybe your lawyers will ever be living in a foreign world, thinking about their ancient ancestors?
The animals are built from many cells, they eat things and they are wet. Most animals can move.
The brain is an organ that we find only in animals, and not in everyone, for example, the medus don't have a brain.
There is no such place on earth as there would be no animals.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms (things).
The word "cell" is a Latin word meaning "cell" which means a small space.
Looking at living creatures under the microscope, you can notice that they are built from small squares or spheres.
Robert Hook, an English biologist, looked at the step below the microscope and saw small squares.
He was the first person to observe dead cells.
The originals and connections may move from one state to the other and not change.
The nitrogen in the form of gas still has identical properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid is denser, but the particles are identical.
Another example is water, consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
The molecular structure is identical for gas, fluids and permanent body.
Although the focus may change, the chemical composition remains unchanged.
Time is around us, it affects every action we take, and it's so hard to grasp.
For thousands of years, it has been the subject of research by scholars, philosophers and theologians.
We experience time as a part of events from the future, through the present, to the past.
The time is also used to compare the duration of events (their length in time).
You can mark the flow of time on your own by observing the return of a cyclic event that is characterized by regular repetition.

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was long recognized that the first population of New Zealand was Maoris, hunting on giant birds called mine.
According to this theory, the Maoris moved the Great Fleet from Polynesia to New Zealand and took it to the people of Moriori, after which they settled as an agricultural community.
However, the latest evidence indicates that the Moriori tribe was a group of continental Maoris who moved from New Zealand to Chatham Island and developed their own peaceful culture.
On the island of Chatham was also another tribe, Maoris, who emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, got to be a couple of years old, and eventually Moriori was buried.
People who have been giving since several decades have made it clear that we have seen the value of our advantages and affections, and on the other hand, we have been able to look at difficulties and failures honestly.
When we listened to people who told stories about their personal life, family or work, we received a lot of valuable information about the past and about the personalities that had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the organization.
Although understanding its history does not imply understanding of culture, it at least helps to understand where we are in the history of the organization.
The assessment of the successes and awareness of the failures of individual individuals, as well as the entire group of participants, better know the values, mission and motivation of the organisation.
In this case, people opened up to new changes and a new direction for the local church, mentioning the business behaviour and its success in the past.
Such stories of these successes have eased the fears of change, and have inspired a positive attitude to change in the future.
Methods of solving problems using different concepts or fields to find a solution called convergence thinking patterns.
Such thinking focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as the identification of facts, the re-use of available techniques and the collection of information.
The most important element of this way of thinking: there is only one correct answer. You take only two answers – good and bad.
Such a type of understanding is related to certain sciences or standard procedures.
People with such thinking can think logically, remember patterns, solve problems and scientific tests.
People are the most powerful species in the world when it comes to reading in the minds of others.
As a result, we can effectively predict what others see and intend to believe what they know and what they want.
The most important of these skills is the understanding of the intentions of others, as this makes it possible to develop possible uncertainties resulting from the actions taken.
For example, when you see someone driving a car, you probably assume that he's trying to steal someone's car.
It would be different if he lost the keys to the car and tried to break into his vehicle.
The MRI is based on a phenomenon called a magnetic nuclear resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (worker at Stanford University) and Edward Purcella (worker at Harvard).
In this resonance, atoms emit delicate radio signals under the influence of magnetic fields and radio waves.
In 1970, a doctor and scientist Raymond Damadian discovered how to use magnetic resonance imaging for medical purposes.
Four years later, the patent was the first patent in the world in the field of magnetic resonance.
In 1977 Dr. Damadian completed the scan to resonance with the entire body, which he called "Unbreakable".
Asynchronous communication gives time to think and answer another person.
This enables students to work at their own pace and control the pace of instruction.

Students can also report questions to teachers every day and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next direct meeting.
Postmodern approach to science gives freedom from absolute truth. There is no good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one thing that should be learned from science. Learning is a process that takes place in the context of a relationship between a person who is learning and who knows what is presented.
This is an example of our current experience in television programs that present information, education, teaching and providing practical advice (“do the same”).
Many of us watch television programs that convey knowledge that we never use, and show experiences that will never become our share.
We never repair the car, we don't put the fountain in the yard, we don't go to Peru to watch ancient ruins, or we don't rebuild the neighbor's house.

Although you hear that word from the natives of Greenland, foreigners should not use it.
Greenland Aboriginals themselves call themselves Inuits in Canada and Kalaalleq (Mr. Kalaalit), or "Greenlands" in Greenland.
Crime and evil will against foreigners are actually unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "dangerous environments".
The cold is probably the only real threat people will face.
If you visit Greenland during the colder times of the year, take enough warm clothes with you (from the north to the colder).

Tourist tours are very expensive, require good physical conditions, can only be summer (from November to February) and are mainly limited to halfway, the island and the Red Sea.
During the summer, about fifty bases in these areas are inhabited by several thousand workers, but only a small number of them spend in the winter.
