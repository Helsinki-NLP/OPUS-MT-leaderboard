Karno is well-known, but it's an English-based equivalent, which taught under the honor of contemporary education and the king, claiming that he had 9,000 students at the top of his career.
In his writings, he used words that some parents considered harsh and said that he had used insults in the classroom.
Modern education accuses him of posting and lying on buses without permission, saying he's the principal English teacher.
He was also accused of violating copyright in the past, but was not charged.
The former student said that he "was using the classroom, teaching the practice of dating, and just being a friend of the students."
Although China has remained officially a Communist state in the last three decades, it has developed a market economy.
The first economic improvements were made during the management of Deng Xaoping.
Since then, China's economy has increased by 90 times.
For the first time last year, China has manufactured more cars than Germany and moved forward from the United States as the largest market in this automotive industry.
In two decades, China's GDP may be bigger than the United States.
Daniel's solar storm, the fourth season of the 2010 Atlantic storm, was formed in the east of the Atlantic Ocean.
Potoric, located about 3,000 miles from the city of Miami in Florida, has a maximum of 40 miles/h (64 km/h) steady winds.
Scientists at the Potorians National Center predict that Danielle will be able to get into a storm by Wednesday.
Because the storm is far from health, it's still hard to appreciate its possible impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in Zagreb, Croatia's capital, was famous for playing at Belgrade's Parish.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.

People were hitting windows with chairs, but the windows weren't broken.
One of the monkeys was finally broken, and they started going out through the window," said rescued Francisk Kowal.
The stars emit light and heat from the extraction of hydrogen atoms (or fusion) by forming heavier elements together.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can get energy on the same path.
This, however, is a very difficult problem, and it will take years to see how useful assembly reactors are built.
The palm tree swims on the water's face because of the surface tension.
The tension of the surface is due to the fact that the water molecules on the surface of the surface of the water are much closer together than the air molecules above.
Water molecules create invisible layer of water on the surface, which allows things like the needle to swim in the face of water.
The layers of modern nebulae that are designed for freezing have a double end, between which there are gypsum pads, both of which allow to hold better than ice, even when it's freezing.
Because the bottom part of the tachograph is a small loss, because the tachograph is pointing this or that side, the end of the ice is also going to disappear.
It doesn't have to turn the muscle. If the muscles are pushed to the right, the muscle is turned to the right, and if the muscles are pushed to the left, the muscle is pushed to the left.
To get back to their former energy level, they need to get rid of the extra energy they've got from the light.
They're doing it by producing the smallest part of light called photo.
Scientists call this process "in a light-enhanced atmosphere," because the atoms are driven by a light-enhanced light, and the light is a kind of light-enhanced light.
The next picture shows how the atoms produce the photos, and of course, the photos are much smaller than the pictures they picture.
The photons are even smaller than the material from which the atom is made.
After hundreds of hours of operation, the lamp number is finally lit and the lamp is not working.
And then you have to change the electric lamp, and then you have to be careful when you change the lamp.
The first thing you need to do is turn off the switch or turn off the switch.
It's because the electric power of the child's entrance, where the metal part of the lamp is attached, can cause a strong electrical shock if you touch the inside of the child or the metal base of the lamp while it's still in the child.
The most important organ in the cardiovascular system is the heart that causes blood.
Blood goes from the heart through vessels called ticks and returns through vessels called heart tumors, and the largest vessels are called masanites.
The teeth of the treteratops could be broken not only by leaves, but also by very narrow branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the cesaceans ate peanuts that were typical of plants during the Age period.
These plants are like small roots, which have sharp, rotten leaves at the top.
The thorny dinosaur could use his powerful to remove leaves before eating a plant.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very toxic, so it's unlikely that any dinosaurs would have eaten them, even though today they can eat poisonous leaves or fruit, and other animals like the butterfly (the descendant of the dinosaur).
If you stand on the surface of Yo, you'll have less weight than you weigh on the earth.
The man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Yo. So gravity certainly weighs less on you.
The sun doesn't have the earth's outer surface on which to stand. The sun is made up of gases, fires, and plasma.
The gas gets softer when you move from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the sun that we can see is called the light bulb.
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used an asterisk and saw that Venus is like a moon.
The pillars follow each other, because only one side of Venus (or Moon) that looks at the sun is lit, and the degrees of Venus support Copernicus' theory, so that the planets are moving around the sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horox noticed the transfer of Venus.
After Denlo's resuscitation, England was at peace for a long time.
However, in 991, Etlered worked with the Viking shipyard, which has been the largest since the time of Gutrum for a century.

After the war's initial failure, Ethelred was able to agree to the conditions of Olaf, who returned to Norway, trying to defeat his kingdom successfully.
Hangul is the only specially created alphabet used on a daily basis. The alphabet was created in 1444 during King Sejung (1418 - 1450).
The King of Joson was the fourth king of the dynasty, and he was one of the most respected.
At first, he called Hangwell's alphabet Hanmi in Jonghe, which means "the right sounds of teaching people."
There's a lot of theories about how Sanskrit came out. One of them is about migration from the West of Aryan to India, and they brought the language with them.
Sanskrit is the oldest language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The world's earliest known book was written by Sanskrit, and after the formation of signs, Sanskrit just died because of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served as a starting point for many Indian languages, as Latin is the starting point for European languages, such as French and Spanish.
After the war for France ended, Germany began preparing to invade the island of Britain.
The German attack code put "Operation Sea lion." The British army lost most of the heavy weapons and supplies when it was evacuated from Denmark, so the army was too weak.
But the royal shipyard was even stronger than the German shipyard (Crygsmar), and could destroy any invading ship that was sent out by an English storm.
However, very few of the Royal Navy ships were located near the likely incursion routes, because the marines were afraid that they could be wrecked by a German air raid.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans. Italy was mostly the "small brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker vessel, even though they had built four new ships before the war.
Italy's main goal was the African countries. To attract those countries, they needed a level of force so that the armies could sail along the Mediterranean Sea and conquer Africa.
That's why they had to be freed from British troops and ships in Egypt, except for those actions, Italian fighters should not do anything else.
Now about Japan, it was in the island country, like Britain.
Suzanne ships are designed for underground voyages, and they stay there for a long time.
Suzanne was used in the first and second world wars, and they were moving very slowly and had a very limited distance to shoot.
At the beginning of the war, they walked mostly across the sea, but along with the development of the radar and becoming more accurate, they had to avoid going under the water.
The Germans were called Yu ships, and the Germans were good at sailing and controlling their submarines.
As a result of the success of Suzana's efforts, after the war, Germans do not trust them to have much.
Yes, Tutanhamo King, sometimes called Tut King or Tla King, is one of the most famous ancient kings of Egypt today.
Interestingly, in ancient times, he was not considered very important, and there is no record of him on the list of many ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him known, unlike the other ancient tombs that had been dug, this one had remained in fact unscrupulous.
Most of the things buried with Tutanhaman have been well preserved, including precious metals and rare stones, thousands of historical objects.
The discovery of the rounds helped the Syrian vehicles to be lighter, faster and better prepared for the soldiers and other vehicles to run.
Their deadly arrows could have hit the enemy's remains, and in about 1000 B.C.E., the Syrians presented the first rider.
The rider is a kind of force that fights on the horse, and the camp has not yet been discovered, so the Assyrian rider fought on the naked back of the horses.
We know a lot of Greek politicians, scientists and artists -- probably the most famous of these cultures is Homeros, the famous blind poet who created the masterpieces of Greek literature -- the Illy and Odyssian poems.

The number of speakers is from 340 million to 500 million and more than 800 million people can understand the language.
Mindy and Urdu agree from the point of view of vocabulary, but they're different in writing: in everyday conversations, people who speak two languages usually understand each other.
About the 15th century, northern Estonia was under the powerful cultural influence of Germany.
Some Germans wanted the locals to be closer to God, so they invented a literary Estonian.
It was based on the German alphabet, and the label Õ/õ was added.
As time went by, many words that were changed from German were boiled, and this was the beginning of education.

The European Turkey (Eastern Thracian or Rumilia, the Balkan Peninsula) includes 3% of the country.
Turkey's territory is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) and is about 800 km (500 miles) wide.
In view of the lakes, Turkey covers 783,562 square miles (300,948 square miles), 755,688 square miles (291,773 square miles) in South-West Asia, and 23,764 square miles (9,174 square miles) in Europe.

Turkey is surrounded by three seas -- the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it gained its independence in 1839.
The present parts of Belgium were previously part of Luxembourg, but then they became the Belgians in the 1830s, after the Belgian revolution.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, but as in World War I, the World War II has been attacked by Germany.
In 1957, Luxembourg became the main member of an organization that is now known as the European Union.
Dr. Dsonge is a broken fortress and a Buddhist van in the upper part of the Pero district (Fonday village).
It's said in 1649 that Zabdrung Ngawang Namgiel founded the fortress to inspire his victory over the Tibetan forces.
In 1951, as a result of the fire, there was only a part of the Drugel Jong, such as the image of the Shabdruung Ngawang Namgaget.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining one of Bhutan's most beautiful sights.
In the 18th century Cambodia was under pressure from its two powerful neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, the Thais invaded Cambodia several times, and in 1772 they destroyed Fnom Fen.

In order to create interactive media, we need conditional and traditional skills, as well as tools that have been used in interactive classes (in images, audio and video recordings, stories, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to rethink your assumptions about information creation and to think about non-linear ways.
In line with the requirements of interactive design, the components of the program should be connected to each other, at the same time not meaningless as a separate part.
The lack of increasing objects is that the complexity of the focus lengths and the number of objects is much greater than the focus's permanent remote objects.
This is becoming a less important problem, because object manufacturers achieve higher standards in the field of this product.
This has allowed the variable focal distance to be obtained by an object of quality that is comparable to a fixed focal length of the object.
Another weakness of the magnifying objects is that the maximum openness of the objects is usually lower.
This makes it difficult for non-precious bumpers, without lighting in low light conditions.
One of the most common problems in converting the film is the size of the image.
Most of the television is used to satisfy most of the public.
That's why, all you see on TV, there were high limits on the top, the inside and the side.
This is done to ensure that the image includes the entire screen. It's called the total.
Unfortunately, when you're making a DVD, it's probably going to cut its edges too, and if the captions of the video are very close to the bottom, they won't appear at all.
The traditional medieval fortress has inspired the imagination of people for years, enchanting the images of the Soviet singles, the associated feasts, and the patronage of King Arthur.
Even standing in the thousands of years of ruins, it's easy to remember the voices and the voices of the long-standing battles that have taken place, to hear almost the noise of the shells of the shells and to take the flock out of the subgenital cracks.
But is our imagination really based on reality?
In time, the Kirby Muxlo fortress is a more well-established house than a real fortress.
Its large, glass windows and walls would not be able to withstand a decisive attack for a long time.
In the 1480s, when the building started by Lord Stings, the land was relatively peaceful and only needed protection from small firearms.
The force balance was a system in which European nations wanted to maintain the national self-government of all European states.
The view was that all European nations should strive not to let a nation become powerful, so national governments often change their plans to maintain balance.
The war for Spanish heritage marked the first war, the main problem of which was the balance of forces.
This has become an important change, because European forces will no longer have a solution to religious wars, so the Thirty-Year War will be the last one to be destroyed as a religion.
The temple of Artemis, in Ephesus, was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E. as a result of a fire by Jerome.
According to history, his enthusiasm was famous for any cost. The despised Ephesians announced that the name of Herod would never be recorded.
Greek historian Strobon later named it, and here's how we know today, the temple was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
As King Alexander proposed to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but his offer was rejected; later on, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
Make sure that your hand is as calm as possible, so that all the notes are pressed correctly, and try not to make too much movement with your fingers.
In this case, you'll get as little comfort as possible, and remember, to get an extra voice, you don't need to hit the keys with great power as in a keyboard.
To get an additional voice on the academia, you need to use the goofries at a faster or faster speed.
Consciousness is to be the principal reality, to be a God, to be a messenger of spiritual truth, or to be acquainted with these things, or to be acquainted with them in a conscious way.
The believer is looking for just experience, intuition, or understanding to divine reality, or gods.
Followers are following certain lifestyles or practices designed to develop these experiences.
Consciousness can be distinguished from other forms of religious faith and worship by its emphasis on the unique state of consciousness, on personal experience, in particular its peaceful, inspiring, blessed or even wonderful nature.
Sikhism is a religion that originated from the Indian subterranean world, and it originated in the 15th century as a result of the Hindu tradition of Hinduism.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a religion separate from Hinduism, even though they accept its Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which means "Guru's Way". Guru is the fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but Sikhism has gained importance as the foundation of Sikh's beliefs.
The religion was founded by Guru Nakak in the 15th century (1469-1539), and then there were nine more caves.

Indus Valley civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the north-west of the Indian subcontinent, which includes most of Pakistan today and some circuits in the north-west of India and in the north-east of Afghanistan.
The culture flourished in the valleys of the Indus River, and its name was derived from it.
Although some scientists believe that because civilization has existed in the valley of the present-day Sarasvat river, it must be duly called Indian-Sasvatian civilization, and some call it Harappa civilization, the first of which was demolished in the 1920s.
The Roman Empire's military nature contributed to the development of medical advances.
The Emperor of August began to co-operate with doctors and even created the first Roman medical corps to use for the consequences of post-war warfare.
The surgeons had knowledge of various restorative drugs, including morphine from the seeds of the cascade, and scopolamine from the seeds of the herb.
They've been trained in detoxification, to rescue patients from cancer, and to stop blood flow, and to save them from blood clots.
For centuries, the Roman Empire has had great achievements in the field of medicine and has shaped most of what we know today.
The Pyrland Origami is a regular limitation that can be carried out immediately by only one mass, more complex mass, such as reverse mass, is not allowed, and all mass is located directly.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s, to help unexploited professionals and those with limited mobility.
Children are very young to form a perception of racial and racial prejudices, and these racial prejudices affect behavior.
For example, children with a racial minority label, with a belief that they don't learn well at school, are thinking about not being good at school when they learn about their belief in race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States, and it now has 54 million users.
These sites have been given great attention, especially in educational institutions.
These sites have a positive side, which includes an easy-to-class setup that can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page can easily be accessed, using only one website, which makes it easy for students who have difficulty in using a handbook or spelling.
It can be adapted so as to be easy to read, as well as any choice of color.
Attention-centering disorder is "a logistic syndrome, which is a threefold class definition of symptoms, including impulses, confusion and hyperactivity or excess energy."
It's not an inability to learn, it's an obstacle to learning -- it affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, probably about 2 million American children.
Children with a lack of attention are spending a lot of time focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can focus on things that they enjoy, such as playing games or watching their favorite movies or writing presentations without giving up.
These children tend to have problems because they are "integrated into risk actions, fall into battle and challenge the government" to stimulate their brains because their brains cannot be moved by normal methods.
UDD affects relationships with peers because other children are unable to understand why they do that, or why they do that, or that their level of maturity is different.
Since knowledge and learning skills have changed as mentioned above, many new knowledge skills have changed.
The approach to getting information was different. The pressure was no longer dependent on one person's opinion, and the ability to remember the text was earned more attention.
In essence, Rebirth made a significant change in the approach and dissemination of learning.
Unlike other primitives, Homicides no longer use their hands when moving or hanging on trees or keeping their weight.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee have the same size and length, which when walking with their knees reflects the use of the hand to keep the weight.
The hand of a man is shorter than his foot, and the arms of his fingers are more straight.
From two million to three million years ago, the bones of the hand of the brand show a change in the hand's specificity, from movement to movement.
Some people think that a lot of artificially created gin dreams can be quite common in a very tiring nature.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that, as a result of simple dreams, the U.S. states have long-lasting periods of time.
Having less sleep in your sleep during the night, the situation in which you're actually asleep and your body is being restored becomes not enough to become a problem.
It's as tiring as if you woke up every twenty or thirty minutes and had a TV diet.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream consciously during the night.

During the formal game, there are eleven floors, and usually players start from the first floor and end in the tenth.
He wins the player who hits or pushes the team to finish the course.
The game is played on the grass, and the grass on the back of the hole is cut short, and it's called green.
Maybe the most popular kind of holiday is what many people have to do with the holiday holiday that's going back to the rest of the world.
This is when people go to a place that is different from their normal everyday life to relax and have fun.
Walks, thematic resorts, and camp areas are often the most visited resorts for treatment.
If the purpose of someone's visit is to get to know the history and culture there, then this kind of holiday is known as a cultural holiday.
You can visit a wide variety of sights in a particular country or just focus on only one area.
And the prospectors, seeing this activity, also called for the accumulation of forces.
The leading forces included 200 of the New Hampshire's 1st and 3rd forces under the leadership of John Stark and James Reid (both became generals later).
The rock people took their positions north of the Colonist Bay, along the desert.
When the lower slope opened the gap along the Mystic river, which is on the north-east side of the peninsula, they through a short stone wall to the north, they quickly extended the horizon, which ended up on a small beach.
Greedley or Stark set about 100 feet (30 m) above the desert and ordered that no one fire until the regular forces passed it.
The American program was based on three different directions of attack.
General John Kedvolder had to start a Diversion attack against the British Emperor in Bordentown to prevent any strengths.
General James Eving, with 700 police forces, will cross the Trenten Ferry River to the Assupins Creek Bay, and to the escape of enemy forces.
The main offensive forces -- 2,400 men -- would cross the river from Trenton to the north, and then split into two groups -- one under Green and one under Sullivan -- to start the attack by Monday.
If one quarter changes in half a mile's race, speed loses its importance, and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, the main half-mile runner -- a man who can exceed two minutes -- must really be very fast, but endurance must be cultivated at all costs.
In the winter, some of the obstacles that are associated with the upper part of the body are considered the best preparation of the race.
Only the right diet can lead to high-quality speech, but it can significantly affect the overall health of young professionals.

The atom can be considered one of the fundamental elements of the entire structure of matter.
It's a very complex structure, which, according to the simple Bohry model, consists of a central nucleus that rotates by electrons, and what kind of planets that rotate around the sun look like.
The molecule is made up of two particles: neutrons and protons.
The protons have a positive electric flow, while the neurons have no flow; the electrons have a negative electric flow.

The participants in the ritual activities require more support from the negative view of pain, distinguishing the differences in chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort from normal physical movements.
The ability to see or see depends on the emotional organs or eyes of the visual system.
There's a lot of different structures in the eye that are different from their complexity, depending on the demands of the body.
Different structures have different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths, and have different degrees of this, and they also require different cultures to understand input data, and that different numbers work optimally.
The population is a collection of special types of organisms in a geographic area.
When all people in one society are the same with a certain phenotypic quality, they're known as uniforms.

Like gas, it has the same characteristics as liquid nitrogen, but the liquid is thicker, but the molecules are the same.
The water is another example, the complex water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it's gas or liquid or solid.
Although its physical condition may change, the chemical composition remains the same.
Time is something that completely surrounds us and affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and academic scientists.
Our time is like a chain of events that goes from the future to the past.

For a long time during the 19th and 20th centuries, it was thought that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who were engaged in a huge bird hunt called Moa.
Then the theory confirmed the idea that the Maori had fled from Poland with a large shipyard and captured New Zealand from Moria, based on a farming society.
However, the new evidence shows that the Moriahs were a group of mainland Maori who moved from New Zealand to the island of Chatham, developing their unique, peaceful culture.

At the same time, the examples of thinking are ways of solving problems that combine different ideas or areas to find a solution.
This thinking is focused on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as on the equalization of evidence, overhauling existing techniques and collecting information.
The most important factor in thinking is that there's only one correct answer; you're just thinking about two answers -- right or wrong.
This kind of thinking is related to certain processes of scientists or modifiers.
People with such thinking have rational thinking and are able to remember certain regulations, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
People, of course, are the most ridiculous type of reading.
That means we can successfully predict what other people think, think about what they believe, know, or want.
The main thing about these abilities is to understand the intentions of others, and it allows you to solve the possible dualities of physical activity.
