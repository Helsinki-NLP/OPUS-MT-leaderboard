Inflation in Europe jumped due to food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is due mainly to a steady rise in food prices.
The November price growth in the 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, with an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent registered in October, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union announced.
The official forecast predicted only 3 percent, announced by Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce its basic interest rate by reducing its share of raw materials and reducing unemployment by creating an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two per cent, however close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation must be "drafted", so that it does not have to do anything later in this matter.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 per cent of the 15-year record; then in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has erupted due to rising food and energy prices.
Terminator prices of wheat stood at 88 per cent, and the soybean price also reached the highest values since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for the oil and milk products.
The price of oil on world markets rose by 52 percent this year, and last month one barrel of black gold was already worth nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will increase in 2008 from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, 12-month inflation rates will continue to remain at approximately 3 per cent in the next 3-4 months, although its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to lower interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees the government crisis
The group of supporters of the Fidesz movement after the ongoing stagnation to the beginning of December has grown significantly, and so now it has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Institute's Socialists, the 13% support has never yet been targeted.
In the case of certain parties' wishes, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition's wishes - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of support against the five MSZP support.
The MDFs and SZDSZ are, according to the survey, under the threshold for entry into parliament: their support for the entire population is two percent.
Among certain voters of the party are the supporters of both camps by one percent more.
The public's opinion on the economy has also worsened, given the previous minimum - it has never been the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while according to the remaining 46 per cent, the situation is quite bad.
The family's assessment of the change in its material situation after the spring and summer prospects is now more pessimistic.
As for next year, the majority of the population is affected by further deterioration and only a dozen with improvement.
In December, 71% of respondents were judged, most of all of Gallup's Institute's current research, that the prime minister is doing his job more badly than well.
Ference believes Gyurcsány or very much believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Victor Orbán shares 38 percent of the beneficiaries.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54 percent, the President of Fidesz moves 27 percent.
One of the indicators for the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be resolved without a change in the government.
While the government and the Prime Minister have considered the suspension of 35 per cent after last October's disturbances, at present this percentage is only 20 per cent, with the relative majority (33 per cent) looking at the solution only in writing new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is apparent that 60 percent of the respondents answered the question of their possible participation, that it would certainly come and another 20 percent said it would probably come.
For comparison, "parliamentary elections scheduled this week" would certainly be attended by only 55 per cent and another 15 per cent considered their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be beyond doubt on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, the doctor's fees 79, and the hospital's residence fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who certainly promise to participate, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital residence fees would be 81, 84, and 89 percent.
The dearest is Auchan, nearly five of Tesco's instigated
Hypermarkets in the Buddhist trade triangle maintained a last year, on average 16% of the price level, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
An article in the newspaper Napi Masterság
The usual Christmas consummation basket of Napi Myság in the Budaurs trade triangle increased by 16 percent this year, although in all the hypermarkets, the price showed an increase of not less than a thousand forints.
Since the prices in supermarkets are already high in December, as a percentage of the previous high base has not shown such drastic distortions.
For the consumer, however, it is certainly not joyous to know that what could have been bought at a price below nine thousand forts will not be arranged now for ten thousand.
The consumption basket of the daily economy in the tested hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of at least ten thousand forints by 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 there was a consumption basket of 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and the living fish remained almost at the last level, although the raw breast, nuts, and also worms were very acute.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread even for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of two litres of Coca Coly in the bottle was below 200 forints, so that only 257 forints were made in stock.
However, this year, according to the consumption basket, Napi Mastersag Auchan appeared as the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our brochures, prices in the consumer basket of Napi Masterság were raised due to the Christmas Cora prices of 15, while Tesco i Auchan was around 18 percent.
When comparing the last highest and this year's lowest value of the consumption basket, the difference was 12 per cent, while the increase between the lowest last and this year's highest is 21 per cent.
In the United States there was an increase of 1,480.
The average increase in the price of February was 1,206 forints, with the price being affected by the increase in VAT.
It is precisely that the trade process has broken down, and the trade houses have obviously not been able to decide how large price ranges are to be determined for individual products, since they have not been able to predict the impact of changing prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the product concerned incorrectly, the price range may result in significant profit due to the adjusted intensity of the product.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of Napi Myság’s consumption basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest made the price difference of 844 forts.
This year the final difference did not appear, the most expensive basket now stood by 1,630 forints more than February and also the cheapest one by 1,284 forints.
In comparison with the two Christmas season, a catastrophic increase in prices appeared, and in less than 20 months the daily consumption in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 per cent.
(For example, this is not entirely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office's data: in the case of a few basic foods, the price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
Other than milk, for example, also in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumption basket of the Daily Economy, it seems almost impossible because the price level of the product, quite expensive already in the past year, has proved to be the basis even in the worst case the price growth almost 10 per cent.
Suppliers of flours take a stronger position than egg suppliers, and have been able to rise dramatically in international chains as well.
The hypermarkets in the gold triangle do not complain, they still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited stores are no longer interested in the price.
They're buying everything. They're buying cash, they're buying sustainable food.
On Wednesday morning, in all three supermarkets, long fronts were created at the store, as the number of visitors grew rapidly.
However, as we know, rural development is lower, more international networks complains to research firms that markets remain behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are used.
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overload of beds, overload of staff stopping the disease do not help, the National Epidemiological Centre's prime minister.
In many places there are also disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatological department of St. John's Hospital.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics were found in a man who was hospitalized after a serious transport accident.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infections occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious auto accident was released at home, however soon thereafter had to return with MRSA infection and due to the bacteria in its body, one important operation could not yet be performed.
By December 10th, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant diseases were reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröčová, the primary of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant diseases have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others do not know.
Nearly two thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilin, with a resistant golden staphylococcus.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries a third of the people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. inflammation of the liver, inflammation of the jaw, infection of the skin, infection of the wound) respond well to antibiotics and are treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excessive or inappropriate extent, the bacteria that react well to the antibiotic of the bacteria, which is very resistant to antibiotics, will develop rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, in the case of transient or persistent failure of the immune system in patients with weakened body, low body weight or in patients over the years, serious hospital infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning may cause sepsis.
According to the Supreme Doctor of St. John's Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections in hospitals belong to day-to-day practice.
"Infection must not be replaced by an epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the cause of the disease is not examined."
Adopts Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, treating them in rubber gloves and in masks and for their treatment we need antibiotics," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients hospitalized are examined in advance whether MRSA is present or not, however, the infection cannot always be avoided.
Selection is not in fashion
The majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, however, the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not to prevent the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröčová.
As this infection is reportedly occurring in hospitals and nursing homes, patients treated should monitor and immediately isolate MRSA carriers.
However, the sampling of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
Most cases are so exposed if the patient suffers from a preventable MRSA infection, the primary epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strong recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to seek to target antibiotic therapy, or a microbiological examination should be carried out to prevent the emergence of resistance to medicinal products, even though they do not comply with it in all cases.
Microbiological samples are even more frequent in primary and ambulance patients treatment, said Karolina Böröczová.
It is stored on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most common among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but there are also serious deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted with capella infection and touch, but under the conditions of home patients, it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to themselves, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröčová noted, unfortunately, we can also meet with the fact that in hospitals that are in an adverse material situation, they are looking at disinfectants, there is little treatment available and many patients, which increases the chances of infection.
According to Karolina Böröčová, the necessary protective measures, such as infections are manifestly less or further spreads of the cause of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents enormous expenditure for health insurance, which is why it is fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written the MRSA prevention programme and reduced its existence.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the published data, they show a declining trend of MRSA infection in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) sets out the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the respective hospital infections caused by these pathogens, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official investigation in the case of the 21st district police captain, who caused a fatal accident, is ready.
It can be ruled out that the Chief of Staff of the District, who died a pedestrian on Tuesday and who, in the meantime, retired from his office, was under the influence of alcohol or magic substances, would inform the speaker of Attila Morvai's High State Representative on Friday after the final assessment of this case was completed.
The investigation confirmed the outcome of the original investigation, which has already found that the former police captain did not get any alcohol before he sat on the wheel.
The then Director of the 21st District Police Directorate hit Lajose Kossuth on Tuesday in the 21st District by his own personal car, turning the 15th-year-old man in front of him when passing the vehicle outside the designated crossing.
(The latter fact that the walker was passing through the zebra, the other is not a pleasant situation, the driving car must be given priority.)
After the transfer to the hospital, the walker died.
As a result of these events, the District Police Director withdrew from office and requested a transfer to service, according to the police report, because he was so upset.
In this case, the examination of the Budapest State Protest is carried out.
Attila Morvai also referred to the fact that the former police captain had been working with state investigators from the beginning.
Another 400 million euros in infrastructure
The three credit frameworks agreement amounting to EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy were signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungarian financial financing of transport and environment projects implemented under the Cohesion Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, with a loan agreement of EUR 100 million already entered into by the parties, which now covers the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance projects linked to education.
The EIB has approved for Hungary a total of EUR 300 million for these purposes, with the extension of the loan agreement to the remaining EUR 150 million.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a 50m-euro contract, which will use the budget mainly for the research-development project of the University of Debrecen.
The conversation was also about the 4th metro route.
The parties agreed that once Hungary agrees with the EU on the details of the funding of the meter, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Verese, this can occur in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed EUR 8.4 billion for a total of 113 projects.
The rate of credit provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to a somewhat detracted Balkan country.
What, where and who buys the cheapest yet cheaper, yet fast with the EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria is now the most sought-after eastern European property purchase goal with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
From the mountains are the most in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the seashore then Albena, the Golden Sands, the Sun Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the interest of investors and the central part of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and still more people - will be buying in the vicinity of the exhibition of the cheap city of Russia.
The main city of Sofia is also a pledge of pleasant opportunities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to change into one of the most attractive golf courses in Europe, and thus to stay alongside the summer and winter season sought for the trip even in the next two years.
Predictive investors are already buying in large, for example, in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but customers from France, Belgium, Spain and Romania are also more frequent.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors here, at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts, and then there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Emerging people buy either renovated properties of 50-100 thousand euros, or damaged old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which then renew.
They require good access and communication opportunities, which are important to them, the proximity of the big city, the shops and the usual local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of chat (Bulgaria ranks among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in hopes of a rise in value in the medium- or long-term horizon.
The city's real estate is uninterrupted, because demand is as strong as possible.
In Bulgaria, however, the lowest prices are reality in the European Union, but in the last five years they have grown by 21 per cent annually.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to the Minister of the Environment and Water Affairs of Gábor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and the international climate conference will continue with the ministerial talks after the mid-term start of 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are talking about the Bali Travel Map, which addresses the efforts following the reduction of emissions by the Kyoto Protocol in force by 2012.
They are currently being debated by storms between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not want to deal with exact numbers now, although they agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 in view of the 1990 situation.
Another big question for the conference is whether the developed countries will join in addition to the reduction of emissions to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are referred to it.
The agreement was also made on grants for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by the 16-member management board, probably within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the United Nations - we can read in the Piac es Profit magazine.
6 per cent of Hungary
The Minister for Environment and Water Affairs Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to play a leading role in efforts to protect the global climate and to assist in the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 against 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the adoption of the 2012 agreements, and is willing to commit up to 30 per cent reduction in the event that other mature countries in the world will also be willing to accept responsibility and commitments corresponding to their potential.
The Fódor Gábor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had reached the target of a 5.2 per cent reduction, with the then 15 EU Member States committed 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% against the years 1985-87, which our government will fulfil. - The press report of the Ministry of the Environment recalls.
Bali is a lot, because within two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would have moved into force until 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately reinvigorate the new emission reduction system, the necessity of which was also indicated in its latest report by the United Nations International Scientific Assembly dealing with climate change - IPCC, which is the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would result in a delay in emission reductions and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army on YouTube · Global Voices
British military units publish on the server to share video recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they promote themselves.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) favorites YouTube: the special units operating in Afghanistan here since March 2006 are recording videos from the actions against the Taliban, the BBC announced.
Recordings, arranged by a miniature camera attached to the application, are controlled by the Air Force Commanding Operations in the Kandahara area and then sent to London, where they are transmitted online.
Political message is inevitable
This form has already received 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers on the Internet and their "channel" has already been viewed by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Set-up in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original purpose for recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good for public awareness of the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
"The propaganda published in this form against traditional television advertising is almost nothing," the BBC expert told Gordon Mackenzie about the defence, "but it is also necessary to have a certain political message in it, because the special form confirms the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made a game
The army is concerned that alongside carefully adjusted, censored recordings on the server, amateur videos, including the death of soldiers, are also being received: in some covert, "official" promotional films, the officials at the top are talking about losses, but there is no bloody image of the battle.
There have been many videos on the Internet from the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which occurred during a sharp deployment, yet the British army has come upon them so far.
Americans perform a set a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get through more faithful simulations directly into the skin of soldiers.
Christmas in the Ministries with Tombol and Pagans
The Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is evidently not sentimental: instead of a holiday party, he organizes a final working meeting for his employees, which will be held in 2007.
In some ministries, there will be a celebration with live music, and elsewhere, it will give officials the Christmas atmosphere with a tombol and a drink.
Dinner, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so enjoys powerful.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive Christmas celebration this year is organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it does not expect its employees to do so.
About Christmas orphans will receive gifts from children of fallen soldiers, at Mission holidays host family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort is dedicated to the atmosphere at the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be dismissed by the other resorts.
The GKM dinner is held in the centre of Jöv′′ Haza, with a total of 4,320,000 forints and of the six hundred ministerial employees, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will be held at its celebration of Christmas traditions, but it will also come at various performances, and it will also drop the tombol.
The NFÜ Christmas was 4,700,000 forints and held on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinners were on the program.
The rental of the hall was made up of a million forints, the rest was set aside for more than four hundred invited.
One of the NFÜ departments seems to be invited to another holiday celebration: the company is organizing the tendering process, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they have rented a theater in Vígsínhaz.
The MAG did not confirm this information because we did not succeed in reaching the person concerned.
You don't need a suit.
The OIT building was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which organized the 7th December of St. Lucie's dance.
From him, however, the ILO did not want money for the use of its halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The dinner started by the Minister of Health, after dinner it was possible to dance for the escort of live music.
According to the answer to the portal question [origo] on the dance were not compulsory evening dress or clothing at all.
The Puritan party will host health resorts, work and local self-government.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and a celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
The Ministry of Labour Monika Lamperth's collaborators will not even officially call for a holiday party, but at the final working meeting.
There are hundreds of 80 guests who, according to the press department, only get coffee and pags, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the parties.
Minister for Local Self-Government Gordon Bajnai will simply add his collaborators to the Aule Ministry for Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) arranges a Christmas dinner, which includes 436 employees, in its own large hall.
The Christmas party is dedicated to 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and dishes.
Since being Minister János Veres, PM employees have been celebrating Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, officiality will enhance not only the ministerial talk, but also the afternoon of the event.
The farm resort organizes the 20th of January's New Year's reception, the Minister's Christmas doesn't know.
The reception will be carried out in the garden of Vajdahunyadvár in the City Plants and, according to the Ministry's announcement, 1,000 forts per person are for 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomat accreditation in Hungary is invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief visit by the Minister of Health.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, has informed the [orig] portal of the relevant press department.
The price of the holiday festival of the environment resort in the press department failed to communicate.
In each case, four hundred people were invited to a party at the Museum of Fine Arts.
It extends to the large station.
The Association of Associations of Associations of Associations of Associations of Associations of Associations of Associations of Associations of Associations of Trade Councils (MOSZ) will create its post commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's timeless events.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - will be stopped.
Action certainly causes a serious interruption of transport, as rail transport is almost completely stopped and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be in charge within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League will meet together with the International Association of Business Councils with details jointly organised Monday's events.
The LIGA-MOSZ Customs Commission will also be set up to coordinate Monday's actions.
On Saturday, there is a protest public meeting, then Monday, a committee joining the station will stop work for an indefinite period, unless a deal with the government is reached.
This means that the deadline was not set for the termination of the event, which begins on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the committees will withdraw immediately.
However, if the legislation is repealed, the Committee of Common Positions and any other procedure will be adopted.
According to the Monday agenda of the Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted on until late evenings, if necessary during the night hours.
Due to the start of the situation Monday, it is possible to calculate with serious interruptions of transport: the job will be stopped on the railway for an indefinite period, the part of the Budapest collective transport and more than half of Volán can be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, there are many places in the country to close half of the road.
A number of committees and civil organisations have joined in calling for the situation, whose list is kept up to date on the League’s website.
Some of the organizations have announced the status for a period of uncertainty, others have announced a temporary suspension of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railway (MÁV) and the Independent Association of Railway Employees (VDSZZZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while at the beginning of the holiday holidays they travel by rail as many people as possible.
According to today's announcements, from the beginning of the operation until 13 hours at BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. in Budapest Airport, the four-hour station is organised by the Committee of Workers' Associations in the Energy Industry of LIGA, to the 2-, respectively, 2-8h-hour work stopped by the Committee's Association of Pediagists and the Democratic Committee's Association of Pediagists.
The association of Hungarian doctors will be held all over the country, the Democratic Committee of the Workers' Association in Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which is part of the Cooperation Forum on Trade Unions (SZEF), will organise a two-hour surveillance event.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government withdraws the proposal for a health insurance reform and submits a new concept to the public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating the income is gradually introduced from next year.
Third, to ensure that early retirement for the relevant employment sectors is included in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the independent union of railway employees (VDSZZZ), which falls under the association of the team of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economics and Transport concerning railway routes, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
The Hungarian Guard's action, based on support for the movement of Jobbik Magyarországért in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Institute of Political Capital has immediately increased in several respects the political risk of Hungary and the whole area.
The "risk warning" developed by the company states: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "by focusing on the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-Roma population of Hungary, it may already come to violent ethnic shocks in a short time".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably aimed at triggering such an action - the research institute supplies.
As it says, all of this can be explained by one of the biggest disadvantages of Hungarian political representatives: "The public debate on the Roma issue has left representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Medan dispute."
This problem deepens, makes normal dialogue impossible, reinforces extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - a judicial institution.
In addition, the Hungarian Guard's activities, according to the Institute of Research, are influenced by the great attention of domestic and foreign media "to a significant extent by the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to belief in the stability of the country and its democratic success".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-reform groups, which has been gaining ever greater publicity and coverage since the fall of 2006, is that since 2007, several organisations have been created in Hungary, which themselves are called "national defence companies".
"The common picture of these groupings is that they themselves define themselves as civil society, while they openly declare - and armed - their members' readiness to carry out defence tasks (in the case of life catastrophes, attacks by the authorities, violations of order), in addition to pointing out the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
He further notes that this is all done in a way that seeks to pack up the most diverse political efforts made to resist society's political and civil rights.
The emphasis on civilisation and the form of society in the case of these collections is therefore not only to avoid legal interference with judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is also an increase in risk from the point of view of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to apologise to the Hungarian Guard for their own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this can have an impact on the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a single phenomenon, so political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As it says, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation announced in August 2007 the ultra-regulatory Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roman disturbances that exploded in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used it to establish a guard with the aim of the organization being "national armed".
In the past 17 years, according to it, there has been a "cican terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained ineffective and fragile, recalls the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative has led to a heated debate by the Bulgarian public.
As it continues, the increase in the risk of ethnic strikes signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they create their own guard on the mark of resistance.
Since the current activities of the Hungarian Guard show similarities with the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own home armor, we can read in the warning of the risks created by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, research director of the Institute of Political Capital, asked the press office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year and if they find anything that might affect the change in risk, they inform the public opinion, such as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Celebrations aren't free everywhere.
In Hungary, the days of the holidays are precisely defined by the law, and it has become a common practice to move around the holidays, which awaits us many times next year.
In the European Union, even in the Americas, holidays are not the same.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
Workdays of peace usually weigh on church holidays or on significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is free work - for the New Year in order for people to rest after Silvestra.
During the year, we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The National Festival is March 15, 1848 and October 23, a memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrate the founding of the state, May 1st, November 1st and November 2nd, we remember the dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day Christmas, Easter and Easter.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays are seldom on the weekend, the practice of moving a working day in cases where we would be working only one day before or after a free holiday.
The price for the weekend is, however, that we are staying at the workplace and in school last Saturday.
The day that the celebration immediately precedes or follows it, we have worked out that for years he has been adjusting in a special statement by the Minister of Labour.
The law applies equally to all employees and their employees, to public employees and to persons in public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or in view of their determinations, even on working days.
This year, only around the end of the year will change the working order: from December 24, life in the country will gradually be stopped, because according to current experiences, most people between Christmas and Silvester are "working" before or using the saved holiday.
Next year a few of our holidays fall in the middle of the week, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
First, the calendar will be changed around the work weekend so that the workers can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be the working day so that it can be the opposite of Friday, May 2, on the rest day.
The next move relates to the holiday of October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will work instead of Friday 24.
At the end of the year, however, it will be possible to take place in the symbol of the holidays, as from December 24th they will have almost everywhere in the holiday, although Silvester is on the Wednesday.
Six scary little things you can piss off your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that we don't even notice before: they're all "breathing" every day at the workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or you will put on gloves and unclear situations that others may be angry with, you will deliberately avoid.
Types.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
That's why you missed your wallet?
In a better case, he's sorry and he's trying to fix it, he'll call the marketing department, and he'll say he forgot to send the message (this is a less common solution).
The most common thing is solved once apologise.
Before it comes to embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you could do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and try to avoid it wisely.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than getting used to writing, office needs or your phone, and they're not there.
Remember you put yourself on the dishwasher table yesterday, but it's gone in the morning?
Or have you discovered your pens on one of your colleagues' tables that you thought were lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without your permission, or they'll be right to you to take care of them.
Do not take cover or adhesive paper from your office, because it may be unpleasant when you get there early, and you will need it immediately.
The jokes about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the spreading of the cages.
Who, who, what was he doing with?
Where and why?
Don't let anyone know your news about the private life of colleagues!
If some of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence do not hesitate with your colleagues, even when the others know about him.
No reason to report your absence?
If you call the office and with a call for strong headaches you report your absence because it's not good for you, or you're saying that you'd rather rest today, you think that your work, the urgent tasks and the work they have for a certain time will have to do for you someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work, or that something may happen that you will have to stay home, report it so that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absence until the second day.
Consumption, Hygiene, Telephoneing
Are you ashamed of your work, which will drive you out of the back of your colleagues?
Were you reluctant to witness a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not interrupt your employees by using, singing, loud talk (over their heads), or assging, unsteady gossip, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disruptive even when they're not just banned from a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming me for the second mistake?
If there is something wrong or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame the other for your forgetfulness!
Don't respond to any chaos in the office and the sound colleagues!
Admit it if you're wrong and someone's paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask how you can put things right, fix the trouble!
Do you feel at the office too much at home?
Heats and shoes: comfortable clothes at home, but not fit in the office!
Don't wear clothes for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be rude, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular dress - and if your profession requires it, it's nice and elegant!
When a person wants to succeed, he ceases to be interesting
Getting in the usual early hours.
The special melody will be heard from the radio: the sound of the mood, to which electronic effects are connected.
I'm adding the volume.
Music changes pace and adds bass to previous tone coloring, and then the female congregation joins as a true cult.
At station mr2 is a composition of a group of Zagar named Wings of Love.
Our home music life has not long been marred by a quality electronic poem.
Suddenly, though, the tape looks quite different, because you're just listening to the new Zagara album.
The appearance of Yonderboy, a few new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, the overall picture slowly changes, and although it is again in fashion garage rock with its milking into the guitar, and the domestic electropop proves that it is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pétikosteli and he also played in Yonderbo's band, until he finally – perhaps because two dudes don't get into one card – he left his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which connects elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to penetrate until he was invited to compose film tracks (e.g.
film Ference Töreka "Szezon").
His formation, at the beginnings of smaller clubs, was known to the wider audience after the magazine wan2 organized their first albums from 2002 among the 50 most important household boards and announced Zagar in Yonderboie as the only domestic development actors that could also be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "in the course", although of course no one asked if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The chapel reacted to what it was like: it made a new, better album.
The currently released album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths, although the same name is trying to create a bond with the initial flights to Pétikosteli.
It is a single verse from the composition of the older Balázse Zságera chapel.
A link to etheric, flying would be in place, but next to the etheric breath of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend of time - the louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, presented himself as the prime minister of the board in the Millennium Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Pet·fi, which has played the last time from morning to evening popular music, we started to play various tunes of Wings of Love composed by six domestic singers ("underground Divas").
So it's all right (?).
The portal hvg.hu told Balázse Zságer.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, the question is offered, how much remains what you are playing, district music?
Balázs Zságer: Definition of border music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two different sets of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and that's just how it can happen just for sale, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop composition can come from an honest internal need.
This spirit also works in the manner it is accepted, regardless of language and state borders.
Hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience towards your music?
B. Zs.: In a foreign country, especially from us to the west, light music has a larger tradition.
There's not only teenagers and people going to the concerts for 20s, but also older ones.
Much more is being followed by changes in the light music that are going on around them, because they also consider it part of a contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how much your music listens to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling that our concerts go as far as possible.
But we never made music for the market.
We don't have music for a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public can be played at concerts where mutual influence is already in place, but it is hidden only in in inconvenient changes at the moment.
Still, I noticed that when a person wants to please the audience, from that moment on, he's stopped being interesting.
Hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow Yonderboie's example?
He works alone, and he's built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We're not actually going his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain.
We are more team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it did not prevent our work from being compared to the Yonderboy compositions, but several of us separated from his band and gave up the other way.
Hvg.hu: In the top of the station mr2 Pet·fi the composition Wings of Love got first.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this composition.
Have you, of course, opened up with a wider range of styles?
B.Zs.: We shouldn't have planned to write a hit to sell the board to.
It's more about that song.
We thought of it as the finals of the album, which we tried to relax the previous sound orgy and the more complex themes.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then the idea came to put together this collection of soloists from home music scenes with a good voice.
So this six - year - old congregation - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enik年 Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was put together, which we then crossed into the Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: That's exactly what you meant by the song, or did girls make up something about it?
B.Zs.: For a long time, the building existed in an instrumental version, when the material came to the board, we thought that there would be something else to do with this collection.
After the chords, he fought to add a song to it.
That night, I sang to him a song that girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost suddenly and terribly spontaneous.
I remember how it came back to life, but of course, it took Divy.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so energetically.
Hvg.hu: As on the desktop, the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have solos (except Jude Jay), they don't have their own roles, they sing all together and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't just support their songs.
They also stood in the back of the display.
Is that intentional?
B.Z.: The fact that they stood in the back was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to split the solo roles is the opposite of what we're thinking.
And this composition is that we forget about our ego a little bit, which is where it belongs, and that we just let those wings raise their wings of love.
I wanted this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born, to feel the others.
Hvg.hu: With which was the most work?
B.Zs.: During the composition of the music, even with one, harder pieces occurred rather during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work the grooves, then everything pretty slowly found his place as in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which composition from the new board is your favorite?
B.Zs.: It's still changing by concerting and I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous broker risked billions of minorities
Traitor defiant.
This is what the French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the foreign commercial bank, calls his charming employee Jeroma Kerviel.
She came for him with five billion euros in her mouth.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to settle his colleagues and certainly could not.
Unlike all large banking houses, he's been able to solve the mortgage crisis in the US market in the early years.
"It's spiritually weaker," sounded out of the mouth of his superiors who sent the police to him.
As is true of Kerviel's statement by the French media, for example, Le Monde's diary, it was the man who had profits from his sales of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis is not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in a statement.
In summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
That's what the opportunity has felt since the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to show that so-called sub-prime mortgages provided to low-copy clients or those who had problems with payment in the past would have problems.
This crisis had no effect on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and set it right.
At the end of the year, his profit dropped to 1.6 billion euros.
"Since I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't leave anything to himself.
In the entire investigation, he admits that he faked the records so that it wouldn't come to him.
He even managed to fuck the boss, even though he was beginning to be interested in his business with the Eurex stock exchange.
The risk was gained
He was afraid he'd come after him?
Not anymore.
"I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy it."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to develop gradually in his position.
He joined the General Society in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later he was an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a single broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he'd never make as much as the others.
"I already knew in my first interview in 2005 that they were paying for me.
For my education and also for professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But soon after the show, the first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he made a half-billion-euro reduction in London's bombings.
And it was a release mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we'll leave you.
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses knew all about it, or they knew it.
"As long as I made money, my eyes were closed."
But then the morning came at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to steal it.
When he got to work Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that it was worth five billion euros.
How did they find him?
He became a suspect for his vacation.
"I've only picked four days in the last year.
A broker who doesn't have a leave is a broker who doesn't want someone to look into his records," Kerviel closed.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government's ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount that can be obtained by the Czech Republic from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns will come from seven operational programmes in the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation programme.
The biggest money, up to 150 billion, will be heading for transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds available from the Czech Republic.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be managed by 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Business and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain funding for innovation.
Companies should receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In today's waste of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in the newly adopted countries.
Twenty-year sentence for the representative of Nicaragua confirmed the court
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday a 20-year penalty for the former president of Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a financial fraud of $100 million (unless the amount of 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a domestic prison on his wharf near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the head of this Central American State from 1997 to 2002 returns back to the network, it is not clear according to the AP agency at this time.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérezová will now be in charge of the prisoners, whether they let the Germans serve his sentence at home or travel to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Germany that he regularly transferred government money to a foreign company in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the account actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of these money then ended up in the fund that Germany founded on financing its election campaign in 2001.
So we got the budget approved.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional for?
It is the first budget prepared by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without support for the opposition.
This year, he was still supported by the ČSSD because he was prepared by the Minister of Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the Russian debate before the vote on the government's mistrust, nothing dramatic has been done this time.
This traditionally viewed, although most influential, photograph was approved by the law in peace.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget item, whether or not someone likes it.
The budget is a major part of the policy, but it is a secret behind the powerful opposition of the government.
This is a media thank you, and that's why he pays much more attention to the media.
Politics is much more interesting to the public than hard numbers.
The state budgets in the past socially democratic governments have suffered from three deficiencies that this is not able to resolve at once for 2008:
The first is a high share of compulsory, so-called mandate expenditure, which is not only income, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent "coalic" ČSSD and KSČM last year.
The second of these is the lack of management as a result of the insanity of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This one's public and relatively under control.
Time-bombing, however, is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many elderly people have been able to obtain other investment resources, in addition to money from taxes, fees, and loans from the bank, often disbursements of bonds that were disproportionately owed to their employees.
In recent years, they have been able to pay these debts for the mass sales of energy and other distribution networks from the state of privatisation.
They don't have this source anymore.
If we just stick to official and verifiable facts, we'll find out that:
Our economy has been going on for several years, just like the rest of the world, a growing phase, which is constantly choking the ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state still owed more.
The other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our republic.
It's a huge shame, especially to the previous governments.
We belong among countries that are at least at global level at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs that have, unfortunately, been completely absorbed in huge dimensions in recent years.
Even though some of the foolish populist expenditures approved this year before the elections were abolished, so that in the near future it would not be possible to move the threshold of retirement and pension reform, then in fact any policy in this country will end and anyone will rule in that way.
In short, it can be said that government policies will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the money spent on pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the publication of normal expenditure by mandates.
The planned deficit of 70 billion per year for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments did not manage over the past ten years as much as they could.
If we really do not want it to happen that only officials will be made out of government policies, then we need to be patient and encourage this poorly strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and fees, to prepare for further reform laws.
Only those can achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
In the currency market, this will make more than a hundred billion dollars through auctions.
In these auction banks, they prefer interest rates that are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $24 billion to auction, and the next $440 will then access the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first after the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of each country agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest economic difficulties, which is the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," Bernard Baumohl, of the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in his report to customers.
"The coordinated actions of central banks have reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to fifty per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already made $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what else can follow when they decide on this process," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are afraid that if banks have difficult access to loans themselves, they will prefer to lend to their customers as well.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to a recession with possible impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks thus decided after not being able to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money to the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about borrowing money, and even though central banks in the United States, Canada and Britain had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another decrease in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not think that the central bank's move will contribute to the recovery of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, which is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Eco-debate is incredible
Global climate change is most likely to harm developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now taken place at the UN's final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he stated that ecological debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference, which creates a strange mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that binds it and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is only a firearm of words which is a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President, in presenting his book, stressed that her theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed satisfaction at the fact that the book appeared also in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet only with the cartoons of my opinions."
Now, then, the interested ones can read his unimaginable position.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but, in his opinion, he has enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic who is able to monitor and assess professional conduct, has experience in statistics and is also a national economist.
The main conclusions of the book also indicated that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus on global warming among all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man with experience with totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On the questions before him, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their use".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn't exchange 600 thousand people.
Six hundred thousand drivers have passed the deadline and have not been able to exchange an old driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for an exchange to be made by the authorities until the end of the year.
The Ministry is afraid, however, that after New Year's time, they would be released on the road of a static driver without a valid authorization.
According to the authorities, the certificate has not been exchanged mainly by those who don't want to drive anymore.
While the municipality is reporting a sharp decline in the interest in the exchange of drivers, the authorities in the metropolis are covered by requests and the interest in the exchange of the ticket increased this week.
The Magistrate delivers about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting on the front.
In Prague, the driver's license hasn't changed about 140,000 drivers yet.
The exhibition of the new exhibition takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to request an issue within a short period of five days.
In such a case, the driver will charge five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not reach the end of the year and drive off the road without a valid driver will be threatened by the ice-cold threat.
The offender will pay up to two thousand crowns.
But a cop can solve a crime and make a deal.
In the case of administrative infringement, the fine shall be paid to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, he could have been punished by the councillor and a man who would not go anywhere.
He may have paid 30,000 crowns at the time.
The Ministry has previously called on the authorities to be mild and to have the highest of a thousand koruna.
According to the spokesperson for transport, Karl Hanzelka, but the tens of thousands of sentences do not threaten anyone.
The driver's license is based on the evidence that people can decide whether or not they want it.
It's not a civil certificate that everyone has to be valid.
People who don't want to drive should give up a driver's license.
It shall be taken away or sent by mail to the competent general authority.
By the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be paid.
But motorists have to exchange other types of driver's licenses gradually.
People with evidence from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the certificates issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the penalties for detectives co-operated with Berdich
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, who are accused of having a criminal relationship with David Berdy's gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
With the definitive validity of this decision, the Supreme Court of Prague decided to reduce the penalties by one year and two years.
Originally threatened the Prague Crimes Committee's detectives 14 and 12 years old.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the present decision, it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdich is also accused in this case, but he is only waiting for the initial verdict.
In other cases, however, he has been punished in a total of more than 16 years.
She can't get any more.
In January, in particular, the Supreme Court acknowledged the participation of 19 people who were guilty of robbery, and today the Supreme Court has decided to appeal 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' complaints from the start of the investigation refused to accept the case under construction.
According to the Central Senate, police officers, after agreement with Berdich, transmitted information from the police sources to criminals, covered individual thefts and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
Gang gave up 30 percent for Opava and Konjārík for it.
The complaint concerns gang criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the thefts often suffered by victims of serious health damage, but also the abuse of the authority of the public agent and illicit weapons.
At home visits, the police discovered illegally held guns, steel cores, laser detectors, or self-adhesives.
Gang was accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the silent testimony of 20 men in this trial, the courts have been duly found guilty of other Berdych thieves and a number of other people.
Other men from around Berdych are still in trial, some of the cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main distinction has so far been avoided by Tomáši Jótov and Maroši Šulejov, who live in an Irish prison, waiting for a final decision on their release for accession to the Czech Republic.
Children exchange account: 12 million
For the replacement of the babies in the womb, the lawyer of Igor Veleba's damaged families wants 12 million crowns, plus judicial expenses, after the hospital.
For each of the three million mothers, for the two million fathers, and for the millions of children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondrej, therefore, disagrees with Veleby's proposal.
"We reject such a requirement, it is very high," he said after today's discussion.
"But in order for us to make an opinion on the counter proposal, we need a searchable judgement that the counter-party has been able to draw up.
We'll find out if he's got any value at all.
But we are holding back in the view that it will be in the statistics for all," he stressed.
According to him, there should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablonov's family wanted a million crowns each month when she didn't raise her biological daughter.
Velebov served as the basis for the negotiations on the compensation of the expert judgment, which was prepared for him by the Faculty of Hospitals in Prague-Motole.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered from psychological injury and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by men, even though they were struggling with the rumors that the replacement of newborns was not forbidden.
Women are again worse off with the current trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, Veleb's content has been reduced.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by the nurses in the Tribune on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermákov to Pribyslavic and Veronica to Libora Brožov and Jaroslava Trojan to Jablonov.
Heitman Vysočina Milos Žstrčíl handed over each of the 100,000 crowns of the family at the end of October in return for the expenses they incurred by the failure of the Tribune Hospital, which the country is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by the law on liability for damage.
In the event of a doubt, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they may request the aid of the founder.
The courts have so far granted people relatively low compensation, sums have been calculated according to the tables in the order of the statisians, with the exception of millions of crowns.
Police came to the kingdom of Valash
Bolek Polivka has lost the argument about the sign of the Valash Kingdom.
According to the judge of the island court, he first used the marking of the King of Wales, but the project built a long-term work of the team around Tomáš Harabis, who worked with the actor.
The soup didn't take part today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably doesn't end and the client's calling.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic in the popularity of Bolka Polivky," said Polivkov's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, all of us in the words of the kingdom of Valash are equipped with just actors and comics.
He has the same opinion as Harabish.
"There's almost a decade's work behind us.
Looking for money and thinking about actions," he said.
He thinks they're the cause of the money dispute.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something to do with it.
They want to parasiticize on our work," he added.
Liquefied business
According to the court's designation, the Welsh King first used Polivka in his television series.
In 1993 she was crowned by the actor Radoslav Quickorich.
At that time, however, it did not involve the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came with the idea of issuing waals.
Out of the initial recession, trade and lucrative business activity was excluded, on which Harabiš was linked to the establishment of the Kingdom of Wales.
In 1997 Polívka agreed with the introduction of his name and signature in the passports and even offered their holders a discount when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also stated that Harabish had only used the bare idea that Polivka had published in his management for his business purpose.
"The Popularity of Boleslav's Seeds of the Valash Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, who devoted themselves intensely to him.
The cooperation today continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized official coronation in Vsetina for Polivka.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polivka and Harabiš, which have led to the meeting of the "King of Boleslav I. elected for the furt."
The leader's role in the kingdom was then captured by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the queen's mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabiše and his company, which he rejected today.
Clearly, it could bring Harabish's next-dwelling throne and half of the princess's.
A new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to tell the details and the time.
"We don't want to make it.
It should be something like a king's ride to Slovakia.
The king should be released for a certain time.
Mr. Polivka can join in," Harabish added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: misleading assumptions
Actually, I've never fanned a lot of Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not much, the quality of handling, handling, and also the products would be marked as a secondary leak.
But the market is now the successor of Peugeot 207, and the one is much better.
And the van called SW is still a bit further, and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space on my head in the backseat.
This is already the end of the complaint, because the bodywork of the van means that there will be no two-metre lengths in this direction.
The World’s Summer
I'm going through the interior very quickly so I don't get over it.
It's a complete design, where I have the only leak to the poor middle tunnel.
Here I'd appreciate something more designer invention when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and you're there when we could complain about short seats or sweats.
Side management has also improved significantly against model 206.
As far as space is concerned, there's an increase in body sizes here.
Then, in the van, there's already a lack of room above the head.
Cached
So the main one on these cars is his trunk.
I have to assess it as very well accessible (and this thanks to the opening back window) and as properly consistent.
The deaf spots are equipped with restraint tyres that are the ideal compromise.
It doesn't interfere, it can stretch out, and then it'll keep even harder objects.
But let's stop together over the volume.
It is based on the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is more than an average value against competition.
However, not against the most sold vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic - Bad Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of juveniles, then we'll find that Peugeot is left with a lot of 52 liters.
This value is to be considered as a critical value on a vacation abroad or when loading a coach.
But if I were to raise the positive, I still have to mention a completely flat floor after the second row or very low thresholds are assembled.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a furnace quadrilateral with a capacity of 1,6 l with a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that's how it's supposed to look like a sixteen-year-old who's chasing a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she's having a little consumption, and she's mostly pulling.
If I compare it to a period of damage that sometimes acts as if it had a scratch on it, I can only be excited about it.
The pricer will say
The price of the car is not human.
However, we must remember that we were testing properly equipped cars with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a super-twenty for 329 900 CZK will still go away.
Our aggregate is 410 900 CZK, which is enough.
Tested Premium equipment will then bring the equipment for another 80,000 CZK designs.
But we still had the main airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic steering, electrical control of the rear windows...
It's just the car stands all over 531 900 CZK.
That's a lot, but count the extra equipment at Fabie and you'll get to a lot of similar numbers.
So there's nothing left but to decide for the badge.
The integration of Slovenian pupils in British schools is not possible
In British schools there are children from Eastern Europe, and local residents are concerned about further development of local schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far been an obstacle to a number of obstacles.
The British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the indigenous population are increasing in violence.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools well illustrates the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants are beginning to take place.
The jokes, the jokes, and the fights between the pupils were also transferred to the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham the police kept a Slovenian woman who had iron-tighted a ten-year-old kid.
She's guilty of defending herself from being assaulted by racists.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two naked girls on a Slovenian immigrant.
The men's girls reportedly honored the racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy jumped out on a bus stop and started swimming on us.
When I told him to let it go, he turned his apples and frogs on us, and then discovered his ass," she described another unpleasant incident for The Times mother of Slovenian students.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even marked disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight against survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
In Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks who have headed for work here.
A crowd of 30,000 Slovenian students then visits British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Whatever you're expecting from your vacation, it can happen to you if you choose the right way.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fisherman.
Palms and all inclusive with cupboards offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and opium cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it in a fuller and richer bill.
Only on one island but you will find much more and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the heritage of their America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eyes ever saw.
Havana became the warehouse and translation site of the treasures that the Spaniards in the Americas have laid and transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the end of 20 years.
He let him build one of the heads of the American Mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (particularly for the ban) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall houses grew, and after the widespread storms, cars that belonged to the religious symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paula, a piece from Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures to show business stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Havana Bodeguit, you can leave your autograph as well.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you are being served with cocktails according to your wishes.
And those 50-year-old cult cars are driving after Havana by now, because once imported jugs and fiats in that salty and wet air have long been blown away.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part of it, is much appreciated, yet there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments as there are.
Other places also turn into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since travel brings so much money, its development has green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadera, on the coast of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another librarian, which is unique in the world and is particularly appreciated by the train drivers.
A third of the scattered plantations were bonded to sugarcane by narrow wheels of steam and motor trains.
Their car park hasn't been renovated for decades, and so there are machines that work elsewhere in museums.
Where to go?
Most of the visitors in Cuba are not mined.
And whether it's Varadera or Havana you don't have to write down too much.
I just hope to remind you that in Hemingway's neighborhood already mentioned, it's a museum and whoever likes this writer shouldn't be allowed to leave.
Vinjoles Valley One of Cuba's most picturesque corners is Vinóles Valley in the west of the island.
The plant grows from the armory floor.
Possible, armed homoles and rocks rise sharply from the bottom of the valley and in their dunes the fertile ground has been captured, making even the giant ladders covered with dense growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is growing.
You can meet with its final form if you visit any of the Havana factories for the manufacture of dolls.
Perhaps someone will find it interesting that Major Zeman was involved.
Trinidad
The ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him a trade with slaves and sugar.
Wealth turned into the beauty and permanence of a small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, particularly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountain of Escambray, is so remote that in the 50th century, there was no road there that country would connect to the rest of the country.
She helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and that's why it didn't happen, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time on the Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón Beach, or the Sugar Valley.
The evening is then to go to Casa de la Música, which lives after seven and the music in it is quiet over the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is some of the most beautiful on the island.
The Dozasurist's opinion is already affecting the road itself.
Both the roads leading up there with the Guantanama have to overcome high mountains and the members of the mountains and pass through a nature that human activity has hardly noticed.
The eastern island of Cuba has written UNESCO thanks to its unspoiled nature on the list of world heritage.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus cross (in fact it was created a hundred years after Columbus sailing) and from the hill where the castle stands and today's Hotel El Castillo, there are several tables mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, dolls, about Mount Sierra Maestra, about the Gulf of Pigs and the Island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropican cabaret, about the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobra, about the sanctuary, about the African religions that recognize the descendants of some of the slaves, it would be possible to describe many pages.
But, as it's called, it's better to see once.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, tough Americans
Few soldiers and lack of equipment are affected by the United States during the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should plan a specific plan for the next year.
The Mission in Afghanistan does not go on as expected, with representatives of countries with units in the southern part of the country in Scotland.
In addition to increasing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating States are today discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Minister of Defence Robert Gates, called NATO units for greater activity this week, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the Afghan government's authority and strengthening development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is important, but military power can be only one part of the solution.
The next is to allow citizens to start further economic and security development themselves," said British Defence Minister Des Browne, BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activities of the Afghan rebels are, according to the data of the US Army, the highest in the last five years.
The number of acts of violence rose by 27 per cent last year, in the southern Helmand province even by 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies reached the same limit in the organisation and equipment units.
They specifically request other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense today, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke.
"I have no joy in what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's little," said Reuters De Hoop at the end of the class talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
In recent months, disputes have also been raised between the participating countries as to whether all the allies are taking the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its commitment.
"The Germans have relatively large representations in Afghanistan.
However, they are deployed in areas where the minimum of violence and the demands of war on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British Sun's bullfighting letter marked German soldiers as Lennox.
"Afghan fighters are discovered: Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in material, supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild went against the attack and printed a picture of the British unit in the race fight in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to billion in 2009
In each Czech Republic, there is a government debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Total debt came to the end of September at 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic fell to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In nine months this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has been reduced by 13.4 billion crowns.
So today the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
In every Czech country, there's a debt over 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we seem to be able to overcome the billion kroner borders until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and billion crowns," said Patria Finance David Marek, an analyst for iHNed.cz.
Similarly, the analyst Next Finance Vladimir Pikora says: "To exceed one billion we could get in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Overdue debt
The State debt constitutes the central government's debt and, above all, creates a accumulation of state budget deficits.
State debt is financed by depositary notes, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns so far.
This year's foreign debt has grown by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
So-called state trading debt at the end of September reached 803.3 billion crowns and decreased by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The state debt average was increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt for the first to the third quarter increased by 13 per cent, which is indeed a lot of how economies are doing.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly in bonds, where 20 percent is growth.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it will deal with what it will do when the pension reform is here," Pikora's data commented.
Better than expected
The strategy for financing and managing public debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The share is mainly a government deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
It is also about the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of income, the financing of state bonds for 43 billion crowns and the European Investment Bank's loan of 1.8 billion crowns.
A woman is to be delivered to the court in Chartum today for giving the name of a walnut bear
The British teacher, convicted in Sudan of violating Islam, was sentenced to fifteen-day imprisonment on Thursday night by one of the Charter Tribunals and convicted, as her lawyer stated.
Britka was accused of having let six to seven-year-old pupils give the lye bear's name Mohamed despite the fact that any representation of the prophet to Islam is forbidden.
It was a detailed sentence of injury.
This British 40-year-old teacher, acting at the University of the High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested at home on Sunday and charged with the insult of Islam and the rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Law, after several pupils had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact already in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class lye bear.
"There will be eight names in children's mouth, including Hasan, Abdulah and Mohamed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
After voting in the class, 20 of the 23 children finally choose the most popular name Mohamed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all it is a very expanded Christian name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label with that name, but it was a problem in the very vision of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that might be offensive to any religious faith: "I'm only sorry that she asked the children to vote for some name," according to him only "innocent doubt".
Such an opinion is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their students" and add that "never talk about religion in class".
Remember, the second most frequently assigned Christian name in the United Kingdom, Mohammed is written in 14 different ways in English.
This Christian name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them toys?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations, this centre in Vienna did not reach agreement on the future status of the province.
It's not finally a success.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth round of talks in Austria on Wednesday morning and at the same time, without being able to overcome different views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is policing that both parties have not been able to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to keep the peace of his commitments and were ready for dialogue even after the end of the negotiations.
"We don't expect violence at the nearest time, but we enter the difficult period," he added, "it's obvious that the situation is tense."
The negotiations will end on 10 December.
The Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last be exported to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90% of Albanian-speaking populations are made up, could be shown in a clearer light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexandr Bocan-Charchenko are going to deliver their message to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and at the same time the last round of negotiations since the United Nations, in August this year, has entrusted Troy with the new negotiations.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the end of the talks on 10 December.
The Russians who have already blocked the independence of Kosovo in the UN Security Council, on the contrary, insist that the negotiations continue after this very deadline.
"Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of international governance, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the EU's sole sovereignty.
Pristina declares that, in the event that the Security Council does not decide for its benefit, it is prepared to declare its independence unilaterally.
Béléhrad takes on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," said the President of the Kosovo government Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden Hotel, where this "opportunity was held since Monday."
Hashim Thaci, the former Kosovo Albanian leader and future prime minister, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the plan of autonomy presented by the Belgrade "was part of the past that led to murders and deportations".
"Dominic effect"
On the contrary, Serbian President Boris Tadic believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the unilaterally declared independence of the province.
In particular, Belgrade is concerned about the "dominant effect" in the area, which is still unstable as a result of wars for independence in the 1990s.
"But it doesn't mean for Serbia," he said, "it's impossible to compromise."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be taken exclusively by the Security Council in which its Russian association had the right to veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia the only solution from the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"This conversation lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word of status will be the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence from Albanian-speaking citizens were to occur, "by agreement" would be done with the West.
Bush on the Israelis and the Palestinians reached an agreement
At the start of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland, which was announced by US President George Bush, the Israelis and Palestinians finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He clarified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate opening of negotiations with the intention of always resolving a 60-year dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything he could to help them conclude the peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush declared and recalled the obligations that both parties have taken from the "road map" to the peace that they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian self-government led by Abbas had the aim of "closed a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues".
This declaration includes three questions that are at the heart of the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future frontiers of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in the territory of the present state of Israel in 1948.
Abbas took note of the words of the President of the United States and stressed that the following negotiations were "total and thorough" and that all aspects of the solution were affected by the reference to "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, etc.".
Then Olmert came to the court, who expressed the view that the following negotiations should be "right and continuous" and that it should "be established to be closed in 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as a deadline for the realization of his "two-state vision", the Palestinian and Israeli, which exists next to him.
Saudi Arabia has announced that it has accepted a commitment from Bush in this sense even before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which Israel offers peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories banned for war in 1967, including eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", judges Prince Saúd in an interview that provided an Arab speech diary to protected Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from black chronicle, the official version does not agree with what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first survey of the French State Police Inspectorate General (Inspection General de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car went on Sunday shortly after 17 hours on Louise-Michel Street in the village of Williers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in operation, but was on the watch and traveled at speeds 40 to 50 km/h, had no side lights turned on," explains the police source.
The green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unregistered, and therefore without the permission to drive in public communications" (read below), run by two young people without access, ran "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the left-hand side of the police car after it didn't give the message priority," said one police officer.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (broken front, broken front glass, broken bumpers) is a witness to the speed of the attack.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) had responded very quickly to Marie-Thérèse de Givry and had announced yesterday that IGPN had commissioned the investigation of "ingenious killings and the failure to provide help to persons in danger", which at the same time was taken over by the department of the department of de la súrété publice du Val-d'Oise (Directorate of the National Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three witness incidents, which were under investigation on Sunday night, confirmed, according to the office, "the version of the police, because the mini-tourist approached them quite quickly to the left."
Some noise, no doubt caused by a third of the hits on the ground yesterday, showed that both vehicles were locked up until the police car was able to freeze.
Vehicles were secured and passed by technical expertise.
The two victims had a drink on their bodies yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday at Williers-le-Bel, people were quickly spreading rumors that the police were supposed to leave the scene quickly without providing the first aid to two young people.
IGPN, in all caution, also had to exclude "any serious apology" from this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which it is necessary to be very careful," said the police source.
The daily "Liberation" met with an obvious witness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows then leads directly to where the accident took place.
"We immediately ran down with nurses who are the nurse in the hospital to try to resurrect them," the witness tells.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he saw the "screaming, totally scared cop.
Two others tried to raise one of the young and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with a rapidly growing tension and certainly present, the situation of young people is hopeless, police officers were driven by colleagues who, in the meantime, arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about 20 minutes after the police leave."
They also carried out a heart massage, but they're tired.
"Let no one claim that the police have failed to help young people.
These young people were given first aid.
The Hasichs arrived immediately.
Everything was done for their salvation," the prosecutor stressed.
Growth tensions in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police pressed the first demonstration since the announcement of an exceptional status by General Musharaf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under exceptional conditions were wounded by tears of gas, which, according to the witnesses, used regular forces.
The last nominations answered with stones, which injured several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were called.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and wounded lawyers.
Several of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general stand and announced a demonstration, resulting in about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were replaced on Monday morning in order to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, lawmakers received support from religious parties gathered in the political strong alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "bought a population to send flowers to the judges who stood against the exceptional state and waste to those who had sworn before the Musharaf".
"Mussaraf's promise doesn't pay."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is the direct target of the extraordinary measure announced on Saturday night.
In the next few days, the legal re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October, was to be declared.
Judge Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All that we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court's judgments," the official in The News magazine said.
The commitment of Parvíze Musharrafa to surrender the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "free" after the establishment of an exceptional state, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azem said on Monday.
It was expected that military uniforms would be surrendered until November 15th, when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the ice elections could be postponed.
In other words, the Pakistani government has also broken down the country's ongoing speculation, according to which the commander of the army had to order President Musharraf's house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancy still forms an unexpected pregnancy
This estimate includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or created in an unexpected manner.
More than one out of three (36%) is still not expected today, a study conducted by the French Institute of National d'études démographiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which in France made anticonception.
This estimate includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or created in an unexpected manner.
The different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, estimates Ined.
However, anti-conception legislation only allowed for better "fertility control", the constitution argues and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between 20 and 44 years of age has now reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight births from ten today are well planned.
One couple of five has birth even calculated for the month exactly and if possible in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of a child.
Surprising correction of the space station
More than seven hours of space work required the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair of the fragmented solar panel necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky exit to space that collected records of the duration, distance from the residential modules, the speed with which the "sculpture" was planned and the measurements imposed by the astronauts for repair.
The difficulties arose on Tuesday, while the astronauts from the Discovery ship released the Harmony module, a large military service designed to install European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is some kind of docking mollusk for modules-laborator.
But you need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the seventeenth-century module producing electricity by means of solar panels that were already on the ISS, so that the anchor at its final position.
After she moved it, the crew started disbanding the 70-metre solar panels of the module.
And in it was one of the panels that split up as a pull-on harmonica, as a result of a cable attached, damaged on the surface of a single meter.
Distortion was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally to carry out a control output on the Discovery ship, and subsequently to go to repair another solar panel whose system of rotation had a malfunction, were forced to commit to the damaged panel.
And it was exactly Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic shoulder of the ship, attached to the shoulder of the station, and made repairs.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walk) of the United States Aviation and Space Agency (NASA).
High, static, veryverse, has a very elaborate chest and a long coat.
In his 46 years, this initial call was commissioned by a doctor to "operate" the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully investigating the damage, he cut off the bad cable and fixed it to damaged sites like "dlahy".
He helped the second spacewalker, who remained close to the balancing chambers, and also inside, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, captain of the crew.
The tools that he used, namely a mine-shaped insulation device to prevent electroshocks on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "after cutting" produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely disbanded and then invented his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts used a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts were returning to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
The EADS shares weaken
The EADS shares are likely to lose at the Paris Stock Exchange after this company operating in the aviation and defence industry announced that it will have to lose 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to meet the A400M delay.
EADS has lost 4% and is now at the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21,96.
The financial group was forced to reassess its expected production results for 2007 as a result of the slowdown in the development of the A400M engine, which is the condition of the start-up flight.
The cost of reducing the delay in the deliveries of the military freight aircraft, announced in October, was "to EUR 1.2 billion to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European construction company EADS.
For these costs, EADS will be required to announce a new view of the profit before interest and tax deduction (EBIT) on the next Thursday when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also concluded that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Note that the production results of EADS in 2006 fell by 86 %, in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of the other programme, i.e. the large airport A380.
The group initially assumed that the first delivery of A400M to the French army would be made in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without a hasty expectation: Russians will mostly elect President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming this, only after the completion of a very little free pre-election campaign, its tendency to stability, to authoritarianism.
Today, three days ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced to the voters at public broadcasting stations, the content of which is kept secret.
It is from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-creme party, which, according to all, celebrates the third victory.
Yesterday, when he accepted foreign ambassadors, the president did not let anything out of him and satisfied himself with another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and want to be honest, perhaps the most transparent and less transparent elections, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it is not so far away.
They're depriving the campaign of various pressures.
The Communist leader Gennadij Zjuganov says that "they have never made such a dirty choice, not even for Jelcina."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former world's master in the chess of Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to have his lawyer's ban on visiting.
"The Russians have remained the mentality of the Soviets."
In the background of these parliamentary elections, two far more open questions are being raised:
"Who will become Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The Official Journal yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates can be represented by the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, is not able to reach out for a third mandate in line.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play in March?"
Will he be the prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of the United Russia, who elects the government and the president?
Whether it is as or not, the ruling power will win the whole race in parliamentary elections, as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have remained the mentality of the Soviets, they do not feel worthy of their fate," sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada, said.
The history of Nikolai Kopossov from the State University in St. Petersburg is a long-standing relationship: a civil society, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, is late; it is the famous common spirit behind the creation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin linked to the Patriotic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population rather than the fact that this new Patriotism was not a terror, but a certain economic blessing," Mary Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation is said to be.
The Russians today are "voluntaryly giving up their personal responsibilities", which they showed shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"What do you think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of the total number of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, a synonym for chaos.
Public opinion gives priority to stability.
In the name of stability, the Russians will also not vote for extremists.
Tamary Crédničenko's conclusion, 40-year-old professors: "What do you think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than sixty years in a credible regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which account for the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, open up to the public.
47 million archived documents stored 27 km long in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were currently only available for "humanitarian" purposes, which means individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or its authorised persons.
The eleven States entrusted with the management of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
In view of the fact that the process of ratification of this Agreement by all States is at the end, the opening took effect yesterday.
Other information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow you to examine "particularly the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of emergency workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, a number of states, including Germany, have been opposed to the making available of these nominal public documents because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the alleged homosexuality or mental injury of some of the victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or detainees compiled by the Gestape were gathered after the war for the practical purpose of finding the deported or forced work of the civilian population, giving them proof of their admission to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are making dozens of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"There is nothing new about these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
Bilateral trade between Europe and India is currently at EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, announced by the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave a green European Commission to open negotiations with India, South Korea and the Southeast Asian States. Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, however, India is, according to the European Commission, up to the ninth EU trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is a great boost to both economies" and "India is gaining better access to the 450 million prospering Europeans market," Peter Mandelson added.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, the European Commissioner explained. The Asian and European giant together annually changes "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said this week Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India meet at the 8th joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singha and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso on Friday.

The English bank raised concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the English bank announced that it intended to reduce the current concerns that the credit market conditions were again deteriorating and announced a bid of 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction for a basic interest rate of 5,75 %, an offer not usually valid for a long time.
"In an effort to ease the fears that the conditions on financial markets will be very negative at the end of the year and give banks greater security in the way that ensures their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", the Communication reported.
The Bank makes it clear that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January at a basic interest rate.
It appears that it is the first thing that BOE is pumping cash on the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
The BOE submits in its Communication that "there remains a readiness to take further measures to maintain inter-day interest rates" interbank loans at the same level with their basic rate.
The average interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on average.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6,6 %, which is the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the annual financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the English bank have been linked to the fees charged by the banks since the use of this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the development of the euro's book rate, many prefer to decide on the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more secure discretion.
UMP (Union pour un movement populaire, Union for People's Movement) and NC (New Centre, New Centre) refuse to make proposals by the Socialists (PS) on purchasing power
The UMP and the New Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the individual paragraphs of the proposal for a law on purchasing capacity, which is the same as rejecting the text.
At the beginning of the day, the text of the bill was received under the so-called socialist "neighbourhood" (a meeting initiated by a single parliamentary club) and contained dozens of measures taken by the PS Presidency on Tuesday, including an increase of 50 % of the employment premium, the renewal of collising TIPS, the transport check or the rental regulation.
In view of the fact that the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after the general debate, which took place on the occasion of an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television performance on purchasing power.
The PS Head of MPs Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will re-submit these proposals in full in the form of addendums to the amendment of the bill on finance to be discussed next week.
There's a new festival
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is establishing a new festival, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in cooperation with the Festival of the Republic of the United Kingdom by Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without a hint," said Charlie Jones from the Billboard.com C3 server.
C3 is produced by the Chicago Festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is the summer campers' target station.
The festival should be held from August 8th to August 10th on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festival organizers.
In 1989, the Kingdom’s Reading Festival attracted 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Beginning in 2002, Melvin Benn, a co-owner, also has production, licenses and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which currently has up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as "the most inspiring event", which he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvina Benna are working at the same time to give the region a festival event of European style.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to set up a festival in central Philadelphia," claims Charlie Jones.
"I talked to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the city's current leadership, we've stepped into politics, Charlie Jones adds.
"We were fortunately able to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will serve the people of Philadelphia as a result."
C3 Presents in 2005 set up the Lollapalooz festival in the Chicago Grant Park, after having emerged in 2002 on the festival stage by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The rough markets for both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are held in the city environment.
"The European model of the Melvina Benna festival is taking place in the countryside, while our festivals are taking place on green beaches in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to shape both concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the perceptions of the rural festival in Europe and the urban festival in America."
Vineland is located close to halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Obec Vineland, including the mayor, is excited to support the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed person refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, claims that "they are useful enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, a long term".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will include 80,000 people.
He says the groups have already been sent invitations, but nothing can yet be confirmed at the time the program is only printed.
"Vineland's gonna have rock cream, but music's gonna be cool there, so we can attract a wide range of spectators as much as possible," says Carlie Jones.
C3, who received the top Independent Promoter prize in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Head of Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal, when the Terminator himself...
This Conviction Mission is one of the tasks of delegates.
His mandate, however, is "politically demanding" because Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to get the Governor into the traps?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those whom they will consider to be the best," he said.
Honba for festivals
At the moment, however, Denise Turcottea is a priority for local film promotion.
She's already starting the Oskary honor.
At all the festivals of the West Coast, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or in San Francisco, it will be about presenting Quebec films, paying attention to them and ensuring that the directors provide interviews.
The dark age was a few weeks ago of good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, he will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Quebec also presented four short films and four films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is it coming at the end of the year at the marathon Stock Exchange? Experts divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors already hold their hands to expect the traditional marathon to come at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure it will come to him.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market is a positive period".
However, forecasts should not be created solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, at least in the short term, certain doubts occur in current markets."
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange has changed over the last few weeks and state that "the stock market is maintaining the existence of liquidity, which is prepared to invest in view of the missing alternatives with guarantees, especially a firm income affected by the return on quality paper, both in the long term and in the short term".
It is therefore believed that the stock exchange will have a more peaceful course, not without volatility, "particularly because it is not known the impact of the likely loss of FED (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of oil prices and the dangers of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, the head of the BPI bank in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time for a bold statement that the marathon is coming.
"There are not too many reasons for joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4 % of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
However, all experts do not have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year by something close to 16,000 points thanks to the rescheduling of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension insurance that occurs each year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be slightly different because it is believed that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the weekend at the occasion of the Constitution Day.
This analyst does not intend to influence the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching a technical level and "that is why we could observe the reflection of an index called by the US report on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst believes these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree in the selection of titles that will take care of bringing Ibex to a new maximum cat.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that this year is a series of strong titles.
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
On the contrary, Federico Oluch from Inversis Banco assures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and industry.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich this marathon if it comes to it.
"The ACS has been reinvigorating for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
cyclical consumption will be in advance in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the holiday sale period.
This expert on the other hand believes that technology will also be very good, even though there are not enough representations on this field in the Spanish market.
Five times over seven years
In the last seven years, December was only in two cases a month of failure.
A real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 was restored to 28.17 %, the December rate was 6.68 %.
We will see if 2007 will be in line with the fifth profit year (while Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in having its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred popular bank branch will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Similarly, for other Spanish entities, it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and to place on the uninterrupted opening time of its branches up to 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly ensured that it wants to extend the opening time of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the opening committees of 75 % of its branches on Saturday in exchange for the extension of the opening period by one afternoon, even if not for the public.
The results of this experience will be decisive for the Bank of Popular to be connected or not to other entities supporting the opening-up of the business period.
That's exactly the purpose of the project that got out of the Popular Bank.
Get individual customers who spend in these places behind their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, businesses and businesses from the selected streets where the branch is to be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain over about 18 months, because it is not the only thing to open new branches, but only to amend existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernises the branches already in its trading zones by adapting the customer profile in individual streets.
This complements the duration of the opening period with other features of the area of the side and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
The bank’s business manager, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it goes from six employees to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized enterprises and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as explained by Angel River.
The branches were selected in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera it seems that it was a happy choice.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 immigrants who are operated under the Mundocredit brand also have a very long opening time and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónica on the sale of mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock exchange doubles the value of his rival Anteny 3
We did it.
Mr Vasile, Executive President Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he found that the television he was driving doubled the value of his rival Anteny 3.
Only one thing said his joy: 'What I'm sorry about is that it didn't happen because we'd grow more, but because we've fallen less', he said.
And then he stressed that due to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished trading yesterday by 2.54 %.
This profit shifted their loss by the end of the year to 15,66 %.
The exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) for Vocent's participation (other 13%) thus, according to Bloomberg, is EUR 4 488.88 million.
Her competitor Antena 3, which dropped 1.52% yesterday and dropped by 40,5% from January, has a half-value of 2,193,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies that have been assessed is 3,571 billion in Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is offered because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we can do on the same market at what price and how we will assess it in monitoring.'
Telecinco announced last week that this year it was calculated that by overcoming billions of gross advertising revenues, he would become the first television channel, as guaranteed by Giuseppe Trangali, Executive President Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that provides advertising for the group.
If the forecast data were actually obtained, this television channel would record an increase of 3,6 % in the advertising turnover compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antenna increased by 1,6 % (and reached 734,4 million), while net revenues of this television increased by 0,7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors to which analysts focus is for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock market is an increased payout, which has been maintained so far: in 2006 this company, which is chaired by Alejandro Echevarria, divided between its shareholders by 100 % of its profits.
Vasile ensures that, although it is soon to be decided, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official obligation to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already raised the value of 33% of Endemolu'.
According to market analysts, at this point, the market shows a certain deterioration.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit estimates by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the explanation that the projected growth of revenue from 0,5 % to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The company's Tataj has reduced the expected Anteny 3 profit by 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Congress approved the transposition of MiFID as from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary proceedings that were concluded today by the vote of the Congress on the novels of the Senate in the draft law, the government subjugated the public hearing of the regulations that are developing the new law with a view to bringing both into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties agreed on the efforts of the MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which amends the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and supports cooperation between individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial consulting services to be provided to both specialised companies, both natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services providers (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI) that connect to a company with securities, brokering offices with securities and a portfolio management company.
In addition, the number of financial instruments operating systems is expanded by linking multi-party trading and internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stock exchangers.
The Act further obliges investment services to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risks and risk-equipment methods, and requires a list of all operations carried out to simplify supervision by the CNMV.
During the discussions in the Congress Trade Commission, several amendments were included, between which the secured claims were considered to be a "complex" financial instrument, given the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the USA with high risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to legalise the functions that can be held by the bakery in the field of economy and business management 30 years after the Royal Decree was passed in 1977, which excludes the professional functions reserved for economies.
At the same time, the Senate has organised the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as the intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading services and customer acquisition services for different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union's inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEC) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods for estimates of information that are not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily have to comply with the final data available on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes announced that November's ISC increase to 4.1% is "temporary number", but at the same time predicted that the price index will continue to be relatively high in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress' culture has clarified that "even if it is not a positive number", the Spanish inflation differential towards the monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not count with such a high increase.
"We expected a value of about 4%," the Minister of Economy introduced the information presented today.
Virgin is planning to earn 42 billion euros in three years
Since the fall of September, the Bank of Northern Rock has been in crisis and has had to withdraw from the Bank of England for emergency loans, its deposits have dropped by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At that time, the bank corrected the record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually lost confidence in customers over two and a half months, even though the government offered a prudential guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who replaces the entity's trade mark with Virgin Money, needs to obtain around a quarter of the revenues invested in British banks over the next three years, so that the remaining 18 billion pounds are achieved and thus achieves a target of 30 billion.
Richard Branson, a group of magnets known in the United Kingdom with their imaginary advertising campaigns, plans to lose 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually for advertising and marketing in order to reach its presidency.
The Bank of Northern Rock this week marked the offer of the Virgin Consortium, which forms another three companies, such as the one that gives priority to saving them from bankruptcy.
Totany Mayor arrested for alleged corrupt practices in construction
The Civil Guard today held the current mayor of the city of Totana (of the People's Party) in early hours because of his alleged involvement in corrupt practices in the construction that had been discovered this week.
There was also one of the counsellor's secretaries and the local police chief.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales in May of this year, the current human MP and until then the mayor of the village, who, according to the research sources of the TV broadcasts of Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of the whole company.
The police continue to monitor the buildings of the councils and the construction commissions, and no further arrests will be excluded in the next few hours.
In addition, a lawyer named Juan Morales, the chief suspect of corrupt practices in the construction, was accused of having been discovered at the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER, a 'lidoveck' lawyer, who had been examined, informed yesterday that he was arrested on leaving Morales' home with important documents related to corruption.
According to the sources of the investigation, it is also the subject of an investigation into Morales' alleged selection of commissions for its signature of an agreement on construction with the Galician construction company, which has been reclassified 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono accepted the offer to stand in front of the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, to President Congress
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general elections in front of the PSOE (Spanish Labour Socialist Party) in Toleda and in the event that the Socialists win general elections, he became President of Congress.
So at the press conference, PSOE secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself announced this after a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon in the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief executive of the offer to the former minister argued that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems," that this policy from La Manchy will be the candidate for the Socialist Party to the President of Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono, as President of Congress, would replace Manuel Marín, who published his decision on November 15th in the next general election and leave his active political career to fight climate change in the framework of university education.
The former minister admitted that the president of the government constantly insisted on him to return to the top policy he had left two years ago.
He further stated that as well as the citizens know who will be the prime minister of the economy if PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in "transparent form" who would chair the Congress.
If Bono achieves this function, he hopes that Snow will turn into "house of respect and never supply or scream" and that "will become more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems, unfortunately, that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak in peace and peace is Congress, the President of the Government of the Senate on one occasion interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he spoke with commendation at the address of current President Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so as not to diminish himself to what his opponents might consider to be "great."
Climate propaganda
In view of the fact that the movement against climate change is undermining the unmerciful pursuit of both those who look skeptically at his predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must show strong coherence.
Moreover, to have the leader of the movement, who is the president of the government like Zapatero, and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign "a new treaty with the planet".
This proposal makes it necessary to explain why the activity or inaction of its government has made a significant contribution to the fact that Spain leads in the European Union in the non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure in which sectors and why his government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it from doing so.
In addition, it requires him to explain to the Spanish what measures he intends to take to mitigate climate change.
Which companies will thus be damaged, which habits of the population will have to change, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays for saving the planet.
But we didn't wait for such explanations, nor do we.
Just because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are not popular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of petrol, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed to Zapater so risky from the point of view of the elections that he quickly rejected it.
In other words, it is to save the planet in such a way that nothing is lost, pure propaganda, passwords of any real importance.
Active phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And with the covenants of the earth, which he shall make, he shall make no charge of the campaign which he shall not make, nor of the assembly which he shall make, nor of the assembly which he shall make, nor of the assembly which he shall make.
If it's restricted to being just a virtual contracting party and not asking us to ride a bike and cool the wind.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained for suspicion of corruption in construction
As investigators reported, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, the "people" of José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the counsellor and one of the businessmen in the suburbs, for suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested at his place of residence and transferred to the council, where he is now located with a number of police officers who have also been sent to the Commission for construction and the City Company for the management of industrial land and apartments.
These three arrests came to the sixth, which occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during the operation associated with the re-qualification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground suitable for construction so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last election period, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are accused of a short trial by the court of the first instance of Totana.
Six of the first prisoners were brought before the court today.
According to information sources, the former Mayor of Totany and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of the real estate office, was accused of being registered today in Totana and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, lawyer and businesswoman from Viga, was arrested in Niger (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, who belonged to that group and was transferred to the following charges.
The investigation is carried out by a group for criminal offences in the construction of the Central Civil Guard Operational Unit, whose members, in addition to the arrest, also carried out eleven visits, most of which are in companies related to arrests, based in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (the province of Madrid) and Totany.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana, a well-known company owner of poultry meat products that he could serve as a mediator.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the establishment of the largest residential complex in the city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, golf courses and two hotels with "spa".
The company gained 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project had to double the settlement of a village with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, which are dedicated to support the real estate market, Conycase, which runs parking in the streets of Coruň, Venezuela and in Fernando el Católica in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
And it's happening.

Our Finnish writer sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish news of Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on November 18th, on the Thursday of the occasion when the criticism of Blackburn's book also appeared:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public debate in connection with the tragedy at school in Jokel.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his messages of work Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a school counselor responsible for the subject of philosophy, asked on Helsingin Sanomat's page to get the professors to raise a critical opinion about Plato and claimed that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the above-mentioned basic course of philosophy at secondary schools."

One colleague informs about the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the criminal law:
A. Downloading a song would be a criminal act with a rate from six months to one year.
On the contrary, if you cut a record store at a price of less than 400 euros, it is considered to be a mere breach (§ 623.1).
B. If you cut to 1000 euros in the shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than the charge (§ 234 of the criminal law).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than the charge (§ 244.1)
D. It's less important to participate in fights than changing packages.
To participate in the extremities has a rate of three months to one year (§ 154 of the criminal law) and for the exchange of compacts, the rate of six months to two years would be
(§ 270 of the criminal law).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered to be less serious than downloading a film on DVD according to § 184.2 of the criminal law.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is a vice sentencing rather than the provision of pornographic materials to young people (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, she caught someone's hand, and it's okay.

My treating doctor tells me one of his weird research articles called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Feelings that cause monthly payouts for employees depend on how many colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at Bonn University using magnetic resonance on tomography and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the leading group Viewing the neurologist of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Research workers observed that if both were successful, they received the same pay, the activation was modest, but when one received a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Appeals against the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been infuriated for eight years by the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague of Balkan War criminals.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which he took the name of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not mentioned in Spain), which follows the pace of the detective thriller from Belgrade after New York the work of the Swiss prosecutor in pursuing refugee criminals and pressure on the relevant states to withdraw the network.
What kind of insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, represents a significant expenditure that depends on various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing a suitable vehicle insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we're talking about.
Vehicle insurance is an agreement between the insurance undertaking and the insurer.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed amount of insurance at a certain amount for taking care of the payment damage in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined by different factors such as age, condition, sex, length of holding of the driving licence, type of vehicle which is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely the accident is the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons 25 years of age and women must pay lower insurance because statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their precautions.
Similarly, on the basis of checks, insurance companies have concluded that married people have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of the journey, and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The increase in the frequency of the journey is likely to increase.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose which insurance is best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for the choice of the type of insurance which, in addition to issuing the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of fifty face different disadvantages, such as a lack of management experience and a short holding of the driver's license when they want to sit secure at the affordable price.
Although it is ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
More careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks by lowering the insurance so as to obtain insurance cover for all risks but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would provide for the customer's participation in the insurance event.
"Part of the insurance compensation provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the insurance price, which will be higher than the lower it would be participating in," explains Luis Noguera, the leading leading company First Europe in Spain, online insurance intermediary.
Another option is to extend insurance to other participants in the operation so that the client will ensure against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of vehicles.
Recommendation.
If you are 20 or five years old, try to be careful and stop the accident as it is possible, because it will affect your bonus and enable you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate of the insurance company.
On the contrary, the measure is an increase in the said basic rate.
"Bonus and the baby will depend on insurance and its profits.
If the insurance company has a good year, it will be able to afford an increase in the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the 20-five-year limit, drivers are more likely to be able to get insurance, because the customer risk index is decreasing because of the experience gained.
For this reason, it is recommended that all risks be covered by insurance.
"Young people usually cannot use the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident, and not when it comes to management," the director of the European company in Spain assures and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of the event, when "the fear of the novelty has already been overcome."
However, if the client is married, but has not yet had children, it is better to take insurance against all risks if his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered as clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their exposures will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a lower insurance (which could make 300 euros) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the operation starts a third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can allow themselves to get the highest discount," said Luis Noguera.
The pensioners are recommended to cover all risks with a reduction in the insurance (which amounts to EUR 150) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is somewhat important not only because it protects the driver in the event of a accident, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a good reason for a proper study of the insurance options that we would most like to see in our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Milan point, which means osmiffinal
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the league "Champions", because for Italy it would mean being the first and in Scotland it would decide to be the first.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the procedure in the fifth remix match in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs another one to be sure that Shachtór will not get ahead of him with six points, which will play with Benfika, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, because AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the first to arrive at the thirteenth in the semifinals, in an attempt to get to the finals that are playing the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the other and decisive result at the Giuseppe Meazzi stadium seems to be most likely, even though both men will try to win because the Italians won't want to tacticalize on the home ground and Celtic knows that after the win it would be the first and provide a better place in the eighth final.
Gordon Fearan's crew could even get lost if Shachčor didn't win, but he couldn't rely on it, because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1), but won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so AC Milan players will try to destroy the night of Scotts who believe that they will suddenly get to the semifinal in the reorganized Champions League just as they defeated them in the same match in the last game of the Kaka ball in the length (1:0) after the status 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hope that they win the "rosoneri" will be the Shachtjor, for which he has the prize of victory, only if Celtic loses, both for the course of the eight finals and for the defeat of UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no opportunity to continue in the highest European competition, could achieve a third place with one victory, so to play at UEFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tour attended 20,000 people in Vancouver
Spice Girls group started in Vancouver, Canada, before 20,000 watching their first tour since it split in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver, they said that the re-connection of their group was "big".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present at a concert that also included videos that echoed the story of this group, which sparked a sensation at the end of the 1990s.
Returns and world tournaments are played at the same time as new albums that are released by the EMI in Spain, and that bring the choice of their main successful collections, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the scene of a decorated bracelet given to their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the audience that sailed GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Prior to the beginning of Victoria Beckham's performance, she said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he's thinking about.
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the 1998 group "because of disagreements between us" caused a five-year-old group to be dissolved two years later, also revealed her nervousness when meeting with reporters two hours before the introduction of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion has changed, the view of Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I decided," Chisholm said about the reuniting of a group she had released nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "the things have been balanced and we all love each other very much."
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver by Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival, an army of cattle was expecting them at the airport.
Five has a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will take part in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, it will be on 23 December.
Dealings with new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
Russia-Ukraine is currently in the process of dealing with the prices of natural gas, thus increasing the risk that Russian deliveries of this fuel may be affected in Western Europe.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is run by pipelines across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises Ukraine's gas prices, Russia will charge higher transit charges.
The previous dispute between these two last year has reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The latest dispute between Kyiv and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owned a gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge more to Ukraine because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in the course of the negotiations," said Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoli China, Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kyev led to a reduction in deliveries from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a steep drop in exports to Western Europe, which has rapidly increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks in the world, but most of them remain underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "needs to control foreign employees"
The controller said the Scottish Chambers of NHS must improve checks of criminal records in non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Control Office of Robert Black came after the foreign doctor acting in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at the Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate view of the number of foreign staff employed.
But his report stressed that the other key checks were carried out in accordance with the pattern of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Control Office was immediately interested in the June attacks on staff from outside the European Economic Area at Glasgow Airport.
Eighteen-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeep to build the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court with a videotape accused of tying up the bombing attempts in Britain.
The NHS Chamber is expected to monitor foreign staff from the point of view of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the United Kingdom before their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use the Scottish Dislosure Scotland for the control of criminal records, this agency has no power to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report by the President of the Supreme Control Authority states, in addition to the recommendations that the Commission should be allowed to adopt the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which assists employers with controls in several countries.
"Although we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they have not been carried out regularly," the report announced.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS is in many ways in line with its own policy of pre-employment checks, but also added: "Our report points to areas where the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the quantity of foreign personnel."
The president of BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said it is "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential employees of NHS who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report indicates that the current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what further value those comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Control Authority pointed out that these numbers would probably also be higher because the Commission should have had a problem identifying staff with residence permits.
The investigation also found that the control procedures introduced by NHS authorities in the fields of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reworking its policy and directive on pre-employment checks for NHS foreign workers.
Nicola Sturgeon's Ministry of Health said, "I wanted to set up this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with the Health Commissions, takes into account the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices are found in the updated guidelines for occupational checks on all personnel, including those abroad, which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division controls movie prices
Control, a life story about the loss of the singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards, including prizes for the best film.
The prices also won the Sam Riley star, who worked to the role of Curtis in the warehouse, director Anton Corbín, and in the later role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress to be a thriller.
And the German band star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting a British movie on the world stage.
Prices were celebrated in London's Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' journey to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - stood only 3 million pounds.
But he won a Dutch photographer Corbino, formerly known for his iconic album U2 Joshua Tree, two prizes - for the best regime and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another rated - because Juliena Temple film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer got the price for the best document.
For the best player, Viggo Mortensen won the card as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern Betrayal.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation based on the roles of hard guys, won Richard Harris' prize for the extraordinary benefit of the British film.
This 50th film, including Scum, Nil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is now filming another part of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of Christian Leaps.
Winston said he's proud of this price, which is named after Camelot's star and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Biffs, are awarded by the jury, where filmmakers, actors and festival organizers are held.
Between the stations and the Bif patrons are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbot.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing immediate attacks on oil plants and also on spiritual and security components.
The state television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to use rockets in the country.
The supporters of al-Qaeda were campaigning against the monarchy, the United States' allies, since 2003, from the invasion into Iraq.
The TV report announced that the cell of eight militants led by a foreigner planned an attack on oil facilities in the province of Ash-Sharqiyah.
Saudi Arabia builds a rapid response unit of 35,000 members to defend equipment from the failed al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal declaration: 18 prisoners belonged to a cell led by "expert on fire missiles", which went to the country.
She added that the militants were planning to pass eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare for the murder of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try harder to prevent Saudis from leaving Iraq to join the Al-Qaeda militants fighting the united armies and the Shishak government, the United States supported by the conservative Saudi Sunni.
Al-Qaedh militants are of the opinion that the authorities have co-opted many religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that governs the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of the leader of al-Qaeda Saúda Usám bin Ladina to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a tremendous effort of the security forces in the past... five months," said the Ministry of Interior's State TV.
A 16-member "medial cell" was also arrested in Medina, which was intended to promote "takfirian thought" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
Among those arrested there were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is perhaps looking to the future of the Earth
Scientists yesterday announced that Venus could ever be a pleasant place for life.
Data from the current European station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's own twin than it used to be.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the Earth.
These two worlds are almost as big as they are, and they're running on similar jewels, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that the conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth billions of years ago and could also be inhabited.
But the cooled glass effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and lower turn speed sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is waterless, the surface temperature is hot enough on the roof of lead and it is released by storms and winds about the force of hurricanes.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a close look at how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics of Oxford University and one of the leading Venus Express missions said: "It is even clearer why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data enables us to draw up a scenario in which Venus began as well as the Earth, perhaps with the living environment, billions of years ago."
The police kept the enriched uranium.
Kilo of radioactive material, supposedly enriched uranium, was detained yesterday by the Slovenian and Hungarian police.
The police spokesman stated that three people were detained and the material was tested.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that it could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It's still fine.
Mitt Romney said that it is not appropriate for presidential candidates to answer the question of snowflakes.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates later agreed with the debate on YouTube, in which the ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over to the decommissioned candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday 28 November were as comical as the snowflake, which asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time have reflected many of the position of the Republican Party towards elections in the next year.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose the clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time devoted to the single theme, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the most powerful Republican themes.
CNN asked the panel of undecided volunteers to turn around with a cat when they heard something encouraging: the voter recorded the tops of the agreement when the candidates talked about hard access at the borders.
The strongest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who went ahead in key rapid votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to establish the reputation of a man who was as the primacy of New York soft on an illegal immigrant.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts because he hired illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two were particularly curious when the hostages asked whether any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
The next candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressman from Colorado, managed to come up with a little bit of money on this subject.
None of these two have a chance to nominate, but both of them remain in the game, perhaps because they started beating on fire because of immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have a similar view: greater emphasis on borders, no tolerances for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with concerns about the toys of China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the gap between libertine and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other issues.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported the holding of weapons in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One secretary asked whether the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
As a result, Mr. Giuliani concluded that even though the Bible is his favorite book, it is unlikely that he will literally believe the story of Jonah and the majesty.
Another hostage wondered if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, Jesus said that he was too clever to run for the cause of laughter.
The fight remains unusually open.
The growth of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa is covered with recent success in obtaining money and the vocal joy of Ron Paul during the middle debate.
These two were reflected from the bottom, because both sides' wings are still unable to agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates joined the party very soon and convincingly with a winning report on American size in lips, marking both sides.
This time, the party is disbanded and the result is far from clear.
Labourers’ Diseases
Gordon Brown found again a trap he could fall into; his journey out remains the same.
Although it is common in British political scandals, it is not particularly spicy.
It does not seem that there would be any rules being sold, no bills in the Paris hotel were secretly paid, no extra-marriage rings would be served.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would be hanging without revealing that a wealthy businessman in four years' time was masking contributions from the Labourist ruling side of 650 000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) under the names of other people, and that the party did not declare it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the election and offended the British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by the investigation, there was hope that it would ensure a sustainable and effective government.
Instead of formulating it as much as the most embarrassing representative president of the Liberal Democrats, once the frightened Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unsecured rescue of Northern Rock's problem bank showed weaknesses in management and flawed judgment under the fire.
Badly thoughtful proposals for a change in tax law have joined companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative turmoil.
Three generals in retirement started a riot in the House of Lords; protested against military spending cuts, for they claimed that being the commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are numerous gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary - general of the laborers (and their former observer of internal discipline), has already confessed.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would be irreversibly heading towards his end.
Even so, governments can reach the point of overlap, which they see as difficult to govern.
People don't believe the politicians and they don't like them, but most people take away their disbelief when we take over a new party.
If it seems clear that some prime minister is probably not improving anything and must not be in the office for a long time, this is a withdrawal: the government is getting drunk, the ministers are starting to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one respect, Mr. Brown's position is particularly complicated, because unlike other political leaders, you can't take the position of a new gambler.
Whatever he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the accounts of the Financial Office are linked to the decisions that Mr Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in the blizzards, such as the long-term investigation into the financing of political parties caused by the "values for money", the voters can calmly conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's hostility isn't as bad as they look.
Those bastards aren't as horrible as the conservatives are doing.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was exposed to deception.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and easy brutal government.
The latest entertainment of political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says that he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
The laws against anonymous big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about the procedure of Mr. Abrahams, but did not know that he was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly interrogated; likewise, Jon Mendlesohn, the chief laborer of the money, who learned about the ominous gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not at all involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these birds, even though the main part of the payments went through until his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but he made his decision by seeking a certified instrument, the committee to investigate this matter, which was also led by the bishop in retirement and the judge.
In this case, training is not complicated.
If the law was violated, it's about the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent president independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no one for six months, and actually reforming political parties' funding.
This would require the laborers who are in difficulty to cooperate with the Conservative and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the committees - the bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The conservatives now have a good lead in the research; he has two years to get back the voters; and the only way to win is unmistakable integrity and high competence.
Carnets
Does the crisis affect the US credit card market?
When blood is in the water, naturally they begin to stir up the back of their lungs excitedly around.
Now that the American real estate market is running low, the predators have focused on the more expensive credit card market.
The analysts of Goldman Sachs say that losses on credit cards, if the underlying mortgages were infected with other consumer credit options, could reach $99 billion.
The voltage signals are visible.
An increase in the number of cases of inability to pay (for more than 30 days late payment) and the invoiced accounts (accounts considered by the supplier to be ineligible).
The bank of HSBC announced last month that it lost 1.4 billion dollars on the US consumer credit market - also due to unsolved loans on credit cards.
But he's panicked so soon.
There is still little to pay for out-of-accounts and inability to pay.
According to the rating agency Moody's, 3.89% of the rate of incapacity for payment in the third quarter was almost the entire percentage point below average.
Decreasing levels may be partially explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 amendment to US Personal Bankruptcy Laws led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcys, which make a large part of the losses on credit cards; the number of reporting (and thus the number of copies) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for the borrowers had been breached.
The sector also shows a good level of maturity, which shows how much consumers pay monthly of their debts.
And trust in securities secured by credit cards is strong, even through paralysis in other aspects of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney, from the TowerGroup research company, predicts that the volume of their emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than in 2007.
The direct routes to spread the infection between the underlying mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when borrowing loans to real estate, consumers are more indebted to credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, tend to look at the cash flow rather than the value of handling items, so falling home prices need not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of lenders.
They can even be beneficial to the lenders.
The motivation of consumers to pay off mortgages is reduced when their property value is reduced by the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards is moved up on the priority list to pay.
The card issuers will also be able to respond more quickly and more flexibly to stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the price of hand-held items.
"It doesn't happen that we'd just reassess all the loans once in a beautiful morning," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosions in the style of underlying mortgages is low, the risk of progressive weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those backseats.
British bankers admitted guilt in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their role in the fraud associated with the former financial leader Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their statement and admitted their guilt on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially blamed in seven allegations of fraud, when they were supposed to participate in the financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves on behalf of their employers -- they argued.
They were supposed to be in January before the trial.
However, during the trial trial before US interim judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former head of Greenwich NatWest companies, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on front pages for the entire two years that lasted on the issue.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation initiated at the end of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 were pointed out by Mr Fastow that he was the aim of the government's investigation of Enron's fracture.
The complaint against the bankers -- who served the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to invent a fraud together with Fastow and his former chief cousin Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner branch controlled by Fastew, who was an architect of a lot of enrontic frauds that enroned Enron in a spirited way to declare bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this sub-section zero, but our three British people knew that it actually had significant value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's share in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper a share of $250,000 in this company.
According to Fastow’s complaint, Enron wrongly informed that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
However, those 20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastov and others.
Bankers reportedly received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and the others added about 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted his guilt in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the destruction of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in prison for three years and one month in a facility in Texarkan.
All three British have moved to bailout $1 million, which has ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001 after the years of accounting tricks had no longer been possible to hide billions of debts or to show a failing speculation as profit.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion of market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enrona Kenneth Lay and former head of staff, Jeffrey Schilling, were convicted last year for their role in the collapse of society.
Schilling is in operation for more than 40 years.
The verdicts over Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were eliminated after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow Non-Power
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and a sufficient amount of fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them is interested in so many places, because it's for a close family or a firm president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream station last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of apparent consumption in the mother exhibition centre on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, its stands were built over 200 other luxury suppliers, who hoped that freshly wealthy Russians would lean on everything from the mahogany jackets made of diamond-made car switches that would not be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer took a careful look at the clear orange Porsche in the adjacent station.
"It's a nice car, but it's against us five and ten," he said.
"Russia is the second largest private aircraft market in the United States."
On the waves of oil, money is collected in the capital of Russia as much as it was in Dallas's day.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans greatly enriched and moved to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year-old listener at Davis's Russian and Euro-Asian study centre at Harvard.
The Russians are the most prominent losers in the world in the 1990s, as well as the Soviets from the 1970s and the Japanese.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for this clone.
Another place in Moscow this week was the conference of the luxury industry Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of the LVMH Group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as Russian.
(Conferences are organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the list of the richest people in Forbes magazine, Russia has 53 billion dollars in total.
In addition, the local main institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research also reported on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "cooperative" millionaires in Russia, whose total assets amount to $670 billion.
(The World Bank indicates that in 2005 15.8% of the Russians lived below the threshold of the existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of the London clergy David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are indiscriminately adjusted and men are everyone for the whole of their names."
When they went through the evening dresses on Sunday night halls, Evgenia Yumatov's one-year-old and five-year-old Svetlana Turovkov's self and their clients labeled themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who was dressed as a veteran of red carpets, with which Joan Rivers looks like a domestic duck.
The fair seemed to be focused mainly on fresh rich people, brand-controlled Russian buyers who are willing to sit down for a few hours in road traffic so that they can go through the warehouses that are circularly mixing Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fishermen, ice cream Mövenpick, quiet culinary tables, apartments in Dubai, gowns and sinks.
Members of the public could buy tickets for EUR 30 (US$44.57).
"The Russians are interested in what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt's image from hand painted blue tiles in life size.
"Of course the Russians are interested in more gold."
Indeed, the present sellers say that Russians with old money (according to the Russian measurements are 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from the flash logs to a few well-known limited editions that would never appear on the purchase fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether millions already, millions of envoys, or simple tourists, have flown the magnificence halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, announced that he sold two mattresses of heaving, cashmere and cotton, covered with gold nets, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, a sales manager of A1 Moto, who has high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company had clearly sold orange Porsche for $170 000 to the Russian billionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who is willing to adjust the luxury car that he sold three chains into cars in the style of chain straps for Rolls-Royce Phantomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporter the car bike designed for the Russian casino owner, who had the escape drawn by the Swarovski crystal so it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a bullet-skin wheel or a portrait of his wife from a circle shark doesn't have to ride on those wheels yet," said Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage in 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" at the moment does not mean much more exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of the properties here.
"If you bought yourself three or four years ago in Moscow's apartment, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least imagine wealth at the stand of the Russian-run Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has raised four red British-style telephone booths that have been carved out of counterfeit banknotes worth millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, stated that his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the Millionaire Fair.
The Collegiants stopped to scatter around a bunch of money, or to let their friends take pictures of their mobile phone, as they rest in the midst of their surrogate wealth, or simply cut out a pocket of a few million.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by an operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows at the restaurant about something healthier and followed the healing that came to a white New England house with two houses down the West Scott Avenue.
The car was soon connected to the police station.
And then another one.
"But I saw the delivery of a doctor," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant controller.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
The authorities found out that a dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, the executive assistant director of the Norwegian Police Department.
The investigators are now trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity was refused by the police to provide the woman who worked at the house number 212 at the West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that the toxicological tests, whose results do not have to be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that was sent to the wave of grief by the authorities of the Newar police.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, polite and hard working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroy was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, an ex-Nevavian police officer who works for the Commission to control alcoholic beverages, and that she left two sons behind at the age of 14 and 11 and her own daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the Union, Theodore J. Romankova, said the detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroy died of the consequences of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"Research is still underway."
The authorities indicated that they arrived at the house about three o'clock in the afternoon.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities heard from Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday in Miss Castro's house, with a ruined pink kerosene in the front yard and a Dalmatian lying in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door leading to the shop, a blue bar with the title "Ethyl Vanillin" was found in the open garage, which is used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
On the sides of one side she hung two mountain wheels.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that after his first 25 years in the New York Police Department in Newark, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable assistance in the investigation of his new city's hateful and harsh political culture.
"She said, 'You should take care of this or this,' he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that Fed reduces interest rates, leads to the strengthening of world stock exchanges
The shares prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the hopes of the market that the Federal Bank would try to settle the loan conditions by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by the reassuring statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The exchangers jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line with Ben Bernanke, President of the Fed, said that in response to continuing pressure on the financial markets, there must be "flexible and pragmatic" drivers.
As part of a clear effort to calm down the distorted markets in the midst of the signs of revitalization, Mr. Kohn said that recent riots "has partially reduced some improvements in the functioning of markets by the end of September and October".
He further stated that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of financial conditions for households and companies further deteriorates.
Investors consider these findings to be a sign that the Fed is ready to add additional fresh capital doses to the US market, and perhaps further lower interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These notes also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of other bad news about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The results of the financial belief were supported by the announcement by the investment bank of Bear Stearns that it will abolish 650 jobs, which are 4% of its global workforce, in the context of a reduction in the cost of compensating heavy losses caused by the unannounced commitment to the provision of subordinated housing loans in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be abolished in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 percent, or 2.7 percent, and ended at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, market credit tensions were shown to be in full force after the European Central Bank's three-month cash package auctions were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, which is the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release excess money on the London money markets increased by the rate of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" after an uninterrupted growth from 12 November to its maximum since the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's gonna be the number six on the thumb for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context of nothing less relevant than the first Sri Lankan Test, who is going to make this decision?
The second question is that David Graveney, the chairman of the electoral commission, which is held at the best in this position at the time, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the aid decision, and because the Hugh Morris table, the main manager of the English team, is starting to apply to the national electoral post, whether it is necessary for a full commitment.
Whoever is not built on the sixth place on the stake will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport no longer.
It's not easy to find what one gets at the top of his profession, while another never gets over the lower level, sometimes because of lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in the cricket is the choice demanding and requires a judgment that must at last always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shaho, if you will?
In the same way we could ask ourselves in other areas, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leading workers with good education and a review in the field, should be raised to the Commission - instead of just one.
Who's supposed to say what level is right for the cricketer if he doesn't get a chance to drop or swim on the next one?
Of course, they have numbers for decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, a cricketer must catch the captain's view at the right time, if he is to take a wicket, and a thumb needs a regular chance at starting positions, if he is to ever make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the sampler's view is more complicated.
For example, in the last season, James Anderson, whose place in the first test, seemed to be much better, even if Stephen Harmison had been declared healthy and found to be a carpenter.
Anderson took 32 tickets in the first class at 33 crossings on each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same mean, but they both had their time at the highest level and hoped in the next.
If he's going to play at the Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can make a difference or a career, or it does not have to be a big influence either.
Four years ago at Sri Lance Gareth Batty played in each test and in the first class gave good performances, five tickets and 40 permitted trips, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, who was also, although in Australia against Australia, recorded twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion on today's training purely at the Asirgy Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and give Shah's greater experience in front of Bopar's youth density.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, he speaks of his curved and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundreds in the first class opposite six Boparov, which is seven years younger in the twenty-seven years and has excellent statistics against spin excess.
However, Shah made in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in Testu na Lord's, his domestic playground in Middlesex, only ten passes, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to reassess him on another match, his fire seemed to wear something out of the ellain that was so evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the Essex University has a joie de vibrare in its bones.
At the cricket field, he has nothing to do with him and his behavior outside the playground symbolizes a recently turned car with a four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the English car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He took off with minor injuries and was shocked, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his partner, who was watching it from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is certainly better in the field, its medium-speed smile uppers in the present-day games that seem to fit, give away effectively and fire with self-consciousness and skill.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
Personally, I agree that Bopara will have his chance now, and I do not want to say that Shah will not excel if, as the Cylon tea leaves indicate, he will be the one to play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses of full Iraqi refugees from Syria began to come to Baghdad yesterday and to blow up the fugitives who came in money or ran the visa period, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the armed men who had expelled them from their homes.
The Mansur bus station was before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubajsi, Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, for what was done in Baghdad and how it's safe now.
"They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shishak militia militia of Muktady al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Athwani, an 80-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the longer regime did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shit neighbors in Amarija called him by calling the local militia with the support of the American army to help push Al-Qaeda out of her position on the west of the capital, and they insisted that he return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, whose home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad has avoided a grenade attack after he forced his fellow citizens to stand up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"The president called me a few friends and told me that he's going to Sleikh's militia against al-Qaeda and that he needs me and my boys' support.
That's why I came back today," said twenty-one-year-old Sabaah Alu Obedi.
Many spoke of the attractiveness of calming in the main city after the strengthening of the American military presence and the growth of the local "community of busy citizens", which is armed by the American army to defend its quarter.
But it was more about the fact that they were forced to return to the obstacles around the visas and the money loss in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a father of three children, voiced his suspicions shared among refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to restrict the visa of refugees and had them return.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving Iraqis a visa to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni MP said.
"I can't believe the government that supports the criminals who burned me after I left home."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the suns were pushed out of the Shiite regions and on the contrary, which in many places reduces tension.
There are concerns that the sudden influx of refugees again exhales sectarian tension and leads to another battle.
Small Sarsko, good education
Germany's smallest collapsing country plays a leading role in vocational education, even excels the international focus of its high schools.
In only one educational area, Sarko is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Sarska, I explained yesterday at the age of fifty that we are not French" - this self-iron password appears in Sarska on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest sex country.
France and Luxembourg, however, play a key role in the Sarah education system, which is in monitoring the education of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by France.
To this day, students can finish the study with a double or even three-thirds degree.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of foreign students, accounting for 15,6 %.
However, the average number of Sarah’s children is to be admitted to high school - many of them without high school.
"In Sarsk, a professional education system is being used," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW educational expert.
The fact that more than every fifth youth is entitled to study at the university is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarska to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two sectors are the second best in Germany, considering the number of inhabitants.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates fell by one third in recent years.
That is why the Serbian Ministry of Education has now ordered high schools to set up a promotion campaign in the engineering fields.
"After the first study of the Scriptures, we conducted several reforms in general education schools," says the Ministry of Education spokesperson.
That's why the government has conducted comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to begin to learn as soon as possible, the last year of the mother’s school is free - a model that takes over other school countries as well.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will show up to the next comparative study.
In 2003 the proportion of pupils at risk decreased from 29 % to 20 %.
In general, however, Sarsko has not improved as much as other countries.
The barbers can count better.
And to the disappointment of the Sarska study Pisa does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarsko could point in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in the universities - even though the inhabitants of Sarska are not French.
Chavez moves hours
What they won't see will be hours in Venezuela other than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will move hours in this South American country half an hour back.
In Spain, between Chávez and Chávez, there is a funny figure.
Venezuela's official newspaper reported that the hours under the new law against world time would be reduced to less than four and a half hours.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chavez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by making the United States divide the time bands throughout the hours.
In the middle of the local time, Chávez also announced that due to the case with the hostages, relations with neighboring Colombia would be interrupted.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that while conservative Alvaro Uribe is President of Colombia, he will not have relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't vote for my self-interest anymore," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the constitution, which citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
By this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The fight led Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels about the release of hostages.
Uribe, by his decision Venezuela, "swift in the face", criticised Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
And everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
The new mobile call here caused an explosion: "Why no te callas" (Why don't you shut up?) - so sounds like a phrase that has already gotten more than half a million people out of the Internet.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos spoke to her, who was so disillusioned at the recent Ibero-American summit that this left-wing populist was silenced in this way.
Germans are at risk of lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages even in the face of a strong economic downturn.
Experts have reasoned on their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to estimates of Hans Böckler's Office, in 2007 employees can actually count by getting lower wages than in last year.
"Wine is charged with a small increase in salaries, an increase in value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices," said Bild Gustav Horn of the Institute of Research IMB (Institut für Macroonomy und Konjunkturforschung).
New pressures on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the new year's planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the labour force should not again fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from young people, quoted the newspaper of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and oil products has driven inflation into its highest state in the last thirteen years.
In the annual price comparison, the total price stood by three percent.
Venus is a hell of a double earth.
During his life, Venus Earth's enemy atmosphere is more similar to what was expected. The European Space Survey Venus Express on Venus recorded phenomena that occur in the winter as well as on Earth: lightning in the atmosphere and wind beliefs in the fields.
For almost three decades, scientists have known that Venus is glamorous.
Now the Venus Express European probe has brought evidence - captures electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. At Venus they fly lightnings from the darkness to the darkness at about 56 kilometers, written in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory, the original mass could have been created on Earth by lightnings. The bores reportedly originated in the oceans of reaction that led to the creation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
It wasn't like, "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about 100 times thicker than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"Venus may be the hell twins of the Earth, but it's the twin," said Russell.
Why did Venus, which is such a mass and size of Earth, begin to develop completely differently, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
Since the beginning of the 1990s no probe has been sent exclusively for the purpose of Venus study, the launch of Venus Express probe in November 2005 was in the research of this planet as a milestone.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which approached several articles in the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like the Earth than it was supposed to be," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind beliefs in the North Pole, scientists have found a dark belief in the South Pole, which is much faster.
This phenomenon recalls air flows to the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysica Spacial and Physics Cosmica.
The second inner planet of our solar system forms almost the same mass as Earth, and the average of 12 100 km is almost the same.
This planet, marked as the Winter Day or Dinner Day, will run the Sun in 225 days.
However, it turns around its own axis much slower. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not remember the surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars on Earth, scientists believe that both planets are created under very similar conditions.
But on the Earth, it remained in the oceans, while it spread from Venus into the universe.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound to carbonates on Earth, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalajlama
Spolko President Köhler calls for the end of the party's dispute over the adoption of the branch office.
He criticised the SPD for her attacks on the office after a meeting in September.
Spolko President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and calls for a large coalition to put an end to the wave around the adoption of the Dalailams.
"We should not also present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the commercial newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of the German office of Angely Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalailam in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
The Social President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but it did not prevent Merkel from stopping when it was calculated to create a new policy towards China.
"The collective office has not left China's traditional policy.
China also knows," Köhler said.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) made a direct statement of his disagreement with the adoption of the Dalailams, and was attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the "predictive" foreign policy of the coalition.
After our admission to the office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the call by German Finance Minister Peera Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the SPIEGEL magazine, the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries abroad also froze.
The Chinese President of the Wen Jiabao government called on Angel Merkel's office to admit that the delay was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
Words and deeds have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also located in the territory of China, tries to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar troubles that have erupted in France
Street fights with police, gunshots, fuelled cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar troubles that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social unhappiness in Germany does not increase in street violence, the social minister calls for it.
The barricades burned, the excavators shot at the police. After serious youth troubles in France, the social minister, Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is concerned about similar developments in Germany.
"We need to be careful that social tensions do not also arise in us, which will result in violence.
We have to take it seriously," Neue Presse said in the Harvard newspaper.
Not every young person is able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The local government, the country and the locals are already working hard to eliminate the problems, Schäuble said.
Which is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit after the conference on Islam, we record our first achievements."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of French.
In the last few nights, youth with police in the northern suburbs of Paris fought hard street fights.
Even in Toulouse, she burned cars and public buildings.
More integration efforts by the German government demanded the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the problems in France, Kolat warned against the "accumulation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among the 25-year-olds who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "averagely high".
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We have to give young people hope."
The President of the Turkish municipality, however, added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat called out, "But we have to be careful."
We've got to let young people work and learn quickly.
In the meantime, the night at the Paris suburb of Williers-le-Bel remained mostly quiet.
There were hundreds of policemen in the camp and over the area the helicopter flew over with a flashlight.
Authorised authorities have reported three arrests and several burned garbage and cars.
Since yesterday, the peace has been extended to about 1,000 armed forces.
The police will intervene as long as it is necessary, announced after a visit to the pre-city ministry inside Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In trouble at the Villiers-le-Bel suburb, about 80 policemen were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse's troubles took over.
An accident caused a Sunday traffic accident in which two young people died.
According to the initial finding of state representation, the police do not carry any guilt at the death of young people.
In the reign of Angela "Oblakové"
The office's really remote output shows that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can't expect anything more from it.
What country does this office actually live in?
After her discontent, depressing and indiscriminate speech on the general debate of the Spolko dream, we must note: not here - not in this country, which she should finally manage.
According to Angela Merkel’s argument that she is too focused on foreign policy, she once answered a very arrogant sentence.
It's provincial, she said, which shows she doesn't want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In Spolko's dream, she saw how much she deserved this lesson.
He was not interested in Merkel, nor was he interested in problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" was presented: a politician who excels over others who pushes into foreign policy and even speaks only in a loud voice.
For example, climate protection: it is always praised for its conclusions coming from the summit in Heiligendam, but it does not say how the climate objectives are to be achieved in Germany.
And anyway, such self-reproach - so much modesty would forgive the president of the CDU two years ago.
Now it's limited to the planned phrases that could increase its pattern among people.
This approach damages its image of pragmatics, which does not need to be ashamed of, because problems are solved.
But in the reign of Angela "Oblakove" there are internal political problems of the district.
Children's poverty and anxiety, people with low wages?
A few other points on these topics have been left to her.
It's worth noting how often Merkel's in the case of children's additions, she's saying.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning in order for her to be able to express at least part of the correct sentence.
As soon as things start to become very specific, it's like in a completely foreign field.
Department of Attacks
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube in the case of the favorites of Rudy Giulianicho and Mitt Romney has been debated in the course of the debate - and both now have to worry about the external candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already on the first theme.
Mitt Romney presupposes to his opponent Rudy Guilianim that he made New York a refuge for illegal immigrants.
Giuliani reacts quickly with sharp insults: "I think his own house was just one such shelter," he answers and predicts to former governor Massachusetts, that he has employed immigrants in private without evidence.
Since the Republican Foundation has no clear preference so far, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on the CNN mainly to discredit their competitors.
A half-minute, internet user-driven and via YouTube sent video serves only as a key theme tip.
"This is exactly the policy of isolationism that we have enabled Hitler to grasp power," John McCain foresaw his opponent Ron Paul, who as the only one promotes immediate deployment of armies from Iraq.
The Vietnamese vet McCain doesn't check with either Romney or Romney for refusing to condemn the torture method of questioning called Waterboarding, which simulates warming.
The response of the public in Florida, St. Petersburg, shows that there is no war in Iraq or torture.
The defendant shall submit to the Board of Appeal any time the conservative values are accepted and the future increase of the data shall be refused.
Then it shows where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, and asks for a website and a TV audience to forgive him for being still in 1994 for the execution of kidnappings.
Giuliani is in despair when she is to express herself to a literal Bible translation.
Men's First Government in Civil
On the day after his resignation from the position of chief commander of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf made a presidential oath.
This will end eight years of military government in Pakistan.
On Thursday, the President of Pakistan, Parvíz Musharaf, made a presidential oath, which will take place in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistan's television broadcasts a live ceremony that was held in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
The man swore he would respect the constitution and strive for a good nation.
On Wednesday, his office of chief commander of the army handed over to his officer Ashfang Kiyanim, who was subjected to international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after he gained power in the bloodless military coup, the government's former general was the first civilian head of state.
By his resignation from the position of chief commander of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main requirements of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional status declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to High State Representative Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will abolish the exceptional status soon after his oath, thus fulfilling the further requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, after declaring an exceptional status at the beginning of November, had held in favour of him, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the State on 6 October last week.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured during the attack on the military convoy in the Northern Vaziristan tribe.
The Voice Army said the bomb exploded on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
Father's Krautrok is coming back.
The famous German group of seventy years is playing again. The three members of the Harmonia group re-enacted their electronic synthesizers at the Berlin concert.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a sister of the most successful band.
They've been much better known abroad for a while.
The announced sensation then consists in the performance of three seated gentlemen who at first look like they're just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and especially buttons.
Thirty-eight-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
After his left, he's seven-year-old Michael Rother, who's got a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven years old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who concentrates on the synthesizers, is from the right perspective of the spectators.
Everyone sings sounds, sometimes even beats.
Some of them, of course, will create a traditional composition.
It doesn't seem to be too much for the musicians.
Among the pets of the Krautrock, the revital of the chapels of Harmonia was a great pleasure.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of the pope, but it is certainly not so much a waste of this band for some twenty-three years.
But why could not even Germany celebrate its still living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when you're music-style, a well-known karutrock, in England and in America, you value more than in your own country.
When in 2003 the music business gave the remaining members of the Can Colin Group the Echo price for the work of life, the hall was full of asking views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu for their talk, the audience’s surprise no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts with them sat on the stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
Remembering the chapel of Harmonia, we overloaded memory, this trio only existed two years, and even at that time it did not have the influence that others later added.
Moebius and Roedelius used to play with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster.
At first, they were playing in the shop of the Berlin Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at the grammar company led by the church.
Rother briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but the reputation gained as a guitarist at the Neu band!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster band to exile in Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the 16th century ruins of Old Weserhof, they lived as members of the municipalities that fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius could still gloat like a sheep.
It was more of a life in such a spitzweg art apartment.
The name of the artist concerned shall be reportedly removed from the name of the singer Harmonia Ottenstein, whose mark was allegedly found in the ashes.
Many of this harmony has been preserved.
The first album was called "Hudba of Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
The collection of herbs did not serve only self-recognition.
Now released "Live 1974" CD was cut off at a concert in Griss in front of a record-breaking little, barely 50-year-old ball.
Rothera once expressed her desire to be a member of the harmony and to practice on occasion.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a completely wrong requirement.
In 1975 the band announced its departure.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and assured himself of his future with the album "Burning Heart".
The Cluster chapel has lived again in the 1980s, and since then it has been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for his live album.
His recording company Grönland took the goal of watching the Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The Neu chapel was then considered Rodeli's solo work.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Culture.
The show at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
He'll be present at Brit, Julian Cope, the old pancake and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
Even the founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
That's what we've been planning for the overall impact of the Krautrock on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will just fill in Harmonia.
Brian Ena, accompanied by the most beautiful sounds, is said in the hall: "Only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are images on which the producer with Harmony is at the farm.
The creation of a legend also contributes to the creation of other black-and-white photographs on which are now equipped with wild cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
It's not like I'm filling the microphones on the wires and drums to get those unheard of self-made tones out of the tools.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the puncture technique.
There's nothing to change about it, not even the House of World Culture.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under sound clouds and in one beautiful place she emphatically sings "Aaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always very English.
It's never been rock.
We would find roots more than in the blues at high school (Can), in the Kraftwerk technology or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever yells at this place "'68!" is not so far from the truth, but harmony won't even be allowed out of peace now.
And the most obvious thing on the stage is to think carefully.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This question is either preparing for the nerves or making it easier for him to experience the mixed moments of happiness.
Richard Gere's just not cynic enough.
With the film The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, there were two films about the war in the Balkans.
But not one of them is convinced.
The film presentation either puts too much emphasis on precision and shooting, or they're too emotional.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere will stop at The Hunting Party.
Good news as a first: War criminals Karadz and Mladić are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but right there, in the dark background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere October.
In recent years, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played many favorite, minor roles in adventure women's films, but in connection with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, man will enjoy another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - where the hunter becomes useful (Why must the names of the films be so long and confused today?).
Gere is performing a magic performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could have happened if fate and film industries were not so merciful: a man who has had his best years behind him, but as a sad memory-like one still retains a certain remarkable saying.
But even through this drum, The Hunting Party is together with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinema this week, just by continuing an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save the Serbian girl from the Kosovo shooter, one of whom is in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all the evil, this television film is changing too soon in the shooting and action.
There's going to be something much like the Kobru 11 series, without the street, but for that with the war.
In the film The Hunting Party, the exhibition will examine why the Balkan War has not yet managed to make a really good film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters, who are released as a "person", the Serbian top war criminal, could become a new "Apocalypse" at a different time and under the direction of another director and scriptwriter (here is both Richard Shepard).
Both stories look like a surprise: small groups go to the woods to do something that the army is not able to do, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the film The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not that brilliant and sentimental cynic represented at the beginning.
On the contrary, the presentation also presupposes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party's film can be recorded with final validity after the reporters in the last five minutes of the fast-track film have carried out what NATO, CIA and all the world's criminals have failed in the last five years: catching criminals and leaving him righteous revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of filmmaking that it's worth turning to the International Court of the Hague.
Then this film has a deep human message.
It considers that Karadz and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and France (here they are exceptionally united) that under secret political agreements they are not worthy of being pursued quite intensively.
But the good and the evil are sometimes so similar, the woman will attack us with Brecht's famous poem.
It is about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's work desk: "I feel like I'm looking at runaway veins on my forehead, notice: how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, they come up with exactly the kind of fancy heads that indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
Recently it was reported in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were very unsuccessful.
One can add: No good film about South Africa has ever been filmed.
It's almost always true: If the star lands after the crisis area or passes through the mine fields, a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Archette, Angelin Jolie's breaking edge or a Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapire will be produced.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close to time.
Finally, they had to spend decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
A lot of films must come - films that are considered to be classic Vietnamese works - "Shore of deer", "Apocalyps" or "Shoaled Vest" - were then not celebrated as masterpieces in any case.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers then do not have the ability needed to make the most of good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "Great dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how the Nazi regime really ruled in a terrible way.
Maybe a man shouldn't want to be good when he wants to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcasticly balanced artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked at the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said, "The only thing that does not change is that some things never change.
Cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and war in Yugoslavia will always be."
Von Beust blames for rejecting the Olympics
The departure of the mayor from the summer Olympics in Hamburg has been a direct criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the water game.
Von Beust, however, urges realism in the estimation of chance.
The Chief Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, marked this decision on Wednesday as "in terms of business as unfortunate".
No other project in recent years has awakened as much motivation as an Olympic thought in the city.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sporty political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but created a new long-term concept for it, "which comes from a changed time plan."
The mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic by 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports League will decide on the application of Munich to the Winter Games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with a time plan dating back to 2028."
Still, this dream hasn't ended, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) named von Beust's years as politative.
It's a feeling that Hamburg doesn't want to be held for the next twenty-five years.
"It's too soon to destroy your chances by marking plans at this early stage as funerals," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
It would be contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate, which he referred to at the Vale Assembly of the German High School Sports Association.
Von Beust here did not declare Hamburg's candidate at the University in 2015 as a replacement for the Olympics.
The Hamburg High School Sports Association only nominated the candidate city last week.
The SPD Group in the Hamburg Parliament of the Senate found that it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build flats in Hamburg.
"The development of Klein Grassbrook's area was interrupted by the Senate for years, because he had set up the organization of the Olympics and excluded the building of apartments," said SPD members Carol Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Klein Grassbrook region was still planning the Olympics by later using the entire area for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously set itself as an "olimpic factor".
The opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked a great excitement in Hamburg.
But Hamburk has wasted his time in Lipsk.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
The person who combines Swedish and wooden terms doesn't mean Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden beads produced at the present time in Sweden throw a dark shadow on the Warhol's list.
Most of it on the list of the ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" of Stockholm are falsifications.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" several months ago expressed doubts about the integrity of the Warhols "Brillo Boxes" in 1968, the internal research of the Modern Museum in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; the six "Brillo Boxes" which the Modern Museum devoted in 1995 to the gift of its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of the type Stockholm, which are on the international art market in the course of the year.
The previous events are a wrapped, maturing string of artistic and curatorial actions.
Warhol produced his first Brill box in New York in 1964, painted wooden beads that were based on the red-modal design of the paper box of Brillo powder.
The exhibition of his work at the Modern Museum in 1968 produced - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo bets from the cardboard. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
It wasn't about art, but about their suggestions, just the exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo bedens in Sweden, but you are not exposed in Moderna Museum.
The witness now speaks of fifteen children who have been admitted to art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem is now that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made and exposed to about a hundred woes that Warhol left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén’s beads were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrohrad only in 1990.
Warhol was three years after he died at the time.
Lars Byström, the top preserver of Moderna Muséet, researched in addition to six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their crossboards were painted in the basic color and rounded, were made of oil white.
On the other hand, the structure of a 1990 copy showed that the color was made of a painting roll directly on the cross-section board, not on acrylic and not on oil.
"These pains were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the Warhol's official Brill boxes," said director Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusion, Moderna Museet will have to classify six of his exhibit collections as "exhibiting material - copy."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that these "accused charges", which were brought in the case of a powder case, would be handled.
The organization, however, is still in constant silence.
Rebellious Soldiers in Manila Give Up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had settled in a hotel in Manila demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The rebel leader Antonio Trillanes, who ran the president of manipulation and corruption during the election, told the hotel reporters that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers of government surrender have previously attacked the hotel with a tear gas.
A few hours ago, about two dozen soldiers were locked up in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court because of a tired attempt to reverse in 2003, including Trillanes.
The action was used to escape with about 30 of his sympathians.
The military policemen who were supposed to watch him obviously walked over to his side and joined in the rebellion.
They entered the hotel in Pennsylvania and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government of the loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The President permitted an emergency meeting of the Security Office.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, the commander of the former elite squad Scout Rangers, said that other military units would join in the march in a short time.
The government's critics called for a large demonstration against the President on Friday.
For months, her government has been counting corruption.
The Manila financial area has already become the main cause of the rebellion against Arroya by about 200 soldiers in 2003.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion broke out in just 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made to overthrow the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel

The United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies in Freenet for the time being are satisfied with a share of more than 10 % and do not exercise their right to take over another 18,49 % of this company.
It is considered that companies have so far left open all options, especially the possibility to further increase their share in Freenet AG.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
This long-lasting and hard-to- transparent Freenet game has been part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracting customers on a mobile network and 1.27 million customers with a complete or DSL connection.
