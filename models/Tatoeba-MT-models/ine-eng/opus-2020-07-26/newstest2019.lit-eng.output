At that time, Lawyer Linas Belevičius, MG Baltic, stated that in order to ensure a complete personal defence, a panel of judges had to allow the new lawyer to get to know the material of the case and asked to withdraw the hearing.
"In order to ensure the defence of a person, he must be aware of the subject matter of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal sitting," said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroschev, pointed out that he could not get acquainted with either the indictment or all the material in the case.
Prior to that, the suspect, Mr Gustanis, informed his lawyer of his refusal because he could no longer pay him.
There were also audio recordings being heard at the meeting.

Ethics Officers: The Board of the Liberal Consensus on the Rights of the Vilnius Section
"The decisions taken by the government are in accordance with the statutes," the BNS reported after the Commission's meeting by its head, Vytautas Tamosiūn.
"Our decision was not something new.
As a commission, we had already made an explanation in July, when the issue of Fame and Uten was raised.
Then we said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter of the competence of the board.
And if the Board decides that any section may act as it wishes - to go with the committee and the Board supports it, then the section may go, but if the Board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which the Board has adopted, then it is a decision that all sections will form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and to go with the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamosiūn, the Party's board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Board of the Liberal Alliance of the Party annulled the decision of the city section of Vilnius to participate in the municipal elections, not with the party, but with a new electoral committee.
In the opinion of the Board of the Party, the decision of the capital liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, the Board's decisions.
By 31 October, Vilnius had to withdraw its intention to participate in the municipal elections with the Committee list.
But the department didn't do it.
The former head of the section, MP Aušrišnė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal community.
Vilnius Mayor, former president of the Liberal Alliance Remigius Shimasius, who promised to pursue another post of capital leader, has already presented the team and ideas of the Social Elections Committee for Vilnius, which will be proud.
He also left the party.
The elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place next year.
On Monday, officials reported on a tiger that had previously found one man in northern India.
The forest supervisor Mahavira Kaujlagi (Mahavira Kaujlagis) said that a man who worked in the fields had been arrested by the villagers and, while trying to break up, she was taken by a tractor.
People say that about 10 days ago, this tiger was also attacked and assaulted by a young man.
The village is located in the district of Lakhympur in the district of Kherio, about 250 km south of the city of Laknau, Utar Pradesh.
The possession of a tiger in protected areas shall be prohibited.
The Director-in-Chief Ramesh Pandey (Rames Pandăjus) said that the case would be notified to the police under the Rural Nature Protection Act.
In April, in the Nighasan region of the state of Utar Pradesh, the villagers killed another tiger, which suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Law on the Protection of Wild Nature, tigers are considered to be a destructive species.
Last year’s government data show that in the previous three years, at least one person was killed every day during the encounter with wild tigers or frogs.
People’s conflicts with tigers have gradually increased since the 8th decade, when India launched a tiger protection programme, under which the national parks have established bans and the death of large cats has begun to be seen as a crime.
Although the methods of counting of tigers have changed, the census shows that the population of approximately 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Recommended cats and dogs must be labelled with microschemes
The Chairman of the Committee on the Environment of the Seimas Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other Seimas members, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Law proposing cats and dogs to be labelled with subcutaneous micro-schemes.
"We suggest that cats and dogs should be labelled with sub-species and that they should be registered and labelled by the local authorities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, public funds will be marked free of charge by all dogs, and in 2020, cats will also be involved, so there will be no public funding and costs for the population," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Committee on Environmental Protection of the Seimas.
The amendments to the Law aim to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, according to the expected average price of the micro-scheme and service delivery of around 5 euros, all owners of animals will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total price for the labelling of all animals may be up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach EUR 2 million each year.
It is expected that the labelling programmes will be allocated through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, which will significantly increase revenue this year due to the increased redistribution of natural resources taxes and funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castrations and other programmes.
According to Mr Mažeika, the mandatory labelling practice has spread in almost all countries of the European Union, it also allows for the protection of the animals themselves (when they are easily returned to their owners) and saves the time of the farmers themselves when the fugitive and the subsisting of the plant’s search has to spend a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides for travel to be possible only with marked farmers.
At the same time, labelling requires responsible care for the animal’s entire life.
The previous proposals were necessarily marked by opposition, as the relevant programmes were proposed to finance the population's funds.
"The current model of this criticism should be avoided, as animal protection is proposed to finance the increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to label not only veterinary doctors but also the public, i.e. those who have heard special courses at the Veterinary Academy," said the authors of the project.
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing the Seimas groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmunds Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Winkus and others.

"Women lie better" star actor B. Arsobait is persecuted falsely
This is probably only a coincidence, but the brilliant red actor Brigita Arsobaitė has once again been given the role of lying.
At first the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Melagės" and finally the comedy "Melagais".
In this film, Brigita plays a prominent wife of the Song of Kazlauska hero.
"I really liked filming in Melagai, because I'm more of a theater actor and I'm very rare in movies.
A great team of colleagues has been gathered from the beginning to play a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the square was Sunny's dog!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I've never seen these little, decorative fifus foursomes.
But during the filming Sunny so joined me, that the sympathy became mutual and finally I even energized her to buy from the owner, but failed," said the actor smiles.
In the comical and intriguing peripecies of family members, for the first few minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagais", produced by Lithuanian hits "Untested" and "Besides our boys..." producer Paul Virbick and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Racionovas.
Your lover just reported - she's waiting.
It would be a great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you can't tell everyone 'good news', their parents will make an unexpected statement - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening even before the most beautiful of the year's festivals - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, for such atomisms were beyond belief.
All the heroes are not as they seemed from the first look...

Before the cancellation of EUR 100 million of unpaid taxes on migrants
On Tuesday, Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of the Place of Residence prepared by leader Ramūnos Karbauski.
56 members of the Seimas voted against - 9, and 25 abstentions.
Then Seimas will consider the amendments on or after 6 December, after the conclusion of the Government.
According to Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years, one person does not pay about EUR 1 000, and now there are about 100 thousand of such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys regretted that in this way Seimas would "invite people not to comply with the obligations" - to declare departure and then no fees would be charged.
Conservator Antanas Matulas, a member of the Health Committee, observed that Lithuanians living abroad are using a small health insurance fee to come to Lithuania to treat - they are provided with the same services as those who are paying this fee to the residents.
The amendments provide that those who have left Lithuania are considered to have paid social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and Sodra will be released from payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The head of the "Sodros" Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will facilitate the lives of people who have emigrated, and the activities of "Sodros".
A video clip on the Internet reveals a serious problem about a hearing forest
Swallowed as a mother's lock glued with a snowy latte, and the baby is still glued, lying down, and a copy of it again.
The video received a lot of reviews and comments.
People were dreaming of the backdrop of a little bow - not once on the ground, he was climbing back to his mother.
It does not happen for the first time, but the child does not have to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The image is really a matter of attention, but it also reveals the threat to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know the wild can sometimes be harmful.
"I'm clear that the bow drone was very agitated.
From their movements, they can see that they're freaking out.
If the environment did not damage the drone, they would probably have chosen a safer path or had it hit slower or more cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," said Ecologist Mark Ditmer to the publication The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues examined how the drones functioned.
The heart rate was adjusted for animals.
As the drone approached, some of them let go, others did not escape, but all their hearts began to cry more often.
Scientists advise drones to film animals in a responsible manner, not passing through, not raising noise and not crashing where it is prohibited.
You asked the fledgling president for a newspaper.
On Tuesday, the Kiev court invited the retired President Viktor Janukovykis to come to the trial for his alleged state extradition meeting - the invitation was announced in the State's official publication.
In the court's appeal, published in the Government's Knowledge newspaper Uridadov Kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend a criminal trial meeting on 19 November, which would allow his final arguments to be heard.
The document states that Mr Janukovyčius has the right to attend the meeting with a video link.
On 30 October, the Kiev Court issued a final debate in the Janukovyči case.
The Russian lawyer Aleksandru Goroshinski was given the opportunity to register foreign lawyers in the register by 19 November in order to be able to attend a meeting where V. Janukovyčius is expected to have a video link like his last word.
Kremliaus supported Mr Janukovyčius was transferred and fled to Russia during the Maydan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that a former Ukrainian leader had been transferred to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
That year, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine, and as soon as the country's war broke out between the separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, the battle has taken down some 10,000 lives, despite the efforts of many international communities to ensure long-term benefits.

The former Minister of Agriculture, Mr Dainius Kreivys, has already been approved as a Conservative candidate for the year.
In the weekend, during the first election of conservators, the party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipal Council.
As the party reports, the chairman of the list of preservatives became the chairman of the meeting of the TS-LKD Vilnius Section, V. Benkunskas.

Restrictions on cogeneration forces to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) to the authorities' decision to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Fatherland-Lithuania Christian Democrats (TS-LCD) reported that the group of members of the Seimas asked the KT to examine the conformity of the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by the managers to the Constitution.
"Parliaments stress that the provisions of the law aim to question the projects already in place of waste incineration plants, calling on the Government to set new restrictions (20 km from the territory of residence) until the entry into force of the law in Vilnius and Kaunas to build waste incineration plants", says the report.
"Parliaments note that, in view of the way in which the prohibition on the construction of objects of State importance (i.e. the distance and definition of the concept of "resident territory") is formulated in the law, it is concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denied the right to carry out economic activities relating to the production of waste fuel, because the established criteria are to be formulated in such a way that, in assessing the density and distribution of the population of Lithuania in the country, building such objects would be practically impossible in the territory of the country," added it.
We would argue that the legislation adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The KT has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and effects that have occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted act.
In this case, the Government shall be empowered to apply the law back in accordance with an unspecified criterion.
After establishing such a legal regulation to breach the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, the protection of legitimate expectations, therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law" - we shall refer to it.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration forces.
In the absence of projects currently underway, the state would not only experience hundreds of million financial losses, large losses and Lithuanians - increased heating prices as a result of increasing environmental pollution in waste disposal plants.
Members of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Alliance, the Socialist Group and the Senior Labour Party of the ruling Social Democrats, Algirdas Butkevičius, signed the address to the KT.
A few weeks ago, Seimas managed to gather 71 votes to reject amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted by President Dalios Grybauskaitė veto, which provided for the government's right to suspend the construction of cogenerational power plants already started, and also set 20 km from the area of residential quarantine to build such power plants.
The amendments to the law adopted by Seimas will enter into force as from 1 January 2019.
This proposal is planned to be discussed at the autumn session of Seimas.
However, the government's right to suspend projects already started is not planned.
The KT will record the order of the case - not earlier than a year later.
He published LeBron's statistics at the Lakers Club
The beginning of LeBron James' career at Los Angeles Lakers Club is not what he expected, the organization and the basketball fans.
The Lakers season began with four victories and six losses, and such a weak start helped to create a good start due to the possible release of coach Luke Walton.
However, only such languages calmed down President Magic Johnson, who stated that the coach would not resign, but it was necessary to play better.
The biggest team star, L. James, should turn to himself.
Although the brake statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 points of the receding ball and 7.7 results of the transmission.
But she wasn't telling the truth.
During the first ten season matches, other numbers also revealed that Lakers is playing better when there is no L. James on the site.
A +/- statistics show how much more points are inserted or missed by a team when there are certain players on the site.
Here, when L. James is in the square, Lakers spend 30 points this season more than the competitors.
He got 19 points more than the competitors on the ground.
At the Western Conference, Lakers currently marks only 13th place, but a few victories can turn everything into high feet.

V. Ačienė on the detention of R. Ačo: I believe in man's integrity and legal protection
"I was the most incredible thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, it may be that the ministry performs the work that is to be done.
We're all doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair action should be taken by him," BNS said V. Ačienje.
R. Ača Special Investigation Service (STT) held Monday - the law enforcement suspect that he was still a director of the administration of the Rasei Municipality and that the exchange could create exceptional conditions for the private company, which signed a contract with the city-run Rasei Bus Park.
The representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribed by R. Ač or by a participant in the masking of surpluses in various financial operations.
The council of the Municipality of Rasei district, R. Ača, was dismissed on the third April of this year by a third test following the alleged mistrust.
The former "warning" this year became a newly established member of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party of Gedimin Kirkilo, which stopped its membership on Monday.
R. A few years ago, he failed in the mayor's election as a representative of the election committee "Your Raseiini".
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy in the election of the Raseni mayor next year, but has not yet been decided whether or not to participate in the elections of the municipal councils.
V. Ačienė is a member of the Committee on Anti-Corruption on the list of Lithuanian States and Greens.
Politicians say that further legislative action will depend on whether or not it will be removed from the work commission.
"I really don't make decisions today, this week, I think, I'll decide.
I can see that if there is a need to make accusations, I will make a decision either in my own right or in my own right.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - all the time you spend in your place," she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives in Seim Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėniė invited Seimas President Viktor Prinkėtė and Head of the "States" Ramūnas Karbauskas to withdraw from the statements of the Group of Vidas Ačienės and withdraw it from the Seimas Anticorruption Commission by transferring it to another Seimas committee or commission.
It states that the further work of Mr Ačienė in the Committee on Anti-Corruption of the Seimas "would lead to public-based mistrust and discredit the work of the important parliamentary supervisory commission".

Grybauskaitka calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for the investments of the European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate foreign imports.
At the opening of the trade and investment forum on Chinese imports in Shanghai, Mr Grybauskaitė stressed that, in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common objective of Europe and China should be "to unite efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world", in response to the underlying tensions caused by the trade wars, the causes of "production surplus and unfair competition".
"The European Union is very important to China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible by ensuring that foreign business is expected and secure here, as well as by strengthening intellectual property protection," said Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that transparency of investment must be "higher than any interest of any business group".
"Distribution, rule of law, strict observance of international treaties - this must be an essential part of the new investment relationship environment," stressed D. Grybauskaitė.
"The corrupt flows of capital should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to mitigate the criticism that avoids opening up its market and protects only its businesses.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China currently holds 25th place among export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, reaching EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China amounted to more than EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that China's investment in Lithuania can have an adverse political impact, while Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe undermines the EU's unity.

Discovered reason for the crash of the Lion Air aircraft: the nearby intruder
On Monday, researchers reported a lack of speed measurement during at least four of the last flights of the Indian airline Lion Air.
The president of the National Transport Safety Committee (NTSK) said that a similar approach occurred during the last four flights, including a decisive one, when on 29 October the ship landed in the Java Sea immediately after its departure from Jakarta.
During this disaster, all 189 people were killed on the plane.
A lot of media reports about the failure of the previous flight Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was actually the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," said S. Tjajon through the press conference.
"The Jewish box data showed that two flights before the journey of Denpasar-Jjakart were the same problem," he added.
"There's a lot of goose in social networks.
We now want to explain that in the black box (supply data) there were four flights through which there were problems with air speed measurement," the head of the NTSC said.
During the meeting with the family members of the deceased, Mr Tjajon said that the information of the aircraft recording the flight data was consistent with the reports that when the aircraft rose the speed of the last flight and the altitude had changed irregularly.
The search teams have not yet produced the second black box, recording conversations in the pilot cabin.
Lion Air indicated that it had been corrected in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations following a technical failure from Bali to Jakarta during the flight.
One of the company’s founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to the communication minister Budi Karyas Sumadi, a moderate meeting of family members with officials who oversee the search for aircraft and victims and a disaster investigation.
However, he stood up and raised his head, when angry and grieving family members demanded that R. Kirana, together with his brother Kushnan, be joined by Lion Air in 1999.
"Lion Air was acting improperly," said one man, who was reportedly a passenger of Shandy Johan Ramadan, a working prosecutor on the island where the plane is flying, father.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never met me since the crisis.
We lost our child, but "Lion Air" didn't show us any feelings."
After this meeting, R. Kirana quickly left, avoiding the issues of journalists.
Many families are waiting for the long-term results of the process of recognition of the dead.
Police medical experts have been transferred to nearly 140 lavos, loaded parts of human support.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The natives raised the question of why the blade was allowed to fly two months ago, although a failure occurred during the flight from Bali to Jakart on 28 October, among other things following the sudden crash of the passenger plane down immediately after the rise.
"Lion Air" said this mistake was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - He asked one of the sons of the dead.
- If not, the relevant techniques must be taken into account.
The law is very clear, they did not claim that the aircraft was allowed to be lifted again.
These bad techniques must be answered in accordance with the law in order to prevent the recurrence of aircraft disasters in Indonesia.
S. Tjajon said that a large amount of small droplets and the fact that the droplets spread in a relatively small area indicates that the shipyard was probably climbing into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was unique when it crashed into the sea.
It did not blow up in the air, and the aircraft engines, when it hit the water, acted in large rotations - it shows all the broken turbines," the official explained.
The Lion Air plane crash has been the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died in Medano after the plane crashed.
After the accident, the rescuers led the rescuers: they were injured and underage.
On Monday evening, the Vėžaiti - Plungė, the cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz met with Tilviki.
The cars were hit by a bomb, reported about three people who were injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, went on the opposite side of the road, and the father of the Mercedes-Benz car, born 1967, and the daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver saved the firemen from the wreckage - the rescuers.
You're a girl from Mercedes-Benz who's been missing the data during the crash.
All the patients were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: there is no need for artificial relief on the referendum
After the Seimas approval of the proposal by the leaders to reduce the referendum card to the first section of the Constitution which currently has greater protection, the President has amended the veto, says its advisor Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its exchange, in particular the articles in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority .
It's not hard to predict that the president is really vetoed," said Dalios Grybauskaitė's Advisor to Internal Policy on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defined the basic matters of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, so that, by reducing the number of votes required for these articles, Mr Lingues would create a "negative precedent" and a "reversible risk".
"In the opinion of the President, there is no need for artificial relief, there is a need to prepare for the referendum, there is a need for more dialogue with people," he believed.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the amendment to the Referendum Law.
It provides for the adoption of amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution on a higher level of protection provided that at least two fifths of the citizens with the right to vote are accepted during the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote may change the referendum of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution.
The right of elections in Lithuania has approximately 2.5 million citizens: half were 1.25 million voters, two fifths were million voters.
This proposal was born after Seimas approved the President's veto on September on the amendments previously adopted in Parliament, which mitigated the requirements for the number of votes in favour of the amendment of Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution.
The Charter for referendum is proposed to reduce the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May next year and on 26 May, when the first and second round of presidential elections are planned.
Emigrants cannot currently have dual citizenship on 11 March 1990, with the exception of some exceptions.
The dual-citizen community of the world's Lithuanians, however, is afraid that, under the present conditions, referendums will not take place - to vote against a sufficient number of people.
R. Masuulis: Lithuanian airports "barška", therefore they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure are starting to collapse, so it needs to be updated, says Minister of Communications Rokas Masuilis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius airport is the minimum task that the State must carry out.
"The air transport infrastructure is already failing because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - it does not even fit in with the remote planning - it is the minimum we need to do," said Mr Masuulis on Tuesday at the conference on communication between the Democratic Development Fund and the State magazine.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, as important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the external port of Klaipeda, the renewal of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and perhaps the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, construction of the external port of Klaipeda, airport management, perhaps decision on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, now start projects that will take advantage of our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Communications.
Mr Masuulis repeated that too little money has been allocated to car road surveillance in recent years.
"The condition of the roads is still not improving, because the funds are not provided enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even the most necessary supervision, for example on highways, lacks funds.
We must determine the amount to be spent on road surveillance if we want their situation to be improved," said Masuili.
He stressed that exports of Lithuanian transport services increased 18.6% this year and the largest export market became Germany, covering Russia.
Mr Masuulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers should return to the country of registration on a regular basis.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for the trailers to return to the house is absurd because in Europe, empty trucks, fuel, fuel, would increase emissions.
Most of this will result in railways because the costs will rise to the extent that some of the transport will be transferred to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," said Mr Masuilis.
According to the Ministry of Communications, 12.2% is created in the transport sector.
Lithuanian Common Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Conflict with heirs
Last week Mr Masuilis, in the Committee on Economic Affairs, announced the beginning of negotiations on the change in the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the old terminal to be demolished and a new one to be built.
However, the temporary head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis p. Masiulis called for discussions with political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the last decade is a value, registered in 1993 and not for politics, and specialists have to decide on its removal.
Mr Masuulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"From the legacy to extract that old terminal would be a politically important step in order to be able to tear it down and build a new modern terminal of arrival to feel in a modern country in Vilnius, rather than in such an interesting, non-representative country as innovative," said Mr Masuilis last week.
Mr Masuulis also said that Kaunas plans to build a completely new passenger terminal and to connect the airport to the Rail Baltica river, building a underground station.
This transport space should operate in 2026 after the end of the rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected that 4.8 million passengers and 5 million next year.
The airport of Kaunas served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

Next year from Vilnius will start direct flights to Madagascar
In the spring of the following year, the largest scheduled flight will be lost at Vilnius Airport, Boeing 767, which will fly directly from Lithuania to the Bee Island of Madagascar on the basis of information from the travel organizer Itaka Lietuva.lt, the portal will write "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that the airlines of Blue Panorama will be able to choose from 259 economic classes and 8 business places.
The new holiday destination will be reached directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, Director General of Itaka Lietuva, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new destinations.

For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about disease
"We always have to prepare for more difficult times.
As I want to be happy, for the first time in Lithuania's history, the third year will be the first time we have reserves.
But also a very important thing is not to talk about disease," Mr Shapoka said on Monday in Brussels.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Finance Minister and Deputy Minister Miguel Tuskienė are participating in meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting addresses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is aimed at avoiding fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how to tax revenue for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States until a global agreement is reached.
The euro group will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the EC makes use of this option.
For more information, please contact Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss strengthening the Economic and Monetary Union: the possibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that the ESM functions must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian Labour Traditions and Practices
Recently, 120 years have passed since the birth of a prominent Lithuanian photographer and cultural journalist, ethnographer and co-scientist Bali Burač (1897-1972) in Sidria, Šiaulėna vass, then in Šiauliai government.
Remembering the 100-year anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how life-enhancing national rebirth has called for many Lithuanian people, including Buracus - Bal, Jonah, Bronius - from the very depths of the village, to be able to engage in the cultivation, preservation and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balis Buraça, who traveled to the country of his birth with his camera in his hands for more than 50 years, presented a broad and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve fast-moving national culture and had a rare ability to perceive the lasting value of his work.
In the photos of Bali Burač, Lithuania's landscape, city halls, day-to-days and festivals have decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines in our people's national costumes.
This publication contains much of the legacy of Bali Burach for the description of national customs and related traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite the two world wars and heavy occupations.
The book contains a wide range of cross-sectional descriptions of the works, their festivals and other traditions and customs recorded by Bali Burač in the books of the Land, in particular the shops, the cemeteries, and the Telsche, as well as the works of the people of Upper Saxony.
About 10000 negatives from museums and archives have been selected for this publication in over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, which are characteristic of shopping, diving, other areas of the Highlands and the Earth.

Tragic married fate: He died just after a few hours of marriage
In the southwestern state of Texas, a couple of young people who had been married just a few hours earlier died during a helicopter disaster.
Twenty-four years old William Troy's Byler and his partner, Bailey Ray Ackerman Byler, died on a Sunday shortly after midnight in the middle of a firefight in the valley 16 km north west of Juvaldja and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is a strange fact that the accident occurred about 20 miles [24 km] away, just as many young people have been in the years.
A helicopter pilot of 76 years of age Gerald Douglas Lawrence also died.
Young people studied at Samo Houston State University, located in the city of Huntsville of Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening in the Byleri family's hand near Juvaldi and after the wedding party, a family-owned helicopter.
The accident occurred about 30 miles [24 km] away.
The young passengers flew to Sant Antonia’s international airport, where they were going to board the plane and fly the honeymoon, said S. Kennedy, without indicating the destination of the final couple’s journey.
"It is a very dear, uneven relief area, and the hill is about 120-150 meters high," said S. Kennedy.
Mr. D. Lawrence has been flying that family for many years.
According to S. Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should explain the physical condition of the pilot and whether it could not become the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after rising.
His discounts looked wide on the rocky slope of the hill, and the body remained "hazardously modified", said flight safety investigator Craigs Hatchas of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) on Monday during the press conference.
The researchers intend to remove the debris and then carefully examine it, but the truck and the truck will not be easy to reach, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been established and the preliminary report of the NTSB should be published two weeks later.
Israel's Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran "historic day"
"Today is an historic day," said B. Netanyahu to members of his party Likud Parliament, his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of the President (Donaldou) Trump (Donaldou Tramp), the United States introduces particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran all the time, when efforts to provoke his aggression began," said the head of the Israeli government.
Earlier Monday, Israel's defence minister Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lyberman) stated that the new sanctions would impose a "resolved" blow on Israeli actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls "the most severe sanctions of all time" began to apply after the decision taken by D. Shortpo in May to withdraw from the world power agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme, which is controversial.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which has already reached about a million barrels a day since May, and to eliminate Tehran from international funding.
Israel has long rejected that agreement with Iran and says that its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish State also states that the abolition of sanctions has made it possible for Iran to finance the fighting groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in the neighbouring Syria and has promised not to allow it to become military.
The other parties to the agreement with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not support the US decision and say that the agreement, as has been foreseen, has so far not allowed Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.
The Court reinvigorates the circumstances of the young motorcyclist's death
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, northern town, will be heard by the court in the event of an accident.
On Tuesday, the Vilnius District Court decided that, in order to ascertain all the relevant circumstances of the case, one witness would be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November.
The case has already been brought before a preliminary ruling, but it is not in agreement with the prosecutor's office.
On August 22nd, the Vilnius City District Court on the death of a motorcycline car driver, 79-year-old Eduard Osipov, announced that the motorcycline in the city was in high speed and had a serious breach.
The Vilnius District Court of the District Court asks that the judgment of the District Court be annulled and argues that E. Osipov is responsible for the greatest accident and that the conclusions of the District Court are not justified.
The lawyer of the family of a deceased motorcyclist also asks for a remedy to be abolished.
Avarija took place on 11 August 2015 about 15 hours when E. Osipovo's driving car Škoda Fabia from the Lakūna Street entered the Zirmūna Street and met the main road bike.
The prosecutor accused the man that the driver of the car violated the road traffic rules and caused a road accident - the man who was driving the main road to Piaggo.
The first police reports state that the driver of the engine died, but later after the investigation, it is established that the vehicle is capable of being compared to the motorcycle.
The judge of the Vilnius City District Court Roland Bužinskas BNS has said that the experts have found that the motorcycle driver was running at an hourly speed of 89.2 kilometers, although speed is allowed at a speed of 50 kilometres per hour.
"The car driver could not predict that the motorcycle would go at such a high speed," said the judge.
At the time, the driver of a proud old car claimed to be driving just 5-6 kilometers in an hour.
The driver trying to stop and drop off the vehicle before meeting Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor’s office believes that E. Osipov, on the other hand, had to give his way to a motorcycle driver.
"Novaja Gazeta": Six Vagner Serbs died in Syria
Among those killed are five Syrian military soldiers and six members of the Vagner military company.
The source "New Gazette" is published in Syria.
According to the source, one of the members of the 5th Syrian military corps was deployed in that territory, with many Syrian volunteers and military officers.
"Novaja Gazeta" sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request for information on the Russian fate.
The former king of Belgium will have to carry out a parental test
This decision is part of the victory of the artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, she has been seeking recognition of her former monarch child.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II, had a short love novel decades ago.
An 84-year-old king denies his father.
According to the station RTBF, he may refer to the Supreme Court in opposition to the DNA investigation.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boelis - the former husband of Delphine's mother - is neither biological nor legal in any way an artist's father.
For the relevant investigation, Delphine called for the recognition of Albert's "true" father's daughter.
Allotment of money to the parties of the PRC, but not to the social workers
This week, the High Electoral Commission (VEC) intends to allocate to the largest political parties a budget of nearly EUR 3 million.
This spring, the ruling party of the Socialist Party of Lithuania (LSDDP), led by Vice-President Gedimino Kirkilo of Parliament, has not been planned to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they may be granted by a separate decision of the PRC in the near future, if the legal environment is changed, governing the distribution of grants to the parties.
Laura Matjošaitete, president of the VRC, informed the U.K.U. that "a Commission meeting is scheduled this Thursday to take a decision on the half-year allocation of the budget to the parties".
In its view, the CoR has to take a decision on this matter by 15 November.
It is planned for seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, to distribute EUR 2,751 million.
The opposition of the Father-Lithuania-Lithuania Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million for the Heads of State and Green Union - around EUR 0.55 million for the opposition Social Democrats - about EUR 0.5 million for the opposition Liberals - almost EUR 0.4 million for the seven non-attached Labour Party - around EUR 0.23 million for the newly-attached People's and Justice Party - almost EUR 0.22 million for the Parliament, but neither the ruling nor the opposition-unpublished Polish election-Christians - around EUR 0.18 million for the union.
Under the law currently in force, which also distributes budget money to the rulings, grants shall be granted to parties who meet the requirements laid down by the law and have received at least 3% of the votes during the recent elections of the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow only the LSDDP established this spring to expect money from the budget.
However, this party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers will receive at least a few hundred thousand euros in the next three elections - the municipality, the president and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendment of the laws of the political parties and the budget of the Seimas was adopted this year by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but representatives of the rulings, Mr Kirkils and the Green Leader of the States, Ramūnas Karbauskis, believe that parliamentarians will try to reject the opposition of the President.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this Thursday's meeting in the UK, so, according to Mr Matjošatitė, "the grants will be allocated in accordance with the legal procedure which has been in place so far".
Indeed, the Head of the CRA did not reject that, if Seimas rejected the President's veto this week or the new amendment to the budget allocation of the parties, the Commission may consider the award of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"When we make a decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are the executive authority that has to implement the laws adopted," she said.
If Seimas were able to reject veto and new laws would enter into force, the Government would have granted additional funds to the parties, which would have resulted in additional loans.
Seven parties already allocated grants for such a decision would not be harmed.

Report: Activist Handziuk's murder orders must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and today more than 20 - will not be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and I do not have to receive information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency, and law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only that will be possible to learn the truth and punish the evil," said Mr Poroshenko at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he is most interested in the murder of Mr Handziuk, and that the murderers, the organizers of the crime and the conscriptors would "take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been re-qualified to murder, they are completely right and reasonably threatened by the death penalty to life," said the President of Ukraine.
He rightly called the requirement of the public to examine this case openly and impartially.
Mr Poroschenka stressed that the statements made by the representatives of law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that "the government has firmly decided to withdraw criminals and murderers, whatever they may be".
He also said that political speculation on this issue would not help to clarify the situation, but would get more and more confused.
"I call on all, both power and opposition-supporting forces, not to judge baseless arguments and, thank God, not to use this killing in public relations," said the President.
- On the contrary, we now have to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and clear, fast, so that the public can be trusted.
We just don't have another way."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation for destabilization in the country," he said.
In July, before the battle for corruption, Mr. Handziuk was swept away and burned with acid in Cherson City.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern city of Ukraine.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but on Sunday, she died in the hospital.
On Tuesday, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Jurijus Lucenka, gave a statement of resignation to the police and prosecutors without explaining the charges against the accused.
After her death, the public officials were accused of not being able to carry out a proper investigation.
Activists also called for the resignation of the Minister of Public Prosecutors and Internal Affairs.
"I present my resignation statement today," said Mr Lucenka to Members of Parliament, reading my investigation report.
Parliament has yet to accept the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka blamed the activists for pressuring the investigation and for providing important information, and therefore it is difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates delivered the toilet without water
When delivering a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates' transition from traditional such facilities to the waterless compared to the revolution of computers of the past eight decades.
The founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, presented a high-tech toilet in Beijing that does not need water pipes, reported Reuters.
The toilet works without water according to the principle of the separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the field of sanitation in the past 200 years," - Bill Gates quoted Bloomberg as saying.
A technological toilet was created with funds from a charitable fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda.
Over the seven years, the fund has spent $200 million on a facility that could convert human waste into waste or water.
In total, Bill Gates said about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced massively, the Gates Fund is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Street Fund, poor sanitation conditions cause 500 thousand children to die each year for up to five years.
Fighting poor sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, increases health-related funds, which already reach 233 billion.
In order to better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates presented a glass of faeces to the toilet.
According to him, it is a good reminder that in a small example "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand germ parasites."
S. Slyva, elected President of the Mass football Association
On 5 November in Kaunas, an extraordinary Lithuanian mass football association meeting was held, in which Sergey Slyva was elected president of the new organisation.
As a result of the request received to withdraw from the office of President of the Association, the non-exit universal meeting of the members of the Association was convened.
It was attended by 13 members of the 15th class.
The main issue of the agenda was the election of the new President.
Two candidates participated in the elections - Sergeis Slyva and Vaudotas Rastenis.

In these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not contact plants or farm workers.

In France it has been used every year for about 700 tonnes.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, have complained about breathing problems in the Anje region, where there is a lot of salad juices, eye and throat.
"These episodes confirm the justice of our decision, but do not try it," said Deputy Director Francoise Weber (Françaiza Weber) to the newspaper "Ouest France" on Monday.
Metamium - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - the US Environment Agency (US EPA) considers to be 'probably human carcinogenic'.
This pesticides, sold by names such as "Vapam" and "Sectagon", is authorised in Europe for up to 2022 when a new security check has to be carried out.
"There was no choice but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether it is alternative," said F. Weber to that paper.
"We understand the difficulties that will arise for the producers of salad juices, together with farmers, but the public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of metam in the region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region near Nanto, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salad juice consumed in Europe each year is produced.
The next season will be "a lot less salutary juices, cauliflowers and couples", last month, after the government has stopped using metamas, the news agency AFP told Nanto's Federation of Producers Philippe Retiere's (Filipas Retjeras).

President Paul Biya pledged to the seventh term of office in Cameroon after the controversial elections
During the ceremony held by Parliament's President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril 85 years ago, Mr Biya promised to preserve the "unity and unity" of the West African state.
The former African President, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was announced in the winning elections on 7 October, which I held 71% of the vote.
However, the elections were subject to low voter activity, violence and suspected fraud.
In the early days of the Biyo inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the Directors, were arrested in one Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English separatists carry out a armed campaign for independence.
Most of Cameroon's 22 million people are French-speaking, and the fifth is English-speaking.
In 2016, in the North West and the neighbouring South West province, there was a demand for autonomy in the areas of alleged discrimination in education, justice and economics.
In 2017, Mr. Biya refused to give up, the radicals announced an independent state, the "Republic of the Amazon", and raised arms.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces died during the separatist attacks and government responsible operations this year.
More than 300 thousand people have fled from violence: some - across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-arid forests.
The elections held in October in the North West region voted only 5% of the voters and 15% of the electorate in the South West Province.
In both parts of the country, two thirds of the votes were cast.
Primary choice of preservatives: error caused by non-exploration
"When there's something missing - you realize that the party has organized everything in its own resources.
Some municipalities have allowed access to their premises, but there were no voting booths everywhere, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank those who have fallen asleep," said the politicians.
According to him, complaints were brought, but their content does not change substantially, and the violations themselves are not malicious.
"There was a complaint.
Not all of the people who participated in the elections have experienced this, and they have also experienced it.
Thus, not all of our actions were consistent with our procedures.
Therefore, it was necessary to warn the CRK to comply with our principles described.
These complaints still do not justify doubting the results," said A. Anushauskas.
According to the president of the CRK, there have been cases where the ballots were not printed - after having learned about this, the ballots found in the ballots were cancelled without a stamp.
In some cities, however, complaints and violations are related to several ten ballots, according to A. Anushausko.
"Well, since the difference between several thousand, it is certainly not essential for the results of the elections," explains Anushauskas.
It is said that the party members' activity in the elections was 55%, while non-partisan voters' activity was 69%.
The two candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in the commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also do not change - for Ingrid Shimonyta the winner voted 79% of the voters (16418 votes), while for Vygauda Ushaka 21% (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LCD Council will officially support I. Šimonytė's candidacy in the election of the President of the country in May of the following year.
A short saying is probably not going to meet with Putin Paris
The White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said earlier that Mr. Shortas will meet with Mr. Putin in Paris, where this week will be the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
However, during the last sittings before the U.S. Central Congress elections, Mr. Shortas stated that it would be a good opportunity for journalists to meet with the Russian President.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," said the President of the United States.
However, the leader of the White House was added, and I will see them during the G-20 summit and "probably many times" thereafter.
D. Short continues to attempt to "overload" relations with Moscow, despite the suspicion that Russia is joining the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections.

Schools already want to learn differently: promise less tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday in Vilnius at the Forum "Education content change: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania".
Speaking in the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrausskienė said that over the past ten years, EUR 30 million has been invested in the updating of the content of education, but the results are not visible.

The report by the Ministry of Education and Science quoted EBPO expert Phil Lamberts (Fila Lamberts) as saying that Lithuania is too focused on the provision of knowledge rather than on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, Lithuania's general education programmes focus heavily on academic literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility for education, but also on children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy for education.
The Vice-Minister of Education and Science, Ms. Gražvydas Kazakevičius, presented changes in the general content of education, said that this year's start to update programmes will be smaller, more concrete, more closely linked disciplines.

Small standardised tests.
The general education programmes are promised to be digital, user-friendly, connected to the e-resources, the task bank.
The update of the educational content aims to improve student achievement in the international PISA study by at least 10%, and a third reduction in the gap between student achievement and the modern competences acquired in the school would be written in various areas.
Since May 2018, Lithuania has been planning to spend EUR 7.8 million on the European Union and the State budget in order to update its content.
It is expected that the project of general education programmes updated in the academic year 2019-2020 will be tested in part of schools and will start to be implemented in all schools from September 2021.

For four years, EUR 7.8 million was allocated, and the first purchase of EUR 1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October, which was sought by educators.
After criticizing this purchase, he was suspended, Minister of Education and Science J. Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrios Vadrės Vaddym’s director of the Centre for Development.
In Lithuania - Practices on how to react to the extreme flood
In Lithuania on Monday, ten-day practice begins to improve the institution's response to the extreme flood.
As informed by the Fire Protection and Rescue Department (PAGD), the exercise will examine how state institutions are prepared to work in the country after declaring the state-level emergency situation, such as flood: eliminating its effects, coordinating the search for people, rescue and rapid deployment from the occupied territories, organizing their supply of drinking water, food, ensuring the necessary supply of energy and providing other measures for the protection of the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of the centres of emergency operations in 12 municipalities will participate in the exercises.
In November 5-13, a preparatory exercise will take place, during which the municipalities, which have received information from the hydrometeorological service from the PAGD on non-satisfying precipitation and starting the flood, will take decisions on emergency management.
The active exercise phase is scheduled for November 14-15 days.
During this period, the Department will operate the State Emergency Operations Centre and the State and municipal institutions will be the emergency Operations Centres of the institutions.
Following the announcement to the Government of the state-level emergency on the effects of the floods, the Prime Minister appointed the Head of Operations to lead the resolution of the emergency, the elimination of its effects, the protection and rescue of the population and assets.
Deputy Director Mindaugas Kanapickas said that it was important in the exercise to verify the readiness of the institutions to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities of exchanging information, to verify how the crisis was prepared to warn and inform citizens, state and municipal authorities, institutions and businesses and to "improve the powers of the management of state institutions' emergency situations".
The practice will also demonstrate the overall capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to cross a large amount of water from occupied areas.

On 31 July at her house, an unknown attacker, K. Gandziuk, struck the face with an acid pump.
On 4 November, she died in the hospital for the injuries she suffered.
Protesters to the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine require a response that killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix from there.
According to Mr Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation shows that 12 people may be involved in the murder order of K. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was lost to the media, which poses a threat to the success of the study.
According to the Attorney-General, as a result of the information being leaked, the suspects were given essential knowledge.
Mr Lucenko was personally familiar with Mr Gandziuk and was disappointed that some politicians were using her blood in public relations.
"When no one has reason to say that someone is acting in accordance with the authorities, I want to say that I am making a statement to resign.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss this issue in Parliament," the statement by Mr Lucenko quoted in the Radio as saying, "Obozrevatel".

Mr Lucenko is considered a close associate of President Peter Poroshenko of the country.
On 12 May 2016, he was appointed by the Attorney-General to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokina, suspected of covert corruption by senior officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy J. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elta informed the Council of Energy Ministers Aurelia Vernickaitė, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC) data, transport is the only sector, without currently pursuing the tractors at EU level of the national renewable energy plans, the share of renewable energy in 2015 was 6%.
In the EC's assessment, progress towards a binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a variety of difficulties, including rather high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulation.
In this sector, renewable energy is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), and electricity has a lower role at this stage.
Seimas has taken the issue of the proposed corruption investigation to supplement the use of preservatives to KT
On Tuesday after the submission, the Seimas approved a proposal that was registered for the investigation of an illegal influence on political processes by "State" Agnie Shirinskienė.
There were 58 members of the Seimas, before - 27, who held nine parliamentarians.
The draft will be discussed by the Seimas Committees, which will be the main focus of the Committee on Law and Law, headed by A. Shirinskienė.
Following its conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of the resolution.
At present, the Seimas Interim Investigation Commission, which is conducting a new political corruption investigation, has been designated to explain the possible illegal impact in 2008-2016.
Mr Shirinskienė proposed that this deadline should be extended by stating that "there has been significant information on possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and public authorities in public space".
A. Širinskienė lists "the possibility of representing the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or calling upon the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the High Commission for the Ethics of Civil Service".
Addressing the Constitutional Court for pensions has been initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The leaders of the "states" found that the conservatives had largely supported the arguments of private pension fund advocates in their prayers.
With the impact of the "State Leaders" of the Supreme Service Ethics Commission (VTEK), Povil Urbša has been accused of having been involved.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Management Committee of the State of the Seimas and Municipalities could have instructed the members of the VTEK to discharge the former Head of the Commission's Prevention Division, Mindaugas Sieur.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to explain the possible illegal influence of interested persons or groups, the impact of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual policies, the operation and financing of parties and public movements, the legislative processes, the election of state-run enterprises, heads of public bodies, the management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to consider what information the law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities as they have responded to it.
The researchers should submit their conclusions by 1 May of the following year.
At that time, a campaign will be held by the President, the European Parliament.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are representatives of the "States".
Its members are also appointed two social workers, after one "order", a liberal representative of the Lithuanian-Christian Family Union elections.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
A new investigation was initiated by the President of the Lithuanian Heads of State and Green Union.
In his opinion, the previous session, a study by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSSC) basically showed that the same subjects had to be continued.
The German Internal Intelligence Director has lost his post
H.G. Maassen's 55th controversy was further fuelled by the statement that his troubles were caused by the "radical left forces" at the Merkel Coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised before, but was forced to leave the reserve.
In addition, last weekend, it became clear that a few weeks ago, at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw, H.G. Maassenas criticised the "innovation" policy of immigration.
For a long time, German Interior Minister Horstas Seehofer, defending the intelligence leader, said at the press conference on Monday that H.G. Maasseno's comments were not accepted and "insulted personally".
Mr Seehoferis, himself in the face of pressure from both this dispute and the lack of his party's presence in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release H. G. Maassessen into custody.

The girls in the crowd are tearing down stereotypes about the wedding dress
A cute girl with a white humpback dress - a mission (no) possible?
Can the white bed flying the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
The participants in the Plus Size Realty Show "Evolution" will today prove that the beauty and elegance of the valley really does not depend on women's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project tonight will be the lucky ass - her boyfriend will appear on the filming site.
"There are still those who think that the bigger girls don't get the attention of the boys or the sights.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himself, but he likes me what I am, he doesn't require me to meet certain standards," - before showing up with a wedding dress speech show participant Aurika.
The wedding dress is not easy, in all respects, clothing - it is a complex structure, it contains a lot of materials, dress difficult, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women feel that the older girl in the white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident about herself.
I can be encouraged that the well-chosen model of dress really solves this "problem"", explained one of the members of the committee, fashion designer Robert Kalkinas.
The girls' remains in the project R. Kalikinas decides together with the whole commission - plus the fashion houses opened by Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social networks star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukst.
"In deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of misunderstandings between the members of the Commission - because we all represent different spheres and we imagine the winner differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dress has become even more difficult, and that - now I can reveal - has appeared to two young people who have certainly not been worse than the old-fashioned ones.
It was a special evening in all respects," says R. Kalkinina.
Newbies - with the scandalous behavior of 23 years in one summer reality show in Ieva and 31 of the unique beauty of two children, Mom Dovilė - like the other girls participated in the selection of "Divine (r) Evolution" and went to the best 20s.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo sessions of the girls in Vilnius city streets, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girl returned to the show by LNK viewers, voting for her favorites on the television portal.
There is already a second week of international recognition in Lithuania's spectacular reality show - here the plus-size girls compete for the name of the plus-size star in the first country.
Until they're only eight - and they all understand perfectly that the winner can only be one.
An intriguing and unexpected reality show "Divine evolution" week begins this Monday evening at 8.30 p.m. during the LNK.

He became a 46-year-old British actor, Idris Elba.
Although he claims that this knowledge was unexpected, he did not stand up for ridicule.
I thought, "Can't be!
Of course?".
Then I looked at myself in the face and thought - yes, today I look sexually, - laughing at the actors.
Speaking openly, Idris mentioned that this title is a very pleasant feeling that overshadowed his ego.
The British star is believed to have often caught up with the words and customs of cheating, which made his childhood difficult, because, as it stands out, he was "very high and cheap".

Governors do not require 20 km away while building waste incineration plants
The cogeneration force of Vilnius is set at the Gariún turgoise.
Governors are no longer concerned that the construction of waste incineration plants will be maintained 20 kilometres away from their habitats.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee, "State" Kęstutis Mažeika, registered the amendment of the Waste Management Law on Monday Seime, which rejects such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeika, the Group of the "States" has previously upheld the provision for 20 km away, an amendment is required to be maintained because of its refusal.
The amendment by Mr Mažeika provides that since 2019 the electricity for the incineration of January waste may be subject to the environmental and public health protection requirements laid down in the laws.
He acknowledges that the amendment prompted the President's doubts about such an insurance.
"In view of the definition of the residential area, it is clear that it is almost impossible to find places where the above objects could be built," says the Chairman of the Committee.
The ruling majority opposed the President's veto corrections in October, which undermined the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the construction of more than 20 km from the population of the insurance incineration plant, the amendments provided for a permit for the Government to take decisions on the future of the two power plants already established, taking into account the public health interests.
The latter provisions, Mr Mažeika, do not propose adjustments.

Talking about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
On Monday, the British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on the difficult issue of Northern Ireland calling for Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
Speaking on the phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed the possibility of reviewing the so-called mechanism of a precautionary agreement that would leave an open border between the province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which belongs to the European Union.
Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider this proposal, but refused any opportunity for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, as stated in a report published by the Irish Government.
In the conversation, Th. May "saw the possibility of reviewing the mechanism of insurance measures", it states.
"The Speaker has allowed to understand that there is open for a review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not related to the unilateral decision to put an end to the use of restrictive measures," says the government report.
Brexit negotiators do not have an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK and Ireland land border when Britain withdraws from the common market and customs union next year.
The two parties agree on the 'insurance measures' to maintain an open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to be applied temporarily to the United Kingdom as a whole.
On Monday, The Daily Telegraph reported that the secretary of Brexit, Dominicas Raabas, was seeking that Britain could withdraw from the insurance agreement on the one hand three months later.
However, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"For three months or a limited period of time, the insurance measures are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
London and Brussels had previously failed to confirm the information on the Brexit breakthrough in the week after Britain's report that the agreement is reached by hand.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work," said Mr May in London.
The representative of the European Commission, Margaritis Schinas, also told reporters: "We are not there yet."
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of emerging thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, made a statement on Monday, calling for the right to obtain reliable information during the Internet era.
Among the 25 people who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Old (Amartja Old) and Joseph Stiglitzas (Joseph Stiglicas), the Nobel Peace Prize won by Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Literature Prize winner Mario Vargas Llosa (Marijus Vargas Liosa).
"We encourage good will leaders in all countries to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the Group report says.
They argue that "the global area of information and communications" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views".
"People have a fundamental right to obtain information which is freely collected, processed and distributed on the basis of the truth of the commitment, the principles of pluralism of views and the rational methods of determining facts," the authors added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including President Donald Trump (Donald Trump), who often criticises "unreal news", but who is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they will meet in Paris on November 11-13, the "Peace Forum", the signatories called.
This declaration was prepared within two months, under the direction of Ms. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christophe Delwari), the Head of the Media Freedom and Journalist Rights Organization established in Paris, Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Among the other signatories are former President of Senegal Abdou Dioufas (Abdu Dioufas), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and Politologist Francis Fukuyama (France).
Seimas confirmed higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas agreed with the amendments to the Product Safety Act providing that penalties for product safety violations should be increased.
The sitting room was adopted unanimously.
As Mr Vinkus, member of the Committee on Health of the Seimas, said on the new draft, welcomes the fact that the objectives set are related to better consumer protection of products.
Its provisions are also compatible with the requirements of the European Parliament and of the Council Decision.
"My head, the proposed draft law, is better and more specific for all actors involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current criminal system does not always prevent further violations, because the entities who have paid the fines continue to commit repeated violations," said Mr. Winkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the Law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen the protection of consumer rights, give more power to market surveillance authorities and create a clear system of product safety requirements and compliance with them.
As the Ministry of Agriculture states, producers are currently not obliged to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, the Ministry said that the market surveillance authorities were not granted the right to access the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises, inspection, which makes it difficult for the authorities to do so.
The Ministry's assessment, the six-month time limit for the award of penalties and warnings, is too short to determine the infringement, to investigate and to appoint a penalty.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly breach the requirements of the law - only during 2017 did so by 14 companies.
The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed that producers should be obliged to properly label the product and ensure its traceability in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to access the premises, premises and inspections of economic operators that manufacture, supply products to the market.
The aim is to increase penalties for violations of the law.
The manufacturer, importer or authorised representative of dangerous products placed on the market and the distributor, their supply market, would be subject to a penalty of EUR 150 to 2,500 (now EUR 144 to EUR 1448).
A fine of EUR 1 000 to EUR 5 000 (now EUR 868 to EUR 4 344) would be granted to the State Consumer Rights Authority (CPC) or another market surveillance authority if it decided to prohibit the placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Without a requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them, the penalty would be EUR 2500 to EUR 6 500 (now EUR 1 448 to EUR 5 792).
If dangerous products have caused damage to the health of the consumer, a fine of EUR 2 500 to 15 000 (now EUR 1 448 to 11584) would be granted.
If dangerous products resulted in the death of a consumer, a fine of EUR 6500 to 25 000 (now EUR 5 792 to EUR 23 169) would be granted.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria there is an infringement of product safety legislation, a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (minimum fine not fixed), a fine of EUR 26 to EUR 600 000, a fine of EUR 155 to EUR 6 666, a fine of EUR 125 to EUR 7,500 in Bulgaria.

The Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO's most distant and northern practices
Armed forces from Norway participated in a series of difficult exercises in the mountains north of the country’s capital, Oslo.
It's part of NATO's Trishakka Association 2018 exercises - the largest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion after the 11th of September spent a lot of time away from home, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in the warm countries.
But most of all, they are capable of fighting under the Arctic conditions, and these skills serve a great deal now that NATO changes its focus.
In recent days, in the east of Tinset, in the mountains, often in the remotest and most mountainous areas, the soldiers participated in the staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the ability to survive in this source in wild nature, but in the cool climate they have to try a lot more weight on their shoulders - one cup weighs about 50 kg.
The military in charge says that they share their skills in surviving and fighting under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the military, these practices, which, like any other, especially remind of real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

I am a shareholder of several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the possibility of spending more time on families," BNS said Mr Mačiulis.
He also said that he was not planning to participate in the upcoming municipal elections.
Mr. Mačiulis had not yet had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Usack after this Sunday lost the first elections of the Fatherly Union-Lithuania Christian Democrats Union for Ingrid Simonyte.
"If you're open, we haven't yet been able to discuss the results in detail and discuss future plans.
It is obvious that after Vygaud's withdrawal from the fight for further elections, this stage of my life is over," said P. Mačiulis.
He said he regretted the decision to leave Kaunas' policy on support to Mr Usack, only regretted that "Lithuania lost its unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations".

The Kaunas, who noticed the workers floating in Kaunas Castle, will see that the rest of the restoration work is being carried out.
Portal Kaunas.diena.lt, director of the Kaunas Museum Gabrielius Sžídėdėlis believed that there was work on the change of the roof of the protective roof with a protective wall.
According to the feeder, the stems will be broken.
"The scarcity of an emergency caused a threat to the environment - people could stumble and hurt - so it was necessary to change it.
Stogels were no longer resistant to moisture, so they were harmful to the heritage," the director of the museum explained.
Will these pillars be similar to those that were centuries ago?
"All works are compatible with heritage and other institutions," - Mr. Injured added the aim that the result would be as authentic as possible, but at the same time an important and practical side - the ladders must be protected from moisture.
A universal solution has been chosen in dealing with heritage.
Before that, the elements of the Kaunas castle had been charged with a soviet year, so they no longer had historical values," said Kaunas City Museum Director in detail.
The contract of employment was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the work will not last longer than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected that it will be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum expected.
According to him, the value of the work is almost EUR 24 thousand.
This amount, according to the feeder, was provided for in the budget for this year.
The company "Statija" operates in Kaunas City.
Kaunas. day.lt is written as according to studies carried out, Kaunas castle may have appeared earlier.

The U.S. has 28 500 troops deployed in South Korea.
The two countries have been preparing joint military manoeuvres for years, called "provocation" and "preparation for invasion".

The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the TV that the criminal measures would remain until Pchenjana returned to nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet with North Korean envoy Kim Yong Cholu in New York this week.

Eastern European Studies Centre for Cooperation with Two Marked "Smegen Centres"
In Vilnius, which has been in operation for the past 30 years, the US will be able to implement the projects and will make Lithuania's voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We've been working this way for several months.
I am pleased that two major institutions see us as partners and look for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will arise, as we are looking at NATO, security, disinformation, the themes of development of the Eastern Partnership States are also priority for them," Kojala said.
The Agreement notes that the ESC and the US authorities will work together to develop applications for international projects, exchange expertise and knowledge on expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, since both partners have a great international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and has been joining nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
At the latest University of Pennsylvania in the world ranking of analytical centres, FPRI took the seventh place in its category.
At that time, CEPA, whose analysts were repeatedly invited to consult and work with the highest political institutions in the United States, marks ten in the same rating.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the U.S. information space and encourage us to raise a quality card," added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist partners in the distribution of a recently displayed RESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" between US decision-makers and public space.
The Eastern European Studies Centre operates on the basis of projects to be implemented and no targeted grants are maintained.
Among the ESC partners with which joint initiatives are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
On Monday, two buildings in the southern part of France were badly damaged by two people, reported the fire department.
When the building was in the street, the dust cloud rose.
At the scene near the famous old port of Marseille, ten firemen were working, some with dressed dogs.
The local prefecture on Twitter published photos showing a drop-and-drop of wooden walls, a huge space in the place where the buildings were standing, the fire-fighting and heavy dust-covered cars on the site.
The officers said that they were looking for people who might have been able to come after the mob.
Marcelo’s firebender tweeted that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
In the favorite video shown by BFM-TV, a blank cloud on the street and a hand-circuited mouth was seen by the passersby.
In the photos of Google Street View, taken before the incident, one of the broken buildings was five and the other was six.
One of these buildings was clearly poor, in closed windows, with major façade disturbances.
The minimum size of the Marseille area in Sabine Bernasconi said that one of these buildings was poor and had to be evacuated.
However, the mayor was unable to give up the possibility that the building might have been used by people who lived there on their own.
The Prefecture of the Region called on people to avoid those places and to release several rescue services.
The minimum size of the Marseille area in Sabine Bernacon said that the building was poor and it was intended to evacuate.

As a result, more Mexicans are deported back, and these are hard to adapt to return.
"When I was deported, they took everything: home, car, clothes.
They took everything except one thing -- my knowledge," says Victor Hugo Hernandez, director of the restaurant.
