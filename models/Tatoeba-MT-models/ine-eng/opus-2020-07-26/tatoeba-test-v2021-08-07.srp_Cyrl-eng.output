A man has many desires that he does not really want to achieve, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their achievement would be a bitter disappointment for him. Such a wish is also a desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of endless life, and he would want death.
As long as a man lives, he hopes.
