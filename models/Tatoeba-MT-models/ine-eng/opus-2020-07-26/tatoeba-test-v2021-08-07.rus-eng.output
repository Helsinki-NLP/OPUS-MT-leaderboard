A white foot on f3, a black foot on e6, a white foot on g4, a black face on h4 - mat! In chess circles it's called a "duric mat".
White: a1 flag on b6, king on c8. Black: a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. White puts the opponent in a suction position on a6, then only two options remain for blacks: take the button on a6 or move the elephant on any other field of diagonals b8-h2. In the first case, whites move the foot from b6 to b7 and make the mother. In the second case, the white boat takes the black foot on a7 with the same result.
