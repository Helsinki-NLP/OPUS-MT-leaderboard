In my view, the literature programme was formed by women of the Balzakov age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred the Danilev and the Volconian.
They wrote a balletist, of course, in terms of the same women of Balzakov's age.

Matras Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
The Micropacket Prestig model: comfort and natural composition.
The matrix has different thickness of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by a latexed coconut fibre and a natural latex, moderately soft, a plate of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 spring per square meter is quickly adapted to the sleeping body, warning of the effects of "volatile" or "gamak".
In the dignity of the model, breathing materials should be assigned.
Latex, perforated for air resistance, is excellently ventilated in a natural way, as is the coconut.
This maintains a healthy bedroom microclimate.
An extended warranty period is also extended to the mattress.
The period of official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, during which the matrix is operated more.

Germany: Fourth arrival of the coronary virus inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of a coronary virus vaccine will likely not be sufficient for full protection.
This is convinced by the Director of the Association of Doctors of the General Practices of Ulrich Weygeldt.
This is what Die Welt reported on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to take in the summer, the autumn at the latest," said the expert.
In addition, Wiegeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination from a coronary virus could be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the coronary virus Omicron.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of reinfection of Omicron three times higher than in Delta or Beta strains.
The results of the preliminary study conducted in the UAR show this.
On this basis, manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new version of Omicron crown virus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the effectiveness of the two doses of the vaccine is significantly below: “the neutralizing capacity is reduced more than 25 times”.
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide adequate protection against micron-stamp infection," said BioNTech and Pfizer.
A third dose is therefore required.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Infection Diseases, Bernd Zalzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between the second and third indents.
As Zalzberger believes, the accelerated vaccination will have an impact on both the delta virus and the micron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel is very convincing," stressed the expert.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years old
Bet-A-Vib series is a special Bet-A family tree from Pontoon21®.
It (as in the Kalikana Vib series) is different from the number of other outbreaks, because it was originally created with the use of bait for fish, not just for fish.
These outbreaks are greater than those near to the analog ranges, which certainly has a positive impact on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another feature is the upper ceiling of durable and narrow plastics, creating additional vibration swellings at vertical and horizontal currents.
As a "whip" when caught in Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
The most frequently catchable is simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the fan up-down almost without a break.
When planning a deviation from the vertical axis, it is not very large that it is comfortable to catch in a restricted area, which is damaged by underwater vegetation, by roots and other obstacles for which a trap is possible.
In addition, there is a slight deviation in the catch of the winter jacket and the big weed, especially in the middle of the winter, when precise and aggressive baiting is required.
After reaching the end of the tractor, Bet-A-Vib is instantly devolved and returned to the reference vertical.
At least Bet-A-Vib has been successfully applied for the winter fishing of the Prudish falcon.
You can choose from two modifications: with or without a sound capsule (NS – NanoSound).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to disarm a passive, non-responsive, non-responsive game.
The Bet-A-Vib catch shows the distance and accuracy.
This wabler is understood and not capricated, it is well combined with shoulder and shoulder cords, even with large diameters.
For the catch, the hooks, the hooks, the tails or the hooks are not equally relevant and the "steps" are sometimes with the "driving" at the bottom.
If you're hunting in a cornered area, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the probability of the traps.
In the middle of its Bet-A-Vib class, among the most sustainable in work and, as a result, one of the most trapped.
With the same success, it can be used both in relatively small and deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36.

7 thousand Russian mercenaries reported in Libya
There are more than 7,000 employees of the private military company (CHC) in Libya, Wagner.
On Sunday, 12 December, the President of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Khaled Al-Mishri said that.
"There are now more than 7,000 employees in Libya, Vagner.
They have planes, too.
They're also tearing down the trenches in Sirte and Kufre.
They have 30 reactive aircraft at Gardabia (also used as a civil airport in Sirta), " according to Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries were "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their own man into power" in the Central African Republic.
_Other Organiser
According to the publisher, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “placed in Libya”.
"Vagner" has been in Libya since 2019, uses the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the aviation base in Jufre, is noted in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially denied that the Wagner CWC was supported by Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine African countries -- the CAR, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of valuable and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to those countries," the article said.
According to the media, the Ugandans reportedly fought in Donbasse, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not significant in force agencies, nor in the juridical register, and its fighters are not included in the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Remember, the 27 EU member states have previously approved restrictions on Wagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of State of Libya de facto is the second Chamber of Parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamists in it, writes the TACS.
The body has repeatedly called for the transmission of a single vote on the election of Members of Parliament and the Heads of State from 24 December to be at least as early as February 2022.
"The election remains for less than two weeks, and the chances of the elections are rapidly reduced," notes the paper.
In this regard, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the final list of candidates for an indefinite period of time, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy with Russian eyes
38 per cent of Russians see more success in foreign policy than failure, 29 per cent believe that failure prevails.
The examples of success are "defenced in Syria, restored peace there", "decision on the North Stream-2", "the whole world feared that the cool weapon," "We're sorry about the cream."
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with the Western countries”, “exclusion from the world”,” says a study by the Public Opinion Fund.
The Dubai Government has completely rejected paper production - all services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai reported a total refusal to produce paper and switch to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively by electronic means.
The emeritus information agency WAM reports on this.
"This day marked the beginning of a new phase of the encryption of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a totally unstoppable government," said the successor prince of the Emirates, President of the Dubai Executive Board, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Mohammed Ben Rashid Al Maktum on Saturday.
The internal and external documentation will now only be carried out digitally by means of special information platforms in all Dubai settlements.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, HCZ, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government initiative.
The transition to the electronic Government and the digitization of the document has begun in Dubai since 2018.
At the time, according to the authorities, there were 336 million paper sheets, representing 14 million hours of human work and $353.8 million in cash equivalents.
Formerly Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobianin said that e-services would save citizens 2 days a year.

Production and export of Turkish cars fell below the level of 2020
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November in the light of the decline of the lira.
As a result of the 11-month results of the industry, Bloomberg reported on the data of the Association of Turkish Automotive Manufacturers.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released in November in Turkey, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
Approximately 75.9 thousand cars have been exported, with more than 25 per cent of the last year ' s output.
And if the first 10 months of this year's car sector of Turkey showed a positive trend last year, the result of the 11 months of 2021 was already 0.3 per cent worse than last year.
The fall was caused by a sharp decline in the Turkish lira rate, which in November was 29 per cent in relation to the dollar.
This has led to economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 IFRS entities received a delay in credit payments in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, described the situation of providing benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of the MIA Kasinform.
“According to the information of the Agency for the Management and Development of the Financial Market, in the course of the current year, pursuant to the mandate of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency, No. 127 of 9 April 2021, “Approved to deferment of payments by small and medium-sized enterprises”, Alihan Smailov wrote in his reply to a request for a deputy.
He recalled that the arrangement for deferment of loans provided for the provision of loans to banks and micro-finance organizations to defer payments on loans issued before 1 April 2021 to IFRS entities, including IP, from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deadline was 30 to 90 days for the selection of an ICB entity.
The borrower's statement may specify a different time limit for payment.
During the period of delay with respect to the borrower, the claim-claiming work was suspended, notification of the need to settle arrears, as well as the borrowing by commissions and other payments," the premier noted.
In 2021, second-level banks received late payments from 603 ISS borrowers, of which 553 ISS entities received late payments of 9.7 billion tenge.
The IMF has submitted applications for a deferral of 131 IBS entities, of which 95 have been granted a deferral amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Purassev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the strain of "omirone"
The doctor suggested that people with impaired immunity can carry it more easily than those with a strong protective response
Pulmonologist Sergei Purassev explained why the strains of coronavirus "ocmirone" could be dangerous.
It's worth looking for under the conditions of birth of the virus.
Scientists believe that omerone is born in a body infected with HIV or with an immunodeficiency.
I mean, in a mutation, he didn't have any resistance to immunity.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there's these spaghetti-whites there, the spikes, there might be more than that, their antibodies didn't cut during mutations, says Pulmonologist Sergey Purassev.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immunity can carry omerone more easily than those with a strong protective response.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
That's how it happens with pneumococcal infections when you're 30 years old and you're 60 years old.
The immune response of a young man is completely inadequate: where one could only be threatened with a finger, he beats like a rifle on the jaws, - Sergei Purassev concluded.
The doctor also recalled that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the light is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case only symptoms can be bought - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of the body's intoxication -- temperature, weakness, inability.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, throat first, cough.
Right or left pain, abdominal pain can also be a sign of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a growing generation from 12 to 18 years of age may begin to be vaccinated by the end of the year.
The virusologist, head of the GMTI engineering lab, Pavel Volczkov, noted that this category was very active in the kerchief.
For adolescents who attend school, the number of contacts is as high as possible.
This is the most socially active site, as did children's gardens' educators, "Moscow 24" said, Pavel Volczkov, a virologist, head of the IFTI Genomic Engineering Laboratory.
The author is most grateful for this article.

Immunologists have suggested why people with obesity become victims of cholera
The authors studied the liver tissue left from bariatric operations and found that fat cells known as adiposes can be infected with coronary virus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue, macrophages, were also infected, showing a severe inflammatory reaction.
Researchers also studied the liver tissue of patients who died of cholera and found particles of the coronary virus in the liver surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can be hidden in fat tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid immune response.
That's probably what SARS-COV-2 is capable of.
Biologist explained the causes of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences Semen Golosheikin described the causes of dementia and described how it was prevented in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and in time, a person with difficulty is even oriented in a familiar setting.
Golsheikin noted that the most common causes of dementia include neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic disorders and the lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
These include hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the level of conduct, the role of social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
Dementia has also been affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorder, and low-level lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and lower the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors of its occurrence," the biologist added.
In order to prevent the outbreak of WHO disease, it is recommended to maintain the required level of phytosanitary loading, to train cognitive skills and capabilities that require memory and logic.
Former professor of neurosurgery, neurosurgery and medical genetics FGAOU IN RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogova, Head of Cognition Disorders Division of the Federal Brain Centre and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova, told of the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30,000 unlawfully exported from the country of artifacts
In the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to its homeland about 30,000 artifacts that have been illegally smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, 11 December, the Chief Inspector of the Department of the Returned Ancients of the Ministry of Tourism and the Ancients of Egypt, Al-Hayat, announced this.
Since 2011, 29 300 artifacts have been returned to the Egyptian State.
Only this year in the Museum of the Bible in Washington was 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization discovered," he said.
Abdel Howard explained that all smuggled by the artifacts were registered in the archives.
The Department's staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts are “following auctions across the world and selling online” through foreign and Egyptian sites as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored upon return and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was found in Belgium an ancient human skeleton, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find an auctioned by Pharaoh Tutanhamona.
The auction house Christie's held a auction on July 4, at which an auction of more than 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art was illegally removed from the Carnak Temple in Luxembourg in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanhumona, represented by the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and was not on the market since 1985.
How the religion came to Europe, not known.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate illegal exports from the country at different times of ancient memory.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggled ancients are the result of archaeological discoveries of "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are a self-reliance people (near Turks).
If you wish to add to it, only 42,000 people live in Crimea.
Crimean Tatars are a distinct people, and the name of this people is two words!
Only the Turkish language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide access to their personal mobile devices to the bank, says the Financial Times.
The case is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communications to its staff, instead offering a discount for the acquisition of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications operator partner.
Under the applicable rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued to its staff, as they are used to address business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check the mobile devices in extreme cases, for example if the staff member used it to meet a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to a remote working regime, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices used to address labour issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline for staff to meet a new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Essenin, 1925, was fruitful in creation, but more difficult for the earthly being of the poet and his "hego".
He was already outside of any literary associations, he was drifting with imagination, he was himself, but known, excavated, sometimes severely criticized by critics, even maliciously, but the reader's audience was ready to wear it on his hands.
Over 60 poems have been written in a year, many of them are the present masterpieces, complete the "Persid Reasons" cycle, written by the poem "Anna Snegina", published by 8 books, the collection "Russian Soviet".
The main success was at the end of June 25th, when Gossizdat concluded with the Essen Treaty to publish its compositions in 3rd volumes.
None of the modern Sergeu Alexanderovich poets have earned such honor, he is the first!
In addition, this resulted in very good money - a fee of 1,000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, 300 rubs per month, engineer 200).
The funds were needed that year more than ever.
Esenin married Liv Tolste Sofie Tolste, and had to establish a family home, keep Sister Katiu and Sasha and her mother.
Life would have been made of something to be happy, but for him everything was decorated mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Essenina's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
It's the wind that's sweating.
upon an empty field and there shall be no man.
It's like a fruit in September.
He's sleeping in his brains with alcohol.
Many well - known scholars have noted that Essenin has given up, looks bad, apparently ill.
More and more gangs, nerve collapses.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergeu Aleksandrovich has someone who has put up with it, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, as of May 1923, when Essenin urged the fourth woman, the American Eissedora Duncan, restored health in a clinic under Paris to Professor Petr Gannuškin (now Essenin will fall to him two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the evidence of the poet's arrests, the scandals on this ground, the police's charges are scattered too widely by dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the fearsome novel of a poet with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Essenin moved for a short time with a friend, Imaginist Ivan Starzov.
Amazingly, though, Essenina had never had her home in Moscow or Peter in his very poor income, either in private homes, in hotels, or in famous ones.
The old man remembers:
"He only came to night, and in most cases in an unchanging, drunken state.
One day, coming back at 4:00 a.m., Essenin fell on the stairs...
Falla, he's scratched his face and his throat.
With a little in it, he began to cough constantly, cutting up all the stupid blood..."
Yes, and Essenin himself after the war in Europe and the United States (then there was a dry law, but Duncan accepted a proper supply of alcohol):
"I didn't see anything there except the cabacos and the street...
I've been through and I've stopped forgetting...
Well, and he drank, of course...
And I was drinking because a little bit of it touched me."

Matras Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern implementation of the budget model in the premium line.
The base of the matrix is a block of independent dual spring Duet.
Within a large spring, a milder spring of small size is inserted.
This allows a balanced distribution of loads on the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is complemented by an artificial latex.
It's a kind of natural latex, but it's thicker and less expensive.
The flexibility and tension of this material increases the comfort of the matrix.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't touch moisture and dust.
Matras is going to make a big difference in weight (about 20 pounds [30 kg]).

MIDI Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as "arms" against the EU
MIDI Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Jablonsky, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as a "arms" against the European Union and intended to return to such an "operation" next year.
The related statement of the prison was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to the Jablonese, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily “stopped Lukashenko”, but he is “acting actively to find new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As written by the website kp.ru, the European Union had previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He addressed 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they stated their readiness to continue to extend restrictive measures against the Republic, “if the situation in the country is not improved”.
The Ministry responded by introducing a food embargo on a broad list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

In the light events of 2021, barges were dominated by pyjamas.
Please, the first one who said about his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
In September, he appeared at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die" in a bartender male's pajamas and a traditional "Bondove" grandmother.
Following his example twice, Prince William, who first gave the award ceremony for The Earthshot Prize, which did not match the Royal Dress Code, followed a green barber's jacket and then selected a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, a trend was seen by Lionel Messia.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in Dolce & Gabbana's bartender.
His sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for bartender men's pajamas in Russia.
According to the service analysts who went to Gazeta.Ru, they were bought in 1.4 times more.
The most popular hot bartender pajamas with carpets and silhouettes, the main colors are dark-wing, board, dark-haired, and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is between 3,000 and 6,000 rubbs, and men prefer to buy exclusively pajamas - barhetting costume sets they choose more.
You can buy them not only from online retellers.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
This season's luxury pajamas are presented in almost every brand - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
It is considered the most desirable model of Gucci, in which he went to one of the premieres of the "Dom Gucci" Ambassador of the Jared Leto brand.
The choice of expensive marquee can be made to make sure the barhat is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of transversing, wet tissue is obtained with a wet outer texture and smooth inner side.
More budgetary options are made of a boy or a polyamide, but are, respectively, smaller.
Modern expert Lamod Ilya Wahoškin warns that in the case of a bartender, the main thing is not his model or fashion, but the appropriateness.
"Barhat requires the evening light, so such a pizza is ideal if you've gathered for a party or a Christmas event," explains Wahoškin. "He'll come in for the same cases if the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is included in the invitation."
Another important criterion that allows the choice to be made for the bartender is the buyer ' s status.
"The man in the bartender's pajamas, first of all, must be covered with a well-cooked stick with enough, - the authors of the Telegram-Canal consider the male fashion "Krasavčík Brammel". - The owners of the bartender's pajamas usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to advance light activities, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Wahoškin offers to combine the pajamas from the barges with the same items: classic blouses with shorts, one-tonded skirts, shelves, loffers with pillows, wrists.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Modern experts from Brammel's Crassowchik are convinced that there will also be an inappropriate appearance in a row servant's bartender's pajamas at the corporation, and that is, if it's "the leader of those who run this event, "yes," he has such a thing on the subject."
If the employee is below the rank and his goal is to move higher in the company's complex hierarchy or to cut off financial bonuses, it is best not to put a bartender in.
The guide accurately evaluates this with the phrase "not on the Short Hat," - the editors of Telegram-Canal about male fashion.

Immunologist stated that revaccination after 4 to 5 months would help to protect against the strain of micronucleus
Revaccination after four or five months can protect from a new strain of coronary infection “micron”.
Such a statement was made by the immunologist Nikolai Krüczkov, who called the arrival six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, “a large period of time”
"In the past, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure five months later, and in the case of people with chronic diseases four," said the expert, calling in parallel to the usual campaign, for revaccination.
Kreuchkov also noted that early revaccination provided a good titre of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has made two snacks and a booster, or has been infected and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and infected, he has received a "hybrid immunity", that is, an antithelizing many and neutralizing enough," said the expert.
"The Great Seven" warned Russia of the "great impact" in the event of an invasion in Ukraine
The Great Seven countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement on the outcome of the mid-term summit in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have a huge impact and will run a lot" in Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our conviction to increase Russian military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," said the statement.
Ministers further call on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations with regard to the transparency of military activities”, as President Baiden spoke at the time of the video call to President RF Putin on 7 December.
"We reaffirm our support for France and Germany's efforts in the norm form to achieve the full implementation of the Mining Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in the east of Ukraine," the Foreign Ministers of the Great Seven.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have a huge impact and a serious price in response," they warned.
We reaffirm our firm commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our overall and comprehensive response," the statement also states.
Earlier that day, the head of the British diplomat Elizabeth Trass stated that Russia would be subjected to “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed “one voice of the “great seven” countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have a huge impact on Russia”.
Pfizer vaccine was 32 times less effective than micron-stamp
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against micron-stamp coronavirus 32 times below compared to the rest of the disease.
Researchers from Hong Kong University and Hong Kong China University, South China Morning Post (SCMP), concluded this conclusion.
The vaccine was less effective on the basis of an antiviral activity study in citizens receiving two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people have had a high level of anti-virus activity against the Sars-CoV-2 baseline, but this ability has been significantly reduced against micron diversity," said Professor Malik Pearis.
However, scientists have stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the serious flow of the disease in case of coronary infection.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronary virus pandemic, taking into account its impact on the micron-stamp.
The authors concluded that micron-stamp can cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality unless further action is taken.
Ukraine's Mine Defense Head accused FRG of blocking NATO arms transfers to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of the former FRG Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of the Kyiv deadly weapon by NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month, Germany had put a vote on Ukraine's anti-cipheral systems and ingenuity to defeat the unmanned.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position with regard to guns, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, it is the United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Sholtz regarding the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev did not have to wait for Berlin to deliver weapons to the Chancellor of Sholce.
According to him, the previous FRG leadership explained its refusal to provide arms with the risk of developing the military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "unreasonable" position, a certain diplomat, Germany will remain with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski said that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin in the possession of the marine fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to "be a technical partner of Ukraine," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of the present year, the Co-Chair of the Green Party of the Frog Robert Habek visited the Republic, where he was selling defence weapons to Kiev.

We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to give up its aggression against Ukraine," she said (Tass quote).

Discovered ways to return stolen via the Internet store of money
There are several ways to return the money stolen from the Internet store and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were identified by the information security experts in an interview with the RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when the bank card is in the hands of criminals, it is recommended that the principal funds be stored on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the stock may be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend establishing a separate map for online purchases.
If the money was stolen in stores that did not use 3D Secure protection technology, a return procedure could be initiated.
“In the framework of the rules established by payment systems on unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in a series of accounts that do not use the service,” explained the representative of Promsvázbank.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer had the right to lodge a complaint to the bank not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a card on online resources that did not require two factor authorization, the transaction could be countered and returned.
It is noted that in some cases the Internet stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been delivered.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the League of the Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulin, reported that only 11,000 treatments had been received in 2021 on various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the sale of personal data.
She said that an effective solution under current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints on online artists.
Sholz arrived in Poland to discuss "North Stream-2" and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholtz, arrived in Warsaw to negotiate a crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops at the border of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian pipeline "North Stream-2".
Although Shollz has expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unmistakable expectations of one another.
Prime Minister Mateus Moravezkyy of Poland said he would call on the Soltz to speak against the North Stream-2, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany in the course of Ukraine.
According to Moravezko, Russia could use gas pipelines against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking to join the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
Poland ' s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for differences.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the legal party "Right and Justice" violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new Government of Germany, which has been sworn on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has failed to undertake public commitments to halt the work of the North Stream-2 in the event of an invasion of Russia in Ukraine.
US officials told Congress members that they had reached an understanding with Germany of the stopping of gas pipelines if Russia entered Ukraine, a high-ranking US Congress officer reported on Tuesday.
The German officials did not confirm these messages, but Sholz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia violated the border of Ukraine and confirmed that position on Sunday by representatives of the "Large Seven".

The money in the church wall will pay $200,000
The Santechnic, who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas, will pay the prize.
This is reported in the press release of the non-commercial Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the large Evangelical Church of Lakewood, where Father Joel Austin preaches, promising that God - fearing Christians will have wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, Santechnic Justin Kouli repaired one of the church’s toilets and discovered thousands of packages with money and waits.
He handed over the discovery of the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from the truth.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you could've done," he quoted his KPRC TV.
It seems that finding is related to the theft that occurred in Lakewood church seven years ago.
At that time, about $20,000 was lost in cash and $40,000 in cheques that were stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer loss.
However, information on offenders was announced a $25,000 reward.
Justin Coley couldn't claim this amount, because the reward period has already expired.
Despite this, the non-commercial Crime Stoppers of Houston, in its time awarding $50,000 and later receiving another 20,000 dollars in a gift from the Lakewood Church, has decided to reward the integrity of the santechnics.
He'll get 20,000 dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police had questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the church wall of Lakewood.

“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, Pre-Carnaval and Carnaval dinners, as well as other activities, which entail an increase in the tourist flow”, Barrosu noted.
In the past, the Brazilian authorities have forced the unaccompanied tourists to observe the five-day quarantine.
A full protection scheme from COVID-19
A virologist, a doctor of medical science, who deserved the science of Russia, Anatolie Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a pattern of full protection from coronary infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
Immunoglobulin A. The introduction of the vaccine by injection does not occur in large numbers.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And within the vaccine, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antithelials).
And if you enter both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G, but there's still no solution for a double vaccine," the doctor said.
The main prophylaxis of UrFO, doctor of medical science Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of the use of the nasal vaccination together with the injection was the possibility of stopping being a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help to ensure that in such a case, the protection of the body was supposed to be maximum.
Former Minister of Health of the Netherlands David Melik-Gueseinov said that the new COVID-19 pandemic would result in the spread of a new coronary infection among children.
According to him, this was the picture in other countries where the regular wave of pandemics had arrived earlier.
Other, um...
I've talked to a cowboy (death a long time ago) like this - if you're willing to change the warm house, the feed, the love, the love and the games on the liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But the horse was trained and quite smart.
He chose my society and walked home.

I stopped many owners so that they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they said they were running away, 200 grand (pomsky), holding their hand, and running to the other side.
As a result, "200 thousand" was chosen by the owner, not by the dog that ran somewhere.
Mass protests of vaccine opponents are not being stopped in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators came out on the street.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination compulsory.
As of February next year, unaccompanied persons will have to pay a fine of EUR 3600.
The Spaniards, upset by health policy, took a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some have held a poster with the inscription "This is a fake pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, copper-certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, old-fashioned homes and night entertainment facilities.
A decision to introduce health passports has been taken by a number of regions to increase the incidence of coronary virus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand manifestors protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then it got worse in the clashes with the guards.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials applied watertights.

WHO has identified “micron” already in six tens of States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a new strain of micron has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have disastrous consequences.
The rate of strain distribution was reported in the WHO communication.
According to the organization on 9 December, the strains have already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
It was that it had become actively spreading only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of distribution of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are afraid that a new strain on preliminary data may go to the extent of the spread of the delta strains, the same Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading to absolutely no exception in all countries.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gebreyez, said that micron-stemm could have a significant impact on the development of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions also came to the United Kingdom.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that in the coming months, the “micron” will pull out the “delta”.
And the number of patients only in Britain is about 1 million. This is because officially "micron" is currently suffering from a number of hundreds of people in the Kingdom, and estimated to be up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the micron strain, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital on a daily basis.
The British health system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain “micron” was 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
How the micron reacts to Russian Sputnik V is not yet known - it will be understood within the next few weeks.
The Hamalei Centre has only begun testing the Russian vaccine on the micron strain.

Russians warned of a new scheme of fraud
The criminals began looking for new ways to cheat on video communications.
That's what the Reports say with reference to experts.
According to the Director of Products of Ivideo Zaura Abutalimova, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communication is dipheiki.
In this case, a fake video is created by fraud on the basis of real records involving the victim.
Because of this neurosect, it is possible to reflect precisely the behavior of a person.
Abutalim added that using dipfeek, criminals can call a famous video victim or create a role with a human copy to be sent for blackmail.
"These subversives can simply lead to bullying, because a subversive offender can put people in unpleasant, dangerous or compromising pseudo-sensing situations," said the expert.
The leading system engineer Varonis Aleksandr Vetkel noted in turn that psychological people more trust others when they see them.
He stressed that this could pose specific risks in the case of video technology.

Dr. Paula told me about the "migraine of the weekend" in the labor force
A number of factors can lead to a deterioration of self-esteem in the outputs
The reason for the loss of self-esteem after work is often the “migraine of the end-day”, said a well-known endocrinologist, a medical scientist, senior scientific officer at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of ICU, a scientist at the Zuhra Pavlov System Medicine in his telegram channel.
According to her, it is especially common for pregnant women to experience major pain, breakdown, and weakness.
Dr. Paula noted that, besides the week of fatigue, there are enough objective causes of the body's negative reaction to change conditions.
Our lives are being changed in a radical way.
"We sleep long, we sleep all day, we probably eat more, and we eat less," the doctor argued. "Because of the lack of coffee, a small fraction begins.
Because of their overeating and their lack of water, they are a burden and a burden."
A further role is to be played at a later date.
So if you get up for three hours later, you'll have a reaction called Jetlag.
It comes from travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factors play a crucial role in the deterioration of self - esteem, Paul recommended that he follow up on what is the most important change in the outcome.

Researchers in the UAR reported low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against “micron”
In the UAR, Pfizer vaccine has been reported to be low against “micron”
Researchers in the South African Republic conducted a study and reported low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against micron-stamp coronary infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of “micron”) corresponds to the (level) effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5 per cent against symptomatic infections, and therefore... doubts the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, as stated in the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
In this regard, experts have explained that medicine can save from a serious flow of disease.
Previously, in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the micro-stem of coronary virus could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars in ordinary products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
It may lead to second-type diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Users should take into account that under the unknown word the product may contain a hidden sugar ingredient, similar sugar by calories, composition and glycaemic index.
A number of dozens of names can be presented on the label, in fact, indicating sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
Other sugars, such as dextrose (saccharides obtained from maize), levulose (fruit sugar), melase (black poppy), agawa syrup, etc., may also be found.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disacharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in the doctoral flask, bread, etc.
According to the Russian Federation, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to focus on the label and many different sugar names.
Different types of sugar vary according to taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to estimate the exact quantity of sugar, as not only the quantity of sugar indicated by the manufacturer in the package should be taken into account, but also that the fruit, fruit and vegetables originally contain a certain quantity of sugar.
Thus, the total sugar content may be significantly higher than that indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholtz: Gas loses importance for FRG in 25 years
The new FRG Chancellor Olaf Scholtz said that gas imports were losing importance for Germany, as the country continued to move towards decarbonize the economy.
According to him, by 2045 Germany had planned to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"It is in 25 years' time that the question of gas transportation to FRG and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholtz noted that Germany continued to maintain its commitment to transport Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource was now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement that included support from Berlin for Ukraine's energy transformation.
Former Head of MID Germany, Annalna Berbok, stated that the North Stream 2 gas certification process was continuing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that energy projects should apply European energy law.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline is "not in accordance with the requirements" of the European Union.

The hackers broke India's Prime Minister's Twitter
The hackers broke the Twitter account of Prime Minister of India Narendry Modi.
Wicked people have been able to publish a faecal message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized the bitcoin as a legitimate means of payment, as well as that the country had already purchased the cryptographic currency.
In Modi's office, they asked for new messages to be ignored.
The prime minister said that Twitter had responded quickly and that access to the account had been restored.
India's Prime Minister's site had already broken up in 2020 and called for contributions to the fund through encryption.
At the New Caledonia referendum, most voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, most of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted in the referendum against the independence of their territory.
The level of participation in this third vote was much lower than in the previous two votes.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, the independence of New Caledonia from France was 3.51% (2755) of those who voted, while 96.49% (75 762) voted against.
The event was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonian people taking part in the elections.
According to France-Presse, “the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt,” as independence advocates urged voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they objected to it on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago was preventing a full and “honor” pre-election campaign.
Thus, the non-participation opened the way for the third victory of French New Caledonia's supporters, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, against independence, 56.7 per cent of the population voted, in 2020 to 53.3 per cent.
As separatists have said, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and challenge them in the UN.
As told on Sunday, 12 December, in the Elisa Court, the President of France, Emmanuel Makron, should address the outcome of the referendum.
The theme of the independence of New Caledonia has been a great one during the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates to the Presidents expressed the benefit of the stay of France, since it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," said Eric Zemmore repeatedly.
The same statement was made by a candidate from the Republic of Valerie Pekress, who, at the end of October, published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Makron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position “because it is not his responsibility”.
However, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the election of the Caledonians to be the choice of France".

WSJ readers criticised the article on Russian and U.S. relations
Readers The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article, in which he described his vision of Russian and US relations.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West was allegedly making Ukraine a victim of Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger arising from Moscow and allowed a number of offensive statements to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of the year, Hartwell called on Western countries to “stand up against Russia as a united front”.
The WSJ readers disagreed with the position of American professor.
“In this article, there is a lot of false information,” says the RIA News commented on one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to "lost" it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never join the nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," another noted.

Magnitude earthquake 5.2 occurred in the Curyl Islands area
An earthquake of 5.2 occurred near the island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the earthquake epicenter was 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
Ochag lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude in Peru, where ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin to produce reactive pilots of a new generation
The new Ukrainian-Turkey plant will start creating ANKA-type reactive unmanned aircraft (BPLA).
On 11 December, the superintendent of the head of the Office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovic reported.
That is, they are capable of acting against aircraft, against other unmanned aircraft.
Even against a pilot's flight.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish aircraft: a corpus and so on," he quoted his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovic said that it was the reactive and non-violent BPLAs.
According to him, this is a new generation of unmanned after Bayraktar who exceed it “in all characteristics”.
The first batch of BPLA should be manufactured at the end of next year, Arestovic concluded.
ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a pilot was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
Recently, the Ukrainian General's headquarters secreted data on the use of civilian Bayraktar and Javelin missiles during military operations by the Joint Forces in Donbass.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, announced that the country had begun the construction of a factory for the construction of modern military unmanned aircraft.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use the drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Mining Defenses concluded an agreement on the construction of the Kiev Centre, which will provide training for staff, as well as testing and servicing Turkish BLA Bayraktar.
The Office of the Ukrainian Leader's Press Service called the memorandum "a great real step forward".
Two lions escaped at the airport from the container
The lioness escaped at Singapore's Yangon airport.
That's what The Straits Times reports.
Two predators were able to get out of a container with a family of lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were sent.
One of the runaway lions is sitting on the roof of the container.
The animals could not escape from it because of a number of protective nets.
The opposition ended after the arrival at the airport of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which is the head of all Singapore zoos.
They have disarmed the lions with the help of a tranquilizer and are planning to deliver them to the quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Pompeii, the capital of Cambodia, a lion fled from the owner and wandered on the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast came home voluntarily, not to be harmed.
Specialists warned about the threat of vitamin B9
Studies show that the excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned of this.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people with no folic acid deficiency are less likely to suffer from some types of cancer, in particular colorectal.
However, over-dose increases in cancer cells.
Professor of Alabama University in Birmingham, dietologist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the number of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer is increased only if it is significantly derogated from this figure to a larger or smaller extent.
Kitchin recommends that vitamin B9 not be taken in tablets without advice from the doctor, should be monitored for dosage and avoided by milk and other foods containing follic acid.
Former food consultant Rachel Fain called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since, among other things, it is found in avocado, Fain recommended that men have this fruit more often after 50 years.
In the United Kingdom, about 75 thousand people can die by April because of micron-stamp.
British scientists predict that because of the spread of the micron-stamp coronavirus in the next five months, up to 75,000 people in England may die unless the winter measures are severed.
The Guardian reported on this with reference to a study by experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TACS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the Scientific and Advisory Panel on Emergency Situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand summer outsources from the micron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
As a result, more than 2,000 patients will be hospitalized every day.
"Serious measures to combat coronary virus may be required to prevent overload of the National Health Service if the micron stem becomes more contagious than the delta option, and the existing vaccines will not be able to eliminate infections," said mathematician Rosanna Bernard of LSHTM.
The UK Health Safety Agency had previously informed that if the rate of micron-stamp distribution remained at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection would be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, micron strains could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1898 cases of coronary micron-stamp infection have been detected in Britain, of which 633 were detected in the last few days.
On 9 December, the head of the British Minhrav Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.
She wanted to write some clever commentary, but she read it to this place:
"The noise caused by the incredible suffering of an animal and its employment for the second job."
And I fell under the table!
It turns out, "unlucky animal" is a man, and I thought he was snitching!

The demand for superhero grew worldwide by four
Construction will be over this year, and the next year's orders will be the world's record, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world vessel register, the number of yachts ordered was 1,200 per square metre last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have a desire and money for a 50 million dollars and above will not decrease, says the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25 per cent of the courts were ordered more than in the past.
Brokers say there was no 20-year-old experience on the market.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a boat are afraid of land infections and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If all these people had previously gone to the office and met with business partners in person, the absolute majority of them now work far away and the negotiations are being held on a visa.
Broker Will Kristy told the newspaper that the Versailles are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are willing to pay more, only if their yacht was ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such conduct of the rich and call it the decadent.
The wealthy, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in the time of the deprivation of travel to space, the life of the yachts or the flights on their own aircraft is causing an annoyance in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with all mankind.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose that new taxes and rules be introduced for the super-rich, although they understand that this will be extremely difficult to implement.
By the way, it only impresses the number of super yachts, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 vessels 27 are over 100 metres in length.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke builds the REV Ocean yacht 183 metres long.
After landing on the water, it'll be the biggest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool" as well as a underwater boat designed to explore sea depths.
In the existing super yachts, there have been usual helicopters, open-air cinemas, and some of them, such as McGregor's yachts, a platform for singles.A professor of economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gases, carbon footprints produced by super-richs are insignificant.
But it is symbolic if you realize that more than 2,000 people in the world are heard by the multibillionaires.
This is just another example of overusing a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission after billionaires is a thousand times more of the world's average statistics.
If one man produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest pollutant on the planet is Roman Abramovic, responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that fell into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two thirds of the emission tracks were caught on its Eclipse yacht 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner of the boat is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The master may call the captain and give the command to push the boat from the Mediterranean, for example, to the Caribbean.
The superheroes do not express the compassion of other people when they, as the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complains through YouTube that there is no place for their giant courts to start.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a vessel of less than 20 feet [50 m].
Hazardous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of cartilage cancer
American scientists have identified the level of alcohol consumption on a weekly basis that increases the risk of cancer development.
That's what Daily Express says.
Experts have concluded that the use of four and more portions of alcohol per week is associated with the increased risk of the development of oncology.
This increases the likelihood of disease development by increasing the amount of alcohol used.
In addition, moderately drunk men are at risk of cancer of the pancreas higher than women.
The precise reason for the development of such a type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors cause harm to the body.

Dogs can understand the words and phrases of a two-year-old child
Many, and more precisely, lovers of dogs are convinced that these creations are very intelligent.
But they don't even remember how many four-year-olds actually developed.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to make sure that they know how to develop animal intelligence.
Although the oral stockpiles of the dog are not as extensive as human, the new study proves that the dog can react consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The efforts of scientists have been published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or make lyrics, they don't mean anything in politics, economics and art, but they often manage to get their owners back together.
The representatives of some breeds, they consider experts, show the best results in understanding the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, for example, labadores.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of thinking logically and that they do not give birth to a two-year-old.

Preparations for United States and Russia in Ukraine
US$ and Russia will be "trafficking" about Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kotzkov said in his article "Glavovi".
In his view, Washington and Moscow are soon planning to continue negotiations on the United States guarantees that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Baiden on the right to “enter” countries.
If you are offered something that is not acceptable to you, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not be able to trade, but simply send the offerer.
And there is a trade for Ukraine," said an analyst.
Kotekkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine, but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation is conducted in secret, quickly and immediately, and does not wait for the group to detect and deploy the resistance forces,” he noted.
China encourages the development of the rail transport sector
China ' s forward technologies drew the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries to China ' s 2021 International Exhibition of Rail Transport and Production of Equipment, which took place in the city of Jujuju Province of Hunan /Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. automatically enable trains to detect and diagnose technical deficiencies, the representative of Hou Zhaovenh noted.
The high-speed trains on China-Laos, which were put into service at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with these technologies to ensure greater reliability and mobility.
In the last six months China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed the “China’s speed”.
In May this year, with the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd, the first two-storey high-speed electric vehicles designed for export to Europe were combined in China.
At the maximum working speed of 200 kilometres during the train, Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries will travel on the railways.
The pilot operation of the metro train developed by the company mentioned above for Turkey began in November.
The train will be driven by a metropolis connecting the Stambul Centre with the city airport.
The metro movement will be open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese railway manufacturing industry is one of the highest-level industries in innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Fen Yaosen, Head of the China Trade and Investment Department of the Committee for the Promotion of International Trade /CCRMT/.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's high-class equipment production on the world market," said Fen Yaosan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a number of independent research and development, China has set up an advanced rail equipment production system, with a complete support kit and large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yaoshan, the country takes the lead in the electrification of railways and in the operation of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early signs of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences Semen Golosheikin, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementia.
He said that signs of future dementia could be forgotten, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and lower abstract thinking.
A discussion is under way that hearing loss may be both the early onset of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors of its occurrence, said the expert.
Golsheikin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to initiate its prevention on time.
He said that lowering the risk of the development of dementia would help to study foreign languages and active communication.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense memory involvement and thinking logic
“There are recommendations for the application of various ADRs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community,” Golosheikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regular training of cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbies requiring intense memory and thinking logic,” Golosheikin said.
The British Dementary Study Organization stated earlier that the disease is increasingly affecting people over 40 years of age.
The doctors called early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be seen as a visual problem that causes the patient to find difficulty in identifying objects.
Another sign of the developing weakness was the fact that a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist needed to send Saakashvili to treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needed psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who was a doctor's council established by the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakasvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, nature change," said the expert, noting that this is not a normative framework and that the ex-president needs to be rehabilitated.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychonergic rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," said Toidi, calling for Saakashvili to be treated in a special facility that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotaging medical care after the prison staff had subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
Georgian policy has quickly succeeded in eliminating punishment and restoring itself to former rights.

Protests against COVID passports have been conducted in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory certificate of vaccination from COVID-19 have been carried out by Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, the COVID-passports became mandatory for walking in bars, restaurants, sports halls, old-fashioned homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many manifests have come to action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
Valencia's vaccination passport will also be required to enter entertainment facilities and will be restored to more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
More than 5.2 million cases of coronary virus infection have been reported in Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on unvaccinated persons.
The QR Code Single System Bills have been introduced by the Government to Gosdam on 12 November.
Russians are expected to be able to visit places of mass activities, cultural institutions, public food facilities and retail trade with either a certificate of introduction or a transfer of disease or a watercourse from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for journeys by train and aircraft.

The Red Rise: How the Chinese Become Hungry
The Olympics must attract millions of people and help create a country's international court
China hopes that not only will Olympiada attract 300 million people to winter sports activities, which will enable President Si Xinpin to collect 1 trillion yuan, but also facilitate the economic development of remote provinces.
The mountain resort in Zhanzjakou, located close to the winter Olympics, is becoming more popular with Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening work is also being carried out: workers are cutting down trees.
There are over 700 mountain resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts, including Zhanzjakou, are located, there are problems with snow.
The main challenge for the long-term is to provide comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts so that all new ones can become permanent.
But it's still far away.
The adviser to the Game Justin Downs said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese mining industry has changed to ignorance.
Every winter, more and more Chinese are being sent to the camp.
Fiona, a Beijing snowboarder, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to create a mountain culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to develop and create the infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Khulli, not far from the Winter Olympics.
He noted that in recent years there has been a boom of winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, from Beijing in Khulla, a speedy railway took place, and now none of the locals suffer from unemployment.
In the country, more and more shops are opening up with clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes there are points of contact with the guards of the national kitchen.
There's even a COVID-19 test station in Taiwan.
China is seeking to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must be leaders of major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty because of the pandemic reported to WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be put into extreme poverty due to the pandemic of coronavirus, which has hampered mankind’s progress in universal access to health services, stated in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
Two complementary reports were published on the International Day of Universal Health Services of WHO and WB on 12 December.
They found that the pandemic had caused harm in the provision of medics, causing excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the population's immunization coverage was reduced, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
In WHO and WB, it was stressed that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation affects more than 500 million people “in extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their pockets.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish said that the coronavirus pandemic had put more than 100 million people in poverty, and more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: The Taiwanese Minister turned off the transmission to the "Sammite for Democracy" on request of the White House
The speech of Taiwan's Digital Technology Minister, Audrey Tan, on the panel discussion during the United States-organized "Samita for Democracy" was translated into video-free mode, as illustrated by the recording of the summit on YouTube.
The Reuters Agency, referring to sources, claims that the picture was unlocked at the request of the White House.
According to them, Taiwan had been awarded a separate color card from the PRC that considered the island to be its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the world by civil rights.
Taiwan was awarded green as "free", and the PRC, the PRC, Laos and Viet Nam are red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a box with a note that the discussion participants “did not necessarily express the position of the United States Government”.
The CD has not been invited to "Sammit for Democracy".
The sources of Reuters note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could be opposed to the one China policy held by Washington.
One of the Agency's sources stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council was angry with the Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan by a separate country.
The Washington Summit for Democracy took place from 9 to 10 December, with representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia has not been invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, the editor-in-chief of the "New Journal" called for the creation of an international fund through which money acquired through corruption was given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Sovbeza RF Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit was “an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

In the Middle Ages, they spoke of a "poor conclusion" between Russia and the United States.
In an interview with the "Reports", the Russian MlD prisoners Sergei Riabkov assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to disastrous conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
One side is negative predictability, and that's some prospect of improving relations is totally unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion as a result of the long journey that we have been through both with the current administration and with Trump and with Obama.
The problems started not yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Ribkov, the problem is that the United States is seeking to impose a number of approaches on Russia.
The media headlines added that it would not risk providing optimistic forecasts of the prospects for better relations and would not expect a change in Washington position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress had not been made.
However, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that signals will be heard and Americans will listen to sound arguments.
Earlier, the Head of the Media of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary-General Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virusologist warned about the risk of vaccination by a national product from COVID outside hospitals
Allergy may occur and need medical attention, so the first points for the administration of this medicinal product should not be organized at airports and shopping centres.
The TACS reported on this by virusologist, member of the RAN, bioananotechnology, microbiology and virology at the University of Novosibir State, Sergei Netesov.
It is easy to organize the nasal vaccine vaccinations at airports and shopping centres, but I would do so at the first stage only in medical institutions.
The possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small but desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor’s office.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that operate literally after a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it is possible to think of vaccination in shopping centres when experience is gained in the use of the product.
He also stressed that using a nasal vaccine, it was important for her to fall on a slicing cover in the nasal tract.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the nasal tract is drained after injection.

In the United Kingdom, 1239 cases of micron-stamp coronavirus were recorded in the days - RT in Russian
During the days in Britain, 1239 cases of infection were detected by a new micronoma strain of coronavirus.
That's what Sky News reports on.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the micron strain were recorded in England, 38 people were diagnosed with a new variety of infections in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 patients from the new strain in Britain reached 3137.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the Pessimistic Prediction estimated that 75 thousand people could die by April because of the outbreak of the coronary virus caused by the micron strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that introduced anti-risional sanctions
The President's Press Secretary, F.F. Dmitri Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-racial sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive” actions against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “incursion” on the territory of the country.
"There are restrictions on bringing the Russians and not suffering for themselves - it is impossible," said the official representative of Kremlin in the Russian telechannel.
Peskov claims it's "understanding everything in the world."
It was previously reported that the United States considered the possibility of introducing anthrosian sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the Euro-Union plan to impose restrictions that would make it difficult to convert rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank's German Graff is certain that it's impossible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French television channel BFM.TV reported.
Against independence, 96.5% of the voters voted.
The independence of France was maintained by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the Archipelago in the south of the Pacific.
The results were cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the bulletins.
The voting level on the day was very low: about 55 per cent of the population of the archipelago came to the sites.
Experts believe that the low incidence is due to separatists ' calls to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronary virus.
Paris refused to transfer the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the New Caledonian people voted against France's independence in the referendum.
A referendum on independence has already been held in the region in 2018.
The majority of the population supported the finding of an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
There are some 270 thousand people living in the archipelago, and the territory is given a special administrative and territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration is in place, whereby the region can vote on its independence twice in two years.

WHO considers micron to be less dangerous than delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that micron is less dangerous than coronavirus delta.
However, data on the reduction of the effectiveness of vaccines in the new version of COPID-19 are available.
On 9 December, “micron” was registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigen profile of the strain strain “micron” suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the option.
According to preliminary findings from the UAR, it is expected that it (the weight of the disease - order) may be less difficult than the delta, as stated in the WHO technical communication.
The Organization notes that all recorded cases of micronomial infection in the EU occur easily or inescapably.
However, the new strain, according to the preliminary data, is being distributed more quickly.
Two cases of micron-stamp infection have been reported in Russia.
They “were previously immunized”, the Gamalai Center reported.
Anna Popova, Head of Plant Protection, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were cited for Green
The High Council Ex-Deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four developments for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, in 2022.
In his view, the head of State could remain without Western support, as well as perhaps compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko told us in publications on the Glarivov portal.
The first option, Denisenko called the “ideal storm”, implies that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev could face in 2023.
" There is a paralysing decrease in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export to domestic protests and the resistance of power to key FPGs (financial and industrial groups). "
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the development of the situation - “war against all”.
This forecast will arise in the event of high turbulence in world policy, where the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Because of this situation, the leadership of Ukraine could go to Donbassa compromises, which could lead to domestic resistance.
At the end of the summer, the position of the Greens will be weakened, the probability of such a situation, according to the former gang, is up to 50-55 per cent.
The third option of developing the situation in Ukrainian politics is the resistance of the Greens and the President, which is likely to lead to the control of the force block and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During such a crisis, the Greens will begin “reforming the government”, Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the conversion of the Greens to "the father of the nation."
This could lead to a dramatic event for society.
"The compound must be large enough to respond to external partners and increase Ukraine's support," Denisenko said.
This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or an aggressive action by Russia, considered ex-deputy.
However, the Russian side has not once again rejected any "accidents" in Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States were increasing military activity at Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the Ukrainian President's rating was down to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since its election as head of State.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the next presidential election of Ukraine, a total of 21.8 per cent would vote in favour of the Greens, while Peter Poroshenko was the former president of the country, 14.5 per cent.
However, only 19.3 per cent of all the requested support was expressed to the President.

Arrested for action in the Red Square poet: "To quote Eutushenko give 10 days, here's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested.
The VSE student was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashteg #treaty and more.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugania Eutushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the renegotiation of public action had been drafted in Alexandria.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January in Puškini Square, at a meeting in support of Alexe Navali.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now her interest, unfortunately lost, to the decline of a common culture in Russia, and the same little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their texts online under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We have contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal his message in more detail.
How did police officers deal with you in custody this time and before?
What was asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, the detention was maximum, as if it did not sound funny in some context of that word.
On Puškin, the OMONovs took and took hard.
They asked the standard, about the motives.
When they heard, in principle, they saw that if they did not approve, they would understand.
Except for all four sides of the bar, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what it was going on.
And if after the action under this hashtag they start writing their texts, at least a few people, I don't miss these 10 days.
Maximum, according to the protocol, speak at once in the Tumba-Umba tribe language.
In public and official activities they speak the language of the environment so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001 or in the native language through the translator.
This is the protocol and nothing more, in fact, Angela Merkel speaks Russianly, but she is still resorting to the help of the translator.
There is also a verbatim on the back of a car, and the verbatim is not required to know a few languages.

Researchers have described how potato helps to combat age violations
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The cornea contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, follicle and pantotenic acids.
All of these elements help to operate the system of the body.
The potato also helps to combat age violations.
Because of its large cell content, it is useful for the liver and the oxygen tract, and may also help with the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis when used regularly.
However, for the most part, it is best to dry or boil the corn instead of burning on the olive.
Earlier The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycaemic rate.
These are products containing carbohydrates that are rapidly spread to sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Commersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction of its production in personal records and the increase in processing capacity.
In the view of market participants, only imports could be replaced by a shortage of products at the moment.

In 2015, the rightsholders of the RAEC/Media cluster made a list of 100 major pirate sites of the rune and most of them ceased their existence, said the Director-General of the Internet Research Institute Karen Kazarian.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search editions such as "Andesa", and Google, you can see pirate copies of the Netflix series "Game in Calmar" and "Frequentness" by the director Anna Melikan, the original largest series of video services in Russia (in the AIV).
At Kinogo, which is also available in search editions, you can see Encanto's animated news, but according to the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen (recorded in a movie theater, a pirate copy of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through searches, the "Universal" series is available 10 years later by TNT (as part of the "Gasprom media").

Lighthouse made by Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide circle surrounded by the "moleculars" of the light provides maximum uniform and bright illumination of space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and nature of each object, does not lose its relevance and enables it to focus on the interior.
One of the characteristics of such lamps is the insomnia of construction.

Matras Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopaedic spring mattress Micro Ulmite.
The model is comfortable because it has two different surfaces on the soft surface – high hardness and hear more average.
Only quality and premium supplements are included in the product, which have been recommended exclusively for the best.
In the centre of the model, a block of independent "micropacket" spring is established.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bedroom that work fully autonomously.
It is precisely their operation that provides a unique precision setting.
The Micropacket is the highest of all the variety of winter blocks in Dimax, so it has a very pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered a premium.
Fillers: upper and lower of the spring are equipped with combinations of cross-section and natural latex layers.
The only difference is this order of course.
If one surface has a latex, the other has a cocoon.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been classic, since it transmits not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties to the matrix.
If the tank provides proper back support, the latex will adapt the surface to the human body.
The model is placed in the simple triangular Aloe Vera.
It can be made either single or stationary if the client wishes.
The total height of the product is 27 cm and the recommended load is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: 3 years guarantee period.
Matras has received all necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and responsibility for its operation.
The orthopedic penis used in the matrix has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life in Venus
The Massacuse Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus to find the signs of life in the atmosphere, the “Current Camera” said on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year-old missions is to assess the suitability of Venus clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the Venus clouds.
So far, it has been assumed that the Venus Cloud, the nearest planet to Earth, is too acidic to be able to exist there, but probably Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
During the third mission, a sample must come from Venus.
Let us assume that if we find life there, it will become a major issue — whether it is earthly or not.
If so, it would be obvious that life on earth did not begin.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said the Estonian team's head of the Venus Life Finder project Michael Pausalu.

Targets change the Russian business
The theme of meta-population became popular autumn this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the conversion of Facebook to Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the biggest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own metallurgy and subsequent monasteries.
Targets should be seen as a continuation of objective trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in the pandemic has been a challenge for people to break down and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models under them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the asset digitization trend, when any rights, valuable papers, works of art and even money are converted into a digital format.

British economist failed to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict the year 2022, since he felt that such attempts would be a failure.
He wrote this in an article for the Project Syndicate.
The expert is of the view that the next year will be a field of unpredictability, and any trend can change traffic.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of coronvirus, and secondly inflation, it relies on it.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether to increase the price of goods was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of the infinite generosity of central banks has already survived" and the time to return to relationships where inflation rates would correspond to the expected growth rate of GDP.
O'Neill noted that, in the background of the pandemic, the continuation of the supersoft economic policy could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new rise in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to productivity growth, as well as poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Former head of the Global Investment Opening Research Division, Michael Schulgin, reported that positive expectations for the 2022 dollar course remained, while growth potential would be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Sulgin called FRS monetary policy, oil price dynamics and the fear of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But it's a pleasure: if you compare yourself, five years ago, the containers were smaller.

Russians gave around 4.5 per cent of their GDP to auto dealers
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trolls of 784 billion rubles on new cars, 28 per cent more than in the same period last year, the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) statistics show.
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State in support of citizens and economies during the coronary virus pandemic.
Last September, President Vladimir Putin of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization said that this amount was more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia leads the Russian market on income.
In 10 months this year, he managed to make a total of 325.7 billion rubles, almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The Hyundai family brand Kia is growing even more than 35 per cent, and the car sales profit is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, the brand and the increase in the average price of the car - in Hyundai's year it has grown almost 21 per cent, up to 1.94 million rubles - was more dynamic than in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the volume of sales to Korean brands has not increased significantly: according to the Statistics Committee of Autoproducers of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia has achieved 9.4% more than a year earlier in the same period.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota has closed down three leaders in the money market, spending 275.5 billion rubles in 10 months, which is 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Japanese reported a Mercedes-Benz of 266.1 billion rubles (+75 per cent) with the German brand premium increased and sales volume (37 per cent) and the average car price (almost 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"The Mercedes-Benz also has a good sales growth and a medium-sized price -- for example, more than the BMW -- from here and greater growth in financial capacity -- explained the Director-General of the NAPI of Tatyana Arabaji.
At the rate of growth, the fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, as well as significant increases in financial capacity this year."
The Russian Lada on income growth shows medium-term rates (plus 28 per cent) and has spent 229,4 billion rubles in 10 months.
Last year's financial envelopes include companies whose machinery was sold in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
Within 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on the off-roads and pickups of the brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year ago.
In the face of the problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions involving the entire world highway, the automotive companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same AutoWAZ has increased the value of the Lada models seven times a year, the last trip (on 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Prices are regularly overwritten by their products and other car manufacturers.
The volume of Russia ' s car market in monetary terms will be increased further - in addition to the lack of cars, inflation is contributing to it, as well as the desire for the cars to lose the past losses, experts believe.
In the circumstances of a car deficit, I think that many cars have even partially been able to transfer the cost to the consumer of the past periods that they could not have invested in the price of the cars before,
The VTB Capital analyst says on Vladimir Bespalov's highway.
I believe that in the financial perspective, car manufacturers are now feeling very well, supporting the high margin of sales."
The indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the value of cars observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are rising faster in inflation, and the expert explains.
In the long term, markets will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespal predicts.
Increased opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In a monetary statement, the Russian author will continue to grow and in the future, even if the value of the car will slow down, the car producers will be able to obtain their income from volume, notes the independent consultant on Sergei Burgazliev.
In view of the increased demand and insufficient proposal, motor manufacturers are now seeking the highest profit from each car sold, Burgasliev notes.
The increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next half of the year, while the increase in the production of cars is still undermining the uncertainty of future citizens in Russia.
In the light of the market situation, cars have proved to be a bad object for investment - a purchased car year ago, even with a current price, the expert notes.
Byden spoke of US military transfers to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending US soldiers to Ukraine in the case of an invasion of Russia.
That was the statement made by US President Joe Byden.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House, answering the journalist's question whether the United States had rejected such an idea.
Byden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using US troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not in the agenda.
Byden explained that if Russia entered the territory of Ukraine, the United States would transfer forces to NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flag, B9 -- all NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," said Byden.
Former Russian President Dmitry Peskov's Press Secretary stressed that Moscow had no intention to enter the territory of Ukraine.
He pointed out that Moscow saw the problem in the military application of the drones imposed by Turkey, as well as that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
