A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by fraud.
In addition, the Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have since 2009 enacted new laws making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon took place largely after the November 2010 elections, which will add 675 new republican representatives to 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced during the only year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photo and a proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce voting periods by anticipation, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the vote and withdraw citizens who have their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State required voters to present a photo ID card.
India was the first State to impose such a requirement.
The United States Supreme Court confirms the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities were forced to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have been sponsoring Bills in 34 States to force voters to present a photo-identity card.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million older people, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of those who earn less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card with photo.
Well, that's good.
Students, electors considered to be voting more for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their identity card with a photo issued by their institution in a number of States.
On the other hand, these same States authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
However, it turns out that two Hispanic voters over three favour the democratic party.
In addition, the Republican legislators sponsored legislation in 2011 that abolishes the registration of voters on the day of the vote in eight States.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns have contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other States to reduce the voting period by advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in anticipation were Afro-Americans, while only 13% of the voters in the state.
It was the same with the Spanish.
They represented only 11% of the electors, but 24% of the citizens who voted in anticipation.
On the other hand, whites representing 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several Bills have been blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The United States Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, they were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requesting the submission of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules in place will inevitably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the partial nature of the laws that have been voted on and see an obvious objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key States.
A report from the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required for the election college to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer detection: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present wrong results, with false negative or positive results, resulting in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass test tests even more reluctant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was much contamination among the witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another European study concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a test and those who did not.
This study has also shown, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chances of metastases are available if not disposed.
So I recommend a 50-year-old test, or 40-year-old if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolent.
The patient must really be able to understand the degree of risk of his or her cancer by offering him or her possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by choosing, instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many people who detect cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be advised to perform active surveillance and if the disease progresses, they will be given treatment.
Moreover, the criteria for deciding which should or should not be dealt with are specified.
I therefore recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether to pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the value and the value of the APS test.

Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and was moving enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, about 10% of cancers are estimated to be caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is related to 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a big night for people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying from a fall of half cancer.
The weight
Emboss and obesity also promote the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," we added.
Feeding
The Agency also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of getting a colorectal cancer.
The cartoons too, and they should be avoided.
Keeping the meat by smoking, drying or salad may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," we explained.
Vitamins
Over the past few years, several scientists have studied the linkages between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not final for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established anymore.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and his family background with his doctor.
"Passing a test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs Bounne Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boron created a whole mood, last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this bond participates in the responsible mechanism of the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing that this is.
And then, this is the last particle, the existence of which is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "the worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it's not quite sure that it's really Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we have an authentic new particle, and that it looks much like the Higgs bobonn predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still no data available to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume that it's really Higgs, because the chances of cheating look like a lie, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally irreversible law that two things cannot be found at the same place at the same time.
Do not break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantific state" - this "state" consisting in a large way in some of their characteristics.
From there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens named Fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other, the boons, a bunch of anarchists who don't have respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means they can be beautiful and well located at the same place at the same time.
These buds are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, otherwise) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which Higgs boron would be in some kind of a sort of apparition.
These boons, we need to stress here, are not all of the exotic animals that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's thanks to an abundance of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "interrupts" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, a little like a cassette thrown into a pond.
Of this "distortion" is born an electromagnetic wave (of the light, or of the infrared, or of the ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "force carriers".
Champ plus stable
It goes the same way with the Higgs boons, in this difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "intended" to make this boons appear.
However, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it must reach very, very high energy, a little as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could lift the surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circuit ring! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are not all particles, nor all materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep himself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it's not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: the ones that do it have a mass, while the others (like the photon, tend) don't.
Now, what is it that "may bring" all these research, Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also enables physicists to scrutinize any gap between the observations and predictions of the MS.
They are, moreover, several to earnestly wish that we find them, because the least difference could open a door on a "physical new" and shut some holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, not offering any explanation for the gravity (up!) or the dark matter, which is about 80% of the universe's matter (up!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The implications of these research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-World are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Hold: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we were already told by physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - the laser was seen at the beginning as a "labo gadget".
I imagine...
And then, applications can also come from any instrument surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although it was not entirely his original intention, now serves as "eye" to all the world's digital photo devices, and it was valued by the Nobel la physique 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that LHC activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The best way to die...
With his Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should begin shortly as a draft law is prepared.
However, in this crucial area, there is still a lot to be done.
The duty has tried to look more closely at it.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Monterégie apartment.
The cancer of the whore who ran it had left him a two-year-old rep.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-breathing, lying in his bed in the house of Victor-Gadbois palliative care, of Beloeil, where he came to watch.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease is doing its job: an enormous weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilets, and even eating alone.
Attagged in front of an appetizer breakfast, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, reclaimed.
Courage, he even comes to smile, speaks to the strangers who deal around him, bring him his medications, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I get cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man, he's standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the ability of the person " to accept the regression, he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the "medical team and nurses who around them no longer provide so-called " curative " care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die " consciously and embittered " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I no longer have any wishes in life," she said, before accepting that we put a mask on her to help her breathe.
She still looks forward to a final visit from her son from Italy in the next few days.
Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, provides body care and food aid.
It's palliative care, which is given when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At death, we will accept the provision of oral care at the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the daily life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, dead during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the dead.
"We help people as close as the patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but don't look like them.
On the side of a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in court, quietly in his ears while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancers under 45 years of age," concerns Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois' house come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, care designed to relieve suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or at home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that scares several doctors specialized in palliative care the adoption of a law involving euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifeste, signed by the summits of palliative care, whose Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe have been circling to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted to conduct euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid some patients are asking to die just because they don't get adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists rely on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helen Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she left a trial chemotherapy.
When I told my workmate that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping beating, she told me.
Yet, she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who claim to die thank the caregivers for not having access to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which return to sleep the patient until his death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer make it seem like we don't hear this part of suffering.
Moreover, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," that means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a journalism grant from the Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a huge "system", combining the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafios.
A " industry " which cost heavily to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's interesting how the system has been getting rid of since the great means have been taken," irony Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former Montréal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a thorough investigation into the abuses related to road work contracts in Quebec, to which the prime liberal minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to retreat.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and corruption of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, does he stress that the only transport department would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some of them rescinding their instincts to reach a quota party!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen two majors", he adds, hoping that it can "demonstrate the strategies behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also involved with its army of auditors, investigators and government analysts.
More officers of "Marteau's Escoude" who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "cartel des chuouts" to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serious investigations and brought charges for fraud and corruption against municipal electors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town of banlieu.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has been embroiled by repetitive grapevines in exchange for public contracts.
They are formally accused of engineers on the road to Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the Committee the mechanism of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia that returned the money to the Montréal Union, the part of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito seeded all winds in the years 2000, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals then in power.
He also agreed to organize an illegal fund collection for the former Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Cost-increasing out-of-court contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was operating round.
Gilles Surprised, former engineer in public work, detailed it before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pot-wins totaling $736,000, in exchange for out-of-court contracts with costs.
Other road officials reported that they had their stomach spread from 30% to 40% of the invoices, by extra error.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cash with the money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November, sinking Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first electors in Montreal to pull the alarm bell.
Major of the district of the River-des-Prairies, east of the island, it rose from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, full of real estate boom.
70% of money goes out in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, it says that it "puts on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by furmises, to stop gangrene and push the flaws".
The process, she said, is "painful but positive".
We are cleaning up the plague, but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montréal and a guard, so as not to see any suspicious practices come back.
Like we do the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elects in the light of the strategy", when they did not tremble in the bag!
Estimating 70% of the money goes to the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically says: "We told me that it was only a straw reflects the reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100, but this will not change the woman: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral spending, there will be money in politics."
He proposed a comprehensive review of the public procurement and party funding system: "We cannot go any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will enable the house to be rebuilt on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story touches on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who are looking back at it in their own court...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you took a new big deal with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements move me to raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in the foot.
But I don't burn myself.
From my beginnings in the pre-forming centre of Clairefontaine's INF at my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress by floor.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to contest very high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Also, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He was beaten by deputies like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, it is not equal in League 1 and is part of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and won many titles with jump clubs.
He's had big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was out of a series of injuries then.
The confidence he agrees with me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at on the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took our lead.
But we're stuck in a search.
One of our major goals is the League of Champions: we are qualified for the 8 finals in the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our word against very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and join in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, won't winning the title, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we've really got a heart to hit this champion.
Last season, we haven't gone far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media are waiting for too much of the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us in view of what has been invested and players that we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when we get a 4-0 home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it's certainly a little frustrating.
We wonder what people are waiting for more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built with time.
There was evidence in the League of Champions that we could respond to the present.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't been able, since two seasons, to qualify for the 8th final, they've also made huge expenses!
In view of the amounts invested, you could imagine 15 points in advance!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boasted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying it.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the holdings of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
As much as we say there's a Zlatan Dependency.
This means that Ibrahimic is very effective and that he sets a lot of goals.
He's come for it and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This moves others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I was very keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my wound prevented me from bandying with the game time.
I've seen things down there and I'm out of it.
Today, I can make good selection matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
The lessons were learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we must have exemplary conduct.
What are you looking at in the first months of Didier Deshamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) drawn in Spain on October 16th?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I've never had a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
On the contrary, current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and handling costs among stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pairs of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a 30-dollar summit (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are identified on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credit", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and treats exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the network nodes are both depositors of the book of accounts, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring the anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to make sure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner, like a provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file sharing, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "heavy" it all.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular print (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's good.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, for fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaneline because both have different prints.
The computer that has solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to up to 100 million, leaving the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also seen in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Websites providing Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The error used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports opportunities for money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Weight actors such as Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "magnificent balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much about the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus less expensive.
The carrier manages his identity more and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in traders, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photographer and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users have it.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but 2013 could be a turnout," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We're from Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
These are, above all, the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders of refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign military presence, such as the Soviet era.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and firefighters joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deferral on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their unsustainable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their taking control of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Moudjahidin, Afghan and current Taliban government join in wanting to keep women in a lower position.
The most remarkable of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They have moved to businessmen, taking up government lands to resell them in land to build refugees who have come from Iran and Pakistan, who are receiving "a large U.S. subcontracts".
They were deconceived; most of them did not fight for themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have taken advantage of American widths will do: the flow of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have sided the modern world in their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls like boys.
Work will have to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscuracy of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are friendly with mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered as legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will escape from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, eliminating the position of Prime Minister since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the April 2014 elections.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been put on the road, no barrier is in state, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been required.
The noise was spread that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the West was just there to get away with.
Without energy to treat on-site iron or copper mining, no means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to explore the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, whose imports and exports depend largely on, to restore normal reports.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new Treaty of Cooperation provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls', boys', department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "get the hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of bringing together aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" by the Ministry of Defence (Chemic), deleted in 2012, has carried out, and has led to the benefit of a small French NGO, many collective work and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, gourmets in local work, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and increased crop areas.
What are we going to do as a reminder, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would help improve local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests from small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the insurrection of foreign groups, what farmers have told me to do, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled and direct civil aid in their favour.
A Constitution for the Force in Egypt
It's a new shot of poker by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which gives it temporary full powers, it has decided to play its whole.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two months to finish his work.
It was almost two years ago that Egypt relied on a provisional text, several times amended what weakened institutional stability and led to legal immbroglio.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For its opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocrat delirium", continuing to "tract his word" and to "peet the right".
On the part of its partisans, it is assured that it is a way to end this as quickly as possible with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized within 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their intention to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of finding a popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge is angered throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Since this use of a precipitated vote holds the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "It is you who vote for my text, whether I keep the full powers," they are supposed to end after the Constitution has been adopted.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this constituent Islamist majority voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals were missing from the appeal.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had shut the door, estimate that they had not been able to make their views known.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added to the rush yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often in the unanimity that the articles have been voted on.
Comments were also amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee estimate that the pendulum of the constitution was not regulated.
The text, which was still in the vote last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, Article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulates that "the principles of charia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is an indication of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the Liberals answer, who see only a sudden communication.
Because according to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include section 220, which gives Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular as regards the verification of compliance with the laws with the Sharia.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the prerequisites of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also justified by the fact that the next head of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not oulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" Tempera Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be an ambiguity around section 220, because the terms used lend to the religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic case law, etc.].
And in the future, the question could be asked about the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule over them."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly critical because of the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims claim that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
There will be no ban on civil trials in military courts, as human rights associations called for.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticid.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, in particular the press.
In addition, no article is more effective in protecting women, Heba Morayef, of the Human Rights Watch, points out.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself on television last night, events were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will show them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of pleasure await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the size of Bible truths, modern comfort, and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has held five great reasons for returning to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Be irrevocable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who penetrates these "baptismal backgrounds" will be touched by God’s grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fish was miraculously.
It is in this specific place that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But where you find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
The believers travel to the Rue de la Suffering or the path of Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress of Antonia (pretoria), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the place of the Peter of the Onction and to the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is raised to the place where the tree was grown to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also opens the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave them with little words accompanied by prayers that are then exaggerated.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of Massada fortress, former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountain lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a telephone takes them to this top full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 metres above sea level, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski trails are 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to inhabit the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country has nearly 300 museums.
You can't visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the round.
First of all: the Israeli Museum near Knesset (the Parliament).
It covers the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Tel-Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are presented.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha is waiting for you with its Turkish baths made up of mowing of visitors and watchmen of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only Ralli Museum in private where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides and no store of memories.
The entrance is free and gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Scillating stars.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
The three major coastal stations of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature may reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim there all year.
It is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, or 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains the flavor and it is very easy to hold the bathers, even those who can't swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are a surrealist beauty.
It is used to perform treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative sludges and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, ekyma, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also for everything simply relax.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquities
They are kept by the old town of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which links Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, the fate will smile upon you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross a few young married people who come to take pictures of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk in the Roman theater, "conquering " the fortress of the crusades.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourist Note
If you leave for Israel, do not worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (currently $1 is equal to 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, it is mainly the buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast road and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a underground funicular.
The journey in all types of transportation in common costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activities.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casser food, which excludes pork, seafood, uncooked fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
There is a wide range of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also humous, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, soft chic peas balls, falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, we find a lot of well-educated cats walking high.
They can be seen sleeping on the roofs of the parked cars at night.
These kisses like passing places and don't refuse to do them.
The rental of a car varies from $37 per 24h (Hyundai Gettz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Rent a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entry to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists entered the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the visas were cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists debate what the law on compulsory language testing will do, counterfeiters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and states that each migrant worker will have to undergo a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail sales.
In time, however, the Federal Migration Service promises, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language will have to be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will need to validate its language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russia has official language status are exempt.
Persons who have obtained prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are no longer subject to this Act.
Benefits, negative attitudes and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Puchkine, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the University of Moscow State, the University of St. Petersburg State and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative was supported by members of the Duma State and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have asked the question in the press many times: what will this give?
What is the obligation to know Russian will change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, they respond to the representatives of the migration service, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery to work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise for migrants who have no profession, no training, who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is intended to cross the poor people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and his ten similars will be tortured for months without food and paper and will have to travel between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passport, and they don't touch the expected salary," says Tolib Charipov, head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of Tajikistan's Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many residents of Central Asian Republics who want to come to Russia to earn money trust that they not only know the language of the country in which they want to go but also that they have difficulty writing in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tadjiks can afford to follow only a passable primary education.
In fact, their families don't even have what to feed their children without talking about how to dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they get to adolescence, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust them.
"You're feeling reduced and discouraged."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the law on language.
The examinations will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no official examination or work at the end of the day.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defend your entry"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The administrative barriers and still these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the cost of legalization of money: between 12 and 16 miles of rubble.
And then we can get a false record fast for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don't have registration, where the cases of extortion are.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," said journalist Oumed Khouchkadamov, who is from Tajikistan.
"Do fast, don't miss and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several falsified language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
False papers come out of a regular printer color.
Of course, their new owners had nothing to do with them: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the examinations had to disburse seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is twice as much as the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is not possible to simply buy these "paper bags".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first review of the time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian weapons carriers.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: that it is the shootings carried out at the weddings or the murder organised by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who has killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the use of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the gun licence by making it 18 to 21 years old.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the Duma State soon.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "closed the visa".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "the insanity of the pain".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, according to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws on civil weapons will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, today any weapon can be found in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market for weapons is provided through several channels.
The main channels are among five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who has served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Quarter.
Screenshot from a site using weapons commands
The first is "the military track", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those seized by law enforcement criminals.
Baranets explains that both are weapons stolen from police stockpiles and those seized directly to the representatives of the forces.
Illicit pistols have been on sale since military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often suffered explosions.
"The certified versions indicate that some fires have been fired in order to dissipate the deficit," explains the former military officer.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons plants that do not compete with competition on the international market and run the weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow," one expert said.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes craft, a mafia has trained and organized the supply," adds the former military.
Where are the guns coming from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, come from the army and the forces of the order.
Half of the weapons present on the black market have been found "because of the employees involved in arms work", the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are derived from "Clandestine leaves".
A seller and consulter of a armory who has asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these experts in the clandestine research; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys by means of a teaching unit, such as a TT gun.
We're giving her the goods through a grill.
"He transports it in town and sells it for 900 € by unit with two chargers", he relates.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so, when crimes are about to be elucidated, it conducts a control purchase with illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
" Like in a luxury store "
The seller and the buyer are usually by knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to the Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to walk.
The gun price, I got it in place.
Victor Baranets and Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you also have to come by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American pounds with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Small new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schedules, he says, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I believed in a luxury store," the military remembers.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I'm not happy to buy, we go with the forest vendor and we install a target.
"We let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert said.
A shop since his couch
Search engines show Vkontakte sites and groups where we can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any document and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," it's posted on the website "Buy a gun or a combat machine."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the minors?
"Unauthorized, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orthograph preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of false sites and collects people who want to buy weapons of war in the skin.
People cry about food like hungry wolves and then they get to exploit coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military
I heard about this type of scheme: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on automatic bonds.
"He receives back a photo and instructions indicating where the gun is hidden," explains the secretary of the Association "Right to an Arm", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying to the site, you can meet without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of false sites and collects people who want to buy weapons of war in the skin.
"People cry about food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves working coal in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimated by experts, can cost between $100 and 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "Right to Arms", we can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
It will have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the department's official data, compared to January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has decreased by 7 per cent in Russia as a whole and rose to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs have decreased by 7.8 per cent.
United States: fast-food and supermarket employees are underway
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast-restored chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to take over or get out quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of associations on the left.
At the same time as the increase in modest wages for basic employees at Walmart and in fast-resistance chains, the organizers of the events want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Monday Black", at a time when a disbursing rain of money swept by millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggered sparks.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, who work in the world 2.2 million people, left their post to organize strike tickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for low- and medium-sized consumers.
Walmart commercializes everything: layers of hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid employees at Walmart are only running at their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can sell its products in a good market, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter are also complaining about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifts or portable scanners.
The participants in the "Black Friday" events demanded an increase in wages, and they complained that the company's medical insurance price had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For Walmart's basic salary that affects $9.5 an hour, it's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists at Berkley University in California show that if Walmart had increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the increase in wages to the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would return to 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12,39 in a year more than now.
The Walmart participants were pleased to note that the protests took place in only nine States and did not harm the group.
The "Monday Black" continued in stores from 8 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5000 items over this period the second time.
His cash accounts were made in a total of 100 million transactions for Friday Black.
Dan Fogleman's spokesperson assured in an interview at the left-hand Huffington Post site that in any "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "com' operation among so many others" of the organizer's union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and did not concern Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet installed) but McDonald's and other good-market restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases them over time, but on average, its basic employees reach $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me, living with this sum in New York is inconceivable.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living at their parents' home.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about living with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, there are comments on the Wall Street Journal forum saying it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
The demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday at 630 hours near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, i.e. more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also asked for trade unions to be set up in the fast-renewal sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the Protestants of a union by brigades or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, getting rid of the fast restoration remains a difficult task, and for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other stormy events were held near several other fast restoration chains.
The front moment of the protest was the meeting in the middle of the day near McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic politicians, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said, "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other New Yorkers in view, including the candidate at Major Bill De Blasio's position, who stated that "we all have to support the workers of the fast restoration to get a fair wage and the economic well-being that each New York deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event in the fast restoration sector in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not knowing that they were not all fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is for the moment difficult to tell if this mass movement will make small ones.
"For the time being, we only get by the way, by the way, to fool the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies used to perceive the increased reality through special glasses.
At the beginning, Google released this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this society, the glasses are already from the ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in naked air, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Would you mind telling us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time try to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole remains at the moment in the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes in the touchline.
We want to look at 5-10 years in front of us and see the radical changes that will take place with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has made physical interaction, many things occur on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The acquisition of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance is not really at present.
We try to change this and work on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of our physical world to make it more tactical.
For this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to start with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
We cannot say that it is panic: the issue of confidentiality is raised because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we retire to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- That's what I'm saying?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pen to you?
You'll do it with the word and the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or can not do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual relationship.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
It can be such as laser sensors, they produce a pretty good deep resolution and it is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
With regard to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, and this adds to the work of algorithms designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind according to axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames at the second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Batiche, from our Redmond lab, gave the sensors a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand the extent to which this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch it, to have more frames at the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect today has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other, one of the signal receivers reflected.
And the third camera is actually a normal sensor of the visible field.
It does not serve to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or push it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a similar flexible product in Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from a daily point of view of the use of the technologies of increased reality, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitor" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes them strong (the personal elements are what you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is only more accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents point to this idea: there is no tactical sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
How does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be a very good addition to tactical sensations.
For the time being, one of the most interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
She's perfectly recording the pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrason rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of an air blow on the fingertips.
There are also the arms on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Does he believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will still have to go wrong for a long time: the way to trust someone who is physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost final open space - we work on the concepts of racing carpets (to see with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, it only happens on average to fool the brain, and there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The rule of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersbourgeois Avant-garde" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, to the pre-guard of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg artistic scene whose achievements go beyond the city's border and have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this man instead of barbu, all of red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the parties and embroidery.
Kirill Miller's tables always gather the crowds, regardless of their location of exhibition.
He is one of the land-based and philosophical petersburg counters, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an outstanding representative of the Pétersbourgese front guard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance made the inhabitants smile and make them feel good.
He recently took in his hands a barbaric organ and became the symbol of this instrument in St.Petersburg, since he had sufficiently matured for this difficult role because of his existence, philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you drive the city all red and not yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I picked the red as a specializing knife in the appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between painting, image creator and society.
Even though in society, everything that is not gray causes aggressiveness and a negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palais de la culture Nevskiy where my work was located.
I realized it was my way.
So the wave of the old non-official painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to associate myself with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Puchkinskaya-10, which was a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in moving bubbles, they included Igor Vdovin, a fashionable composer today.
When the group started to produce live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg didn't encourage any shows before Hali Gali's time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was when his great career began, but his basic training and education, it was at our home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are the implications of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees have gone there as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Major of the Year", and that's when my kingdom ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- A lot of my tables are hits, they have a very high current and acuteity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a contemporary category.
Before I was a socialist, today it hurts and it's scared to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything goes away, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory decoupling.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we need to crack him at the trunk instead.
And the lie will be eliminated by the distasteful.
- We've recently seen you in the role of Barbara's organ player. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else I can play with.
- But maybe commercial art can be nice too?
- Today, commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liqueur.
A deintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, the people were divided into troops, the Bohemians loved one thing, the next another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred bucks ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each one sees 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people who have been thrown away who come to see it. It's the sexual and social side that's going on.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and at the end of the account is less management, money, all desperate.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to ruin their lives.
When I was young, I was picking up tables that a collector went up next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that are usually the ones that we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and lived in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in Saint Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of the culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that good experts should be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they're gone, because we need higher experts who will evaluate these experts correctly and they'll go a long way.
At present, it is the "king of taste" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for this.
And on our stones, art is bad to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At our house, this bed is very fine.
We must make art the way it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Zoom in on the space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate heating or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with land on board leave to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live on a bridge or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be won, it would be only by hypothesis.
"It is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the Astronomical Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAIkh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to take an interest in the questions of reproduction in space by focusing on the flower.
Another half century ago, there were experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown on orbit did not differ in any way from land varieties.
Then we put on insect orbits, small playful drosophiles.
In 1979, cauliflower eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo develops as a parent.
We get a completely normal dust at the exit.
It is then that the problems begin.
" The problem is that the dust needs to find support, it needs to get on its legs and start moving," explains the director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When there was no support, the dusts were in a messy way.
And at the end of 10 o'clock, the new babies saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The dusts did not react either to light or to sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die at the end of four days.
"We took their eyes out twice, and then left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, realizing the failure of the experience with the dust in space.
The last "miniature ark" with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, biosatellite " Good " will only cover species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it was the only experience. We need to do this kind of research," noted Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their production.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a bad thing.
By losing their normal environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
The wise Homo has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our moustache flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the field of rockets and space.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, there is a risk of losing it.
We have little, even very few cosmonauts who have nothing and give birth to a offspring in full health after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, heroes of the Soviet Union and heroes of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
However, mankind must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero fleetability, the cosmonauts train to extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the predator.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibians seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
To the extent that the baby evolves for about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of her mother's womb, it is easier for her to get used to water.
It is logical in principle, because from birth to first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the swim instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the foster child is a more natural condition, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In tightness, the muscles of the belly, the bass are atrophy very quickly, the baby's push capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by relying on the delivery simulators.
Of course, we can prepare a shelter in a special room, and the woman will be able to get it out.
"And then?" asked Valery Poliakov to ask him to think about this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You cannot dress a baby as an adult with a special combination for exercise.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case when we imagine the birth of a child in a foreign environment will come back to Earth of a disabled, completely disabled child," says Igor Pestov, Director of the Committee on Bioethics of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time, this will become a reality, when the Earthers return to their ships to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Financial Control Institute) said: "The control of the pseudo work independent (Czech " Švarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is at the heart of its application.
That is what Miloslav Kala, the vice president of the Higher Financial Control Institute, said in an interview for Aktuální.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what makes a flaw in us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint control by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Švarc system " by Petr Necaj.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with checks; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be well applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority from carrying out an inspection to demand compliance with the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the House of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project, which compared the public procurement legislation of these two countries.
What was he specifically asking about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public markets and specific national legislation, as well as a practice that follows it.
We have gathered all this, and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not sufficient to continuously develop more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project help you in concrete terms, and what is the result for you?
A joint control of this kind should just help us to make an effort to clarify laws, reduce and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the matter at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and any criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, we will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It might be that this system is so submerged by the paperasse, that those who seek fault will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing it?
In the case of institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesreichungshof, which is organised in a similar manner, also has a slightly different board, but these two institutions are essentially similar.
The skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, therefore it also has a course of such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
The BHR can only control the federal money, which corresponds to the state's resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities at our home are controlled there at the level of Länder's accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designated as a model, but it cannot be said that it is doing better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider to be a model is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage to cooperate with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Markets Act mean to you as an institution?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out post-control checks, we have to deal with a certain delay.
Our observations only concern, at the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "defecting bad management risks" with which we have made the call to nearly 14,000 public markets - these changes will certainly be felt because the thresholds have been modified, as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an excess burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulation regime, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) committed controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the Markets Act meant a lack of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will make it easier for you to control your administration.
So what's the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS was not going to matter to entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Schvarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be well applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority from inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He could say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say we're going to act as if it was nothing.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, just to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder will be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what makes a flaw in us.
The roads are frozen, but most of them remain practical.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also drowned.
However, the network remains largely practical, in some places with increased surveillance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but by frozen and also snowy places.
The temperatures fell and oscillated between -5° and -10° C, but they should be slightly up in the day.
The snowfalls have stopped in the region and it remains in the plains only a fine snowbed.
However, the peaks of the Metalifers (Krušné hory) are covered about 30 centimeters of snow.
There are data from the regional road maintenance service that due to the fog, visibility was reduced.
The R6 and the national roads in the region are now easy to do.
However, surveillance remains to be put on, for example, on certain points where the coating can be frozen and glittering.
All departmental roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
It is still on some of their trunks of iced snow residues and by traffic-intensive places.
In particular, in areas of altitude, drivers need to strengthen their surveillance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and motorways Directorate reports on its website that some of the roads of Bohème de l'East are threatened by the formation of verglas and that snow layers charged by traffic can be found on the roads in mountain areas and located at altitudes.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of glazing in areas in the high altitude region of Pardubice.
There may be a glass in the vicinity of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and this, mainly on the departmental roads and third category.
The I/43 and I/34 routes around Svitaviy were treated chemically.
The snow is mainly found in the Monts des Giants (Krkonoshe) and the Monts de l'Aigle (Orlicé hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a snowbed covered by traffic is present on the roads in the altitude areas.
In Bohème of the East, the weather will be dry today, most often exhausted, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3° and +1° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although, by location, there is a need for increased surveillance and adaptation of its conduct to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures rise from -3 ° to -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication routes may be frozen.
Drivers can expect to cross fog areas, but visibility will improve gradually.
This is the result of information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is almost without difficulty, however, road communications maintenance services recommend increased surveillance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coverage of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some trunks can be frozen in the Pilsen-South district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third-class roads are wet and in this case the ice-cold fences are protected.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less frequent routes in the Shumava region.
Olomouc Region
The drivers in the high altitude areas of the Olomouc region today have to have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remains on the col called "Chervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls forced road maintenance staff to go to the ground that night; according to the road service, it fell more than three centimeters in the Shumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most footwear can be used without difficulty.
"On the heights of the Shumperk district there are snowfalls.
Jesenník's drivers must wait to meet at the "Chervenohorské sedlo" hill a layer of thick and soft snow" today told ČTK the head of the Schumperk district's road maintenance services.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also made their way through the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment performed, the roads are now disengaged and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easy to practice, but in the district of Šternberk the drivers should be careful in the forest areas of the wetlands.
Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions
Since this morning, the North Bohema Road Maintenance Services reported several difficult crossings.
There is evidence from the police that, in addition to some snow or glass-covered areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and glass should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south-east of the central plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are usually dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of mirrors, including around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow source during the day, sky drained and ice during the night.
It is also reported, since the main traffic routes, that there are difficult conditions on national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that curved under the snow's weight until they reach the shoe.
Šimon Ornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those new alarms, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, it is said that we are the only group that is able to collect a remnant of positive energy to relax or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will set up a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project more in detail to our readers?
It is a charitable act that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar announced on 21 December at 11 a.m.
On December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end when the Maya calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, located in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour advance zone compared to us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to reflect together, with the public, on the state of the world that we leave our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a Hymne against the end of the world, which is entitled " End of the Canceled World " (Czech " Konec wyda zrušeno ").
She is already very popular on YouTube, will we understand her at these charity concerts too?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymns will also meet at a given time in the context of a live, uniquely Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also holds the main role of Jesus in the moment, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, because we organize many charity concerts and events...
We strive to make them participate actively in these projects.
It has occurred that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it is fun.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studio training centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and whom we have been working on in the Jedlikka Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students from the Jedlikkov Institute and offer them activities that interest them and show them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlikka Institute, we will transfer this project to an independent new building.
Several music groups and interpreters will be on stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria do you have?
We have tried to develop a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will go on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratesphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other " mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic's house in New York and, personally, once in place in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of persons with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks first.
We have five electric armchair members whose tools are to travel in support, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and toolboxes....
So far everything has always been more or less well, ČSA and British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything happened without any problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public opinion for persons with disabilities and so on.
What has been your experience so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that it is all just in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very poorly accessible to persons with disabilities; there is still no time for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the city centre.
They still do not consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
What must we still catch the most developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements still depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not even very common down there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, at this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather opposite to the point of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the time being, it is only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what led you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at Jedlikka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people who were willing to invest in something.
And as I am myself a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity.
And then, in time, as our moderator Ládźa Angelovic says, we have a little lost control of the situation (retirement).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We understand that if a job is not visible, it's like it didn't exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also make it possible to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you want to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copies each other.
In a way, it is logical: all that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I tend to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But mercy is completely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, we must take pity.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of doing so.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not just an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Is your success not also due to being a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to repetitions twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the routes for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there already in 1998?
Un seul, Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the day of the end of the world, Thursday, 20 December 2012, starting at 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in the arene Incheba, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of the group The Tap Tap " End of the Canceled World " will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to gather funds (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional Studio training centre in Prague in the Jedlikka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket prevention is open in Bohemiaiticcket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of that agency, the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
Poland's road to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde book entitled " Introduction to Astronautics " .
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold audiences and years later Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his book " Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) then became a major promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a promoter of world-renowned astronauts, and his contribution has been rewarded in particular by his name being given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
From 1925 a drone was built in Poland to be equipped with a fired engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project is known.
It is no longer clear whether the rifle should be used to push or stop the drain.
The only information known about this daisine is that of the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rifles.
The research was conducted by the Institute of Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It is clear from the documents retained that this research had reached the stage of the tests.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans for a photoelectric hunting rifle, drawn by the Rohoziński engineer, appeared in the special press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda voietrzna i rakitobamba lotnicza" was published by a writer named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
The two projects had a military use of rocket engines for the purpose.
Just before the war, all drafts for the use of fusion technology were conducted by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczysowy Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work on aircraft was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronaut society (Polish Towarystvo Astronautique).
For the first time, it is a matter of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem Journal, in which there are four more detailed articles on aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowice, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronauts
At the time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research was in the future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautic Federation (established in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, PTA's first president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautic Federation.
He maintained his post until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the co-ordinated development of the RM Meteorological Fuse (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish Fuse to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1800-metre rifle had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Then an improved version was built, RM-1A and during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and was probably 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform specific scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket was developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area with a volume of 0.4 litre, while in Meteor-1B it was 0.34 litre and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litre.
The maximum range of all these types of machinery was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the Air Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
Poland's entry to the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later should be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and in 1978 pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Service Act.
This decision raised a lively discussion in the public opinion.
It is certainly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems aimed at liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the various economic entities and national economic systems are permanently in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital, allied to financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wage) generate tensions over prices.
The following meaning should be added: a producer strives to import low-sales goods to withstand economic competition by " making the price " more expensive, in order to remove a greater part of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy at low prices, or disappear. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and that this is also the responsibility for the unemployment it causes, the social burdens of the State are increasing.
All this situation intensifies the perfect wrong will of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for the benefit of the race.
This situation is at such a public awareness point that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital from them.
In other words, governments place their own population at the expense of private capital without taking account of the social collapse.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically compel its own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is partly due to a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and to restrictions on the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been years of public food distribution points for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages as the State is forced to pay an extra to achieve the minimum vitality.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all the Member States of the south of the EU generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with wages of poverty, on the part of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their countries.
Here we have to ask ourselves the following question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come anymore, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a European wage.
This also applies to all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot invest in capital in its own economy, that the economy led to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly advocates the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same token, the whole state.
The answer to this question is certainly yes.
The evidence is that there is practically all-powerful and present lobby in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the field of corruption, through mutual advantage, in legislation, where everything is punishable but not punishable.
In the RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, the national departments delegate the development of draft laws to firm lawyers closely related to industry.
These Bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The whole of power is not from the people, as the Western-style constitutions said, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that the liberalism-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompeii": "The State has long been in full delicacy and the functions have been attributed to violence.
The beatings of wine, the favors illegally obtained, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption would proliferate without limits and the people would turn to the elections with already sold votes" ... ... "The honest people did not seek to obtain any functions, it resulted when the state remained unconsulted for 8 months."... 'We really began to say that the cure to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had the Pompey spirit, but it is Caesar who has irreversibly transformed democracy into an absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interests of the society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as before, a decade without previous elites, without any effort to carry out deep reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in liberalization without scripules of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a sort of break before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from the old and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and at the European internal level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will be able," says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is "not to forget how fragile we are."
"If my son didn't want wars, he wouldn't have," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her death bed in 1849.
As a result of the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take the part of Israel, asserting their right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling for the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim of repeated killings in its waves; all of them, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not lived the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer the readers a "back-to-back" view on the one to which they mainly benefit from the tensions that have been lost for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East country.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others come from my own understanding of it, or more precisely from the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find an Alexandre the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they had to do their actions on the throne to someone who guided their actions on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated between the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating some powers has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the storm (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s, they have acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to put an end to the linkage between their names and serious criminal acts to which they have been mixed and which have always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they have not yet had such participation (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries was 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after Kadhafi's overthrow of only 4, while Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to defend himself against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of Rothschild the status of the central bank and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I understand well) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue own money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to try a trial against the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree freemason, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the love of such a solution) and finally acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order of chaos).
These solutions are false and still lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeating crises like the ones they caused in 1907).
After successfully launching World War I by the assassination of Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the successor of Habsburg to the Austro-Hongro throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the bite of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier launch of the second world war, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they have imposed on Germany huge war repairs that generate the conditions of radicalization of the apocryphal masses (they then have enough to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, create a Czechoslovakia made up of different nationalities, including a strong German minority that was supposed to play the fifth column (which it actually does) to set fire to the forces and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of the historical Jew with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
Balfour's statement mentioned above laid the basis for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on the one hand and on the other.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had originally held it; or if everything he had planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war repairs imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could provoke a third world war.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be like it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the wars, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of disagreement and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (it is enough to see how people are clearly divided between Israel's partisans and defenders).
Who is guilty and who is victim to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong creates another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where, at the origin of all, we find the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
There must be a difference here between the mere citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as with us, international bankers do not offer people elections except their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascinating, loyal international banker, who is doing all he can to launch a war with Iran, which could, because of its country's accession to Shanghai's cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, since Iran controls the Ormuz route through which 20% of the world's oil flows (this naval corridor has a width of only 2 miles) and creates a destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all new born is seen implanting at birth an electronic gun making it a completely controlled one.
"Let all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, wear a red mark on their hand or forehead, so that they can neither buy nor sell the person who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the person who has good sense takes into account the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to man and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: when things go wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamic students took over the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats in hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation would not offer the American administration a positive outcome, and it could not, in fact, abandon Shah because it would have seriously undermined the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, even worsened later by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The sequestrated diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States sparks a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling.
The Iranian strike strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by the actor and stager Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory in America.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated periods, they were in the Canadian Ambassador's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran by means of a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tour team to track a large science-fiction film.
Gender combination
The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires Hollywood collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company from real offices.
The details of the operation remained long secrets, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several kinds.
It is part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way, but also a "movie caper", the story of a successful blow, of a betrayal - such as in the trilogy of Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
Ambients follow: The sequences of the documentary style Teheran (in the sub-title sequences there are iconic photographs of the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were retransscribed in the film, there are no major differences),
the lighter Hollywood crossings, treated with irony and a little bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with custom men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck succeeded in relaunching his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected stager and his game of actor ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long film after the police shadow " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests confusion and unpredictableness that occurs when a page of history appears suddenly in a given place.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the fake tour team in the Tehran Basar).
Too many actions in too many places
The stager should have contented himself with a subject offering only a few palpitating scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It turns out very well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Teheran airport is separated by a telephone blow in America and the pursuit on the landing track is quite pulled off by the hair).
Argo's weakness is in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it were true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperatives, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and that they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it is shown with a moderate interest, appreciating the realization and style of the 1970s.
He's leading the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history yet, in a certain way, incomplete to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omnipotent, he does the case.
Rules for swallowing balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch a competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, the adoption of a 40-percent proportion of women for the management of large European companies was at the root of our decision," said Právo, the organiser of this survey, Patrick Naker, for the newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, is the recent European Court's decision to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report by the end of the year any other idea as incredible as "the EU's workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", Naker informed.
The EU's contested regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has harmful environmental consequences, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in egg prices.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of the use of the term "to be tortured" or the withdrawal of the sale of classical ampoules.
Quality bananas must be 14 cm in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (i.e. the Czech Republic currently imposes its bank requests by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, because in the Union bananas should not be of a size less than 14 cm or of an "abnormal crop".
The European Commission has defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been lowered despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives result in a waste of food.
The first prize will be awarded in this investigation in the EU regulation of last year, according to which a warning must be given on flammable balloons indicating that children under 8 years of age should not flammable without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American investigation that the balloons are, among toys, the first cause of the death of children by strutting.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age who suffer from fever.
We've got some weird ideas at home, too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone having an official EU function cannot use the name "Macedonian" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Let Fair" bringing together liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has appointed, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union regulation concerning the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU has set maximum volumes for food reserves that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risk a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey considered it interesting to pay money to some countries because they did not have access to the sea and the idea to grant a grant to apply for grants.
However, these ideas are not originating in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea has a disability.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund," said the Minister of Agriculture of the Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the purchases of the so-called "interventionists", the State had found itself with the full stocks it had then to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, led by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), and they were specifically to be used to write applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Wonderful regulations are rare".
If the regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the efficiency of the Union's operation as well as in the area of its overall development deserve praise instead.
More serious, for example, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, fights in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the fight which it does not always win) gives rise to lively emotions in the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomucké vorzóky", for what the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar-based products, not beet sugar, can bear the name of rum.
The official list of EU registered products now includes cheeses worldwide known as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the Lübeck massepan or the Parme jambon, the Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), the Carpes of Pohorelice et de Treboň ("Pohorelýký and Trebońský kakr") and the Žatec wublon ("Zatecký chmel").
The bread d'épice de Pardubice ("Pardubicý perník") and the gâteaux called "Cornets de Horíce" ("horíský trubicky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, how is the idea of presenting to the presidential elections?
It's not a senator or president who counts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been robbed in the last twenty years, that thieves are not under the glasses and taxes and the age of retirement is increasing.
I didn't have the ambition of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that doesn't please me, then I try to make a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate, but you were quickly set up for the Château (N.d.T.: Chair).
Don't you turn your back on those who chose you?
I've always said that I'm going to be thrown into the battle for the Château according to the results of the Senate elections
I then explained that if I had been elected senator, I would be present to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that enables me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation we meet at the bar or in front of our TV station, but we also love those who are trying to bring about change.
This is added to the press that breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said to me that I am subjugated by journalists or that I have been the advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have begun the fight for the Château with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and tax returns beyond twenty million [of CZK] as a battlehorse.
To that end, you have to change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I was a citizen, I was pressured to make tourist guide activities a liberal profession, and I got a cause.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives on the left or on the right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays citizens.
As an independent member of either party, I have much more chance of obtaining the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and participatory dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and to implement it.
Do you think you're a right- or left-handed man instead?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people like me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little to the left or a little to the right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we go ahead.
What counts for me is not that people are left or right, but that they gather people.
I always support any solutions that contribute to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I am also impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal purpose and a vision.
You're trying to get closer to him.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I speak about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about them.
But without Parliament's support, you only have slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will, for example, be able to impose material and criminal liability?
I have no choice.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to get them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I had been elected President, it would not be a problem to broadcast directly on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Then they should possibly explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuses, pressure on the political scene will be possible.
Take, for example, the election of the President to direct suffrage, it was obtained by pressure from public opinion.
I'm starting to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just started out in politics and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm just trying to move things forward, and if that doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person cannot make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves also to the Senate elections.
I met Radim Janchura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the frauds in the macho.
I was introduced because people are really unhappy, but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and what they did most of them gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People chose a Senate that could hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Would you like to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is intact and then I don't have the financial resources.
I don't have any more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I estimate about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, and a Skoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
It's been said that I had an Aston Martin because it was a boy's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in a car, was fighting with women and fighting evil and abuse.
You're in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million-dollar heritage and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I go?
I've already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example paying my son's English school cost 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I would not submit to any election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in the background?
But this is not related to the amount of this compensation.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
It's a good thing I'm living with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be sure, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly built book mountain - 2 photos
"I find that this building is boring, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighboring company, tells us, "Yes, it's actually pretty, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone on the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's going to go full-on in one of these ring libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a Dortoir town that has nothing to attract at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls displays the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to bring some neurons back to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious tips that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small small concrete paintings.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to resume their hands on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam MVRDV architect's office, master of bold drums and creator of mind-filled and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual flag and presented it to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a recharge on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking down, disillusioned and rising their shoulders, Maas, the faced, emplied his books of choice by size order to make a pyramid, and ended his staunch speech of activist arguments by one: "common dear!"
Here's my proposal for the Spijkennisse Book Mountain, or, as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain at the ground jailli.
The building is included in a revitalization project which also includes a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and mytoyen houses for a total of 50 rooms.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this little black bourgeoisie, who so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a mare of a horrifying lazier, whose white façades invite to think that they are opening a laity, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massive, but the true joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you dig the floor of the building at the discovery of its topography.
The interior completely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant reverbers speak without doubt the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public banks, dogs and small boys and girls who play at the dance.
And everywhere books, books, and more books.
"Normally, the library beams are located along the façade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely disturbed the classical space configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Book Mountain has been well-equipped: there are offices in the middle, the Internet library, the failure club, the environment centre and the technical center of the building.
A special beauty is located in the black beams of the library, which are often lambs, sometimes balustrades, or stairs.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the solid building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the Spijkenisse municipality, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found ourselves in an agricultural company frying an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, for years the synthetic membrane of a millimetres thicker is used as a substrate in the trees and fields.
It's a good market and it's time.
The membrane end is used for one or two seasons, then you can throw it away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
Up to 105 marches is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary coffee offers a stunning view of the city, but also of Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but especially contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model ecology project," Trouborst confides.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only sheds light on the inside, even the days of good time.
The thick wooden poles mounted across from the glass façade serve as a parasol, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are dependent on the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic computerist mentioned above, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of Chinese traditional medicine, even described Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkennisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to make a donation of a book from his personal library.
This measure has allowed to fill the voids of the library that was not yet completely garnie (now, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays go everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master's discipline called "the creation of an identity" in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may appear young and uneducated.
This is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request to obtain observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, since it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that she no longer supports the American position.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, without however showing too much criticism of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain from the vote on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposes this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to say defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are therefore faced with several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still working to find this role, but they are on the path of a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as in France or Britain
What exactly does the term "normal" for Germans mean?
It demonstrates the willingness to adopt independent positions of those of the United States and of European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected Germany's position towards the conflict in the Middle East and the absence of the United Nations vote?
First, Germany has important developments in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend the public opinion, but also the elite of the Arab countries.
This is without a doubt a decisive element.
However, I would not give too much importance to it, because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is a decisive element in the German strategic reflections.
Does Germany sleep in its relations with the United States by opting to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are different.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American domestic policy scene.
I believe that the Obama administration has shown a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that real differences in opinion are not so great that they always appear to be.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiastically addressing Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things easy for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They cannot therefore enter a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will play a role as a locomotive in the future and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that marks their independence more.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, and does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or is it always difficult to take on the role of a plan?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable to it and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
This is not easy for the Germans.
In fact, this is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only decreases, but at this point the EU does not fill this gap, so who is it?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's disgusting to them and if they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Market protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are famous brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially deposited in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand thus enjoys protection such that the company that bears the name cannot bear a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, in violation of property law in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes on my desk.
The simulators only need a few additional letters to be able to record their marks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a classic in which are the recordings made at the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by fitting part of the name of Ermenegildo Zenga, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become champions of the world of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are commercial centers on several floors that sell almost nothing but counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his mandate is to attack the fact that the Chinese brand office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
With this term, women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
The financial losses and the costs of justice amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards the cost-effective products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to radiate the suspicious registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports on the proceedings in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the name criticised had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the beach as he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction of Sany construction machinery, the same company that just bought the Putzmeister concrete pump manufacturer.
That's why the Chinese can use a symbol that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo buyer, used before a blue and white logo that reminded him of BMW. The conflict was regulated and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the beachmen of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the view of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the office of the CTMO brands in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have passed last year on a "emergency situation in the course of the work to a normality found".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in the office.
Cost action
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the head of the classification for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be valid for the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euro.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain suspension of the illicit manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the simulator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wenzler, president of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities Directorate in Munich.
The brand office had therefore rejected the Munich objection.
Freudenberg has gained some cause from both of the following instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
The vigour is to be put
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, trialsome and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the past 100 years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing side a "large sum of six-digit euros" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see what this represents for us," Wentzler confides.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to flow to Europe.
This would be the case if copyists in this region would ensure the operation of unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "watchmanship is a duty."
Pattloch and advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trade marks law, that foreigners should rather "register everything that is likely to be protected also in China", as Wenzler said.
Otherwise, costs can be much more important than those of recording.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle at the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licensing rights to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained by Wenzler.
Or then we will lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: foot tap, singer, help
The Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of the AIDS of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that breaks much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we tap the foot: cowboy boots, basketball, women's scarves and men's mocasins are looking for the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers are amplified slowly - high, low, tenor and soprano - and they are carried out, sent and followed.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra chief almost loses his shoe shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We're Monday night, choral Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came from genetics in human medicine at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the hall, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Helping to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is seropositive.
180 orphans from the village of Esitnije found parishes in Germany through the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary education institution.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, we can become sponsors.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal in the gogo center.
Imbongi means "historic context" or "sanctioner of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language properly in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choral repeats songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany to bring her now to her native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres of flight from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitnije, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of persons affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitnije, the worst diseases that afflict Swaziland can be observed on a smaller scale: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population virtually never accepts male circumcision, a measure which nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection of half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is immune-deficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. Imbongis especially saw many children in the street with whom he not only lacked parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is no prospect of any good.
At first, it was just a few people who personally committed to spending a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a warm meal a day.
But only a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been taking care of almost professionally the orphans of Esitnije's AIDS.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial ISTs are syphilis, chlamydiae and blennorrhagia (or gonorrhae).
Common ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis and gale bags belong to parasite ISTs.
What are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and lennorrage are often seen in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contacts between men are at the root of at least four syphilis cases of five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, Chlamydiae-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fongic), lennorrhagia and human papilloma virus are sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of Chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European reports, the three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases was more than doubled in 10 years: the figure went from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess at the level of genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, lower abdominal pain, and the appearance of buttons and glasses.
However, they do not regularly experience any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricant infection or by close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes from sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
Most rapid-disposed ISTs can be cured and the late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the gifts, but especially the funds collected by the chorists through their voices throughout Germany, the funds accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman who is sure of herself and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, at one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, this is what the old women in the hall are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one else is welcome in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for over 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a cooking school and allowed the construction of two hobs. With the help of the American organization for PSI health, the association organized a HIV screening test for many inhabitants.
This is not of itself, because although the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
"The AIDS is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-imposed improvements are, among other things, responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote a little cultural exchange, Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and host songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people at the point of the Black continent still know of apartheid time.
The bus full of whites singing in African is a sign of recognition that it not only creates good mood and joy, but sometimes also raises a tear at a few redout guards-frontiers.
The bus always takes them to Esitnije, where the chorists visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitni is well known in the valley of Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitnije, you will find the light," the people said there.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometres by flight, from back to Heidelberg, in front of these chorists who cover the foot in the repeat room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger survey reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger survey has reported evidence of the existence of a ice cover in the region of the planet in a constant sleep in the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 metres.
Water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one connects the discovery of water with the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the scientist in charge of the Senger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Inescapable of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Naine Ceres planet.
Like Pluto, orbiting around the Sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Telescope Spitzer shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink points, the harder to identify, are the "new-born" in the universe's docking room.
The Telescope Spitzer discovered this region where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6,500 light years.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope photographed the flashing flash of a star in the process of dying.
The ring-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star designs when it dies.
In the immense cloudy trifide, at 5,400 light years of Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Telescope Spitzer photographed this galactic docking room.
The Pleiades, star lovers also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope adds more value to the colors.
On this infrared photo, the nebula of Helice, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years in the constellation of Verseau.
Its similarities with an earthly continent have valued the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular tent.
Only infrared detectors of the Telescope Spitzer were able to capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any trace.
One of the largest and clearest photographs the Hubble telescope took is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the tent, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Australian Observatory shows the nebulousness of the Trifide in the Sagittarian constellation, to several thousand light years.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifides" (divisioned, divided into three), because three dust trails divide the heart from the place of birth of stars.
Astronomers have photographed the prerequisites of a cosmic carbulage in the constellation of the Serpentaire: at 400 million light-years of the Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies rush each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Australe Fire Wheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the cloud of Iris, in the constellation of Céphée.
The nebuliser is 1,400 years of light and consists of dust seeds that are ten times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was produced from optical and radiographic clichés taken by various telescopes.
There you can see the circle composed of black holes that are at 430 million light years of Earth.
The Space Telescope photographed for NASA this group of baptized galaxies Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula the group of young stars is the brightest of our lactated path.
The celestial berth always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the cloud of the Rosette, are also constantly creating young stars to 5,000 light years of Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see more and more in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope of Mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there is the Binocular Telescope Large.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Grand Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, on the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter also reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also located at the vertical angle.
Its particularity has its great light-collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing to the calculation power of its machine.
View on the Australian European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can shed light on the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 pieces of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take any clicks before 2018.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They would drill two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that monitors the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire him.
However, images of the most important space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are inhabited.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space early in 2018 on a Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
In particular, the telescope will have a mission to find light designed by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Mercury Pole is also covered by ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercure.
Radar data have been indicating the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of worthy Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of worthy Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a failed romanticism.
In the vicinity of the many road tours, the small bus cahots along wooden hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which we don't know very much, unless they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and they have a very longevity.
Terminator: Let's go.
The small plastic town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era, which does not entirely agree with the landscape of picturesque mountain.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital, Bakou, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road has only one path.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku has become famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of luck in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight decades of Talysh from the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he's at the age of 120.
Still having a child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Şirali Müslümov would he be mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a generalist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man at the great age of Central Asia.
"An amazingly old person also lives in certain regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the absence of documents, but there was no registration of civil status.
Every day, a deep butter glass
It is true, however, that people in the region of Lerik often reach a worthy age from the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Thalysh have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that food rich in calorie of the Thalysh, who likes meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of deep butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the entire Caucasian region.
She sits on the ground next to a bartender, whose contents she beat unbelievably.
Eight people live here under one roof, one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two little children also chew in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical glass cabinets in the form of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his foulad they hide long treasures of a dark blonde that his son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," added Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes, and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of propaganda is strange in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the fatherly figure of the nation, a man who, however, ruled his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him afterwards.
Whatever the case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats a month (about the same amount as in euro) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good train of life in the region.
And perhaps for a long time the son of Mirzayeva is right: "The elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" neglected in the Constitution
The revolution is reinvigorating in Cairo.
Rivalry manifestations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft Sharia-based constitution is deeply controversial.
The Egyptian President does not have words filled with emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Coptics, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims, and the lay.
Because all members of the confused and desperate opposition are afraid.
They feared a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of powerful Muslim brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, a doctorate of the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be reversed?
The 234 articles drawn up in the autumn by the majority Islamic assembly of 100 people on a 15-hour night force tour are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
That was and remains an interpretation issue, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal manoeuvre resulting from it to apply a more rigorous interpretation of the Sharia.
In any case, it gives a thought to a newly introduced article which stipulates that, with regard to all matters relating to the Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the country's most important Islamic institution and its spread shines across the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would in fact lead to the exercise of judicial authority.
Many of the points of the draft Constitution are on interpretation.
Another problem is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts used to oppress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, perhaps read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morality and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article explicitly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits insulting or defaming Prophet Mahomet or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what is an offence or how it should be punished.
All too doubtful is the wording that makes it clear that it is forbidden to "hate people".
Is it enough to draw the president's caricature or to report a lie to the detriment of a man of law?
Many points are therefore the subject of interpretation in Morsi's draft vote, which, according to his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Regained"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring the chariac down before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we're going to win," launches Hamdin Sabbai, the third at the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, said that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it," says Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet exhausted," said Egyptian media media Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim conference called for a counter-invention not on Tahrir Square, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before Cairo University.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, were scandalous: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Thair, where it begins, would soon have brought about a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's party wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had been expressed high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to allow the people to decide by the guidelines to be taken by the country.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process that should have lasted until February and include all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or in court under Moubarak.
He did not do so because he shared their concept of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term has not even been pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are intimidating to the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto withdraws all his powers," said Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda is lagging behind, including the international community, who looks at the battle between the various political ideology on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A protestant on the Thair site warns: "You're welcome to a monster that will no longer be able to control you."
The rakfisk of Norway: is this the most smelling fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway have one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely smelling fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and salty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the disruptive smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most captured spells.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
The snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, impresses the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-washed wheat and fermented in the water for a long time - according to the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When the darkness sets in and it gets cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that took place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you get a glass of water," said Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time fireman named "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people take advantage of small pieces of fish and fill a large amount of wine.
"Some people prefer the aquarium to rakfisk," Havard added.
They drink the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in water tanks in the air, then released in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well-fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses amplified by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their countries to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is rapidly developing - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedish, their old rivers whose country was not as rich as Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital element, although smelling, of the past of Norway.
This is based on the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to deplore it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians have trouble accepting that in their peaceful country, one of them has been able to commit such an act of barbarity.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has had its wealth in its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success," explains Anna, our servant, at the blonde hair and in the eyes of a translucent blue, the image of the Nordic well-being, with a rakeboard at hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people living here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not want to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with much caution - everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw the money out of the windows, during the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the lines of its well-closed stock exchange.
"As long as we can ski in winter and make a date in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she added in an insanity laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm making the rope to buy me what to eat - I've had my dose of rakfisk.
In the menu, a hamburger made of wool, a true discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying in is one of many places where we use rakfisk to eat and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a noud-papillon, surrounded by rakfisk seats.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are the points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, maybe because of the water abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult start.
While the President comes in, Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take up his post in Mexico, Will Grant, from the BBC, is interested in the challenges that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present.
In a city where bottlenecks are legionate in normal time, a security barrier has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key roads in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidency to become the new president at the head of the nation.
It's a complicated task waiting for you.
Mexico's economy is well, the results of the President's leaving Felipe Calderon, but the country is nearing a war on drugs that has already cost some 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has committed itself to reducing violence against the Mexican people," said Mr. Pena Nieto to American President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the U.S. president, Mr. Pena Nieto was the governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that includes the capital. On its predication ground, the views regarding this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolique municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises are responsible for the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To join the city, you can take one of M Pena Nieto's new highways, an important improvement has been made to these routes, once bottled and full of crevasses.
A new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change are added to its name.
"We count on him to put in place sustainable changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and party of M Pena Nieto, PRI.
In terms of security and the economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without failure, the PRI was defeated in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of the opponents who accuse the new president of missing charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great man of state and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many respects, a banner of the city of Mexico.
And problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military were called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhood, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a troubled area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on a landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto said that, at best, he failed to investigate the problem of the murders committed against women when he was in office.
Unfortunately, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this covered neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports on a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and the body rigidity had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana wears the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old woman, a troublemaker, a pulverizer.
They want us to accept what they say and to rest.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his discharge on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has promised to do so during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress, said.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about maltreatment, the prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter allegations of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been the victim of during detention.
The trial deals with Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping has taken place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of demolishing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being at the origin of the greatest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the American army -- had many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he alleged had suffered during his military detention.
In an interview with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein said that weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter-questioning -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request requiring the Manning case to be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, was accused of demolishing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
During Friday's hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico's military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked questions in Manning and reported their answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment she had reserved for her guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was globally "very professional."
The forms did not report any complaints for ill-treatment, although the officers had directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had voiced concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they had not identified the problems.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet that did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the Special Committee meeting to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to amend his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the close monitoring for the risk of suicide -- for his protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted to get rid of this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and was evaporated once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he had not been kept informed of what was going to happen to him or of what was happening in the rest of the world was very disturbing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arajon, to this cage," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, a cover, tongs, clothing and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or staying away during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also specified that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he came back at night, they would wake him up to see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning questions about an alleged claim in his Thursday testimony -- that after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked in front of the guards and other prisoners one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions, on Friday, Manning stated that he had withdrawn from the order of his guard that he had to throw his cover that could have hidden his nakedness, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to throw it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elasticity of his slip or tongue to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that at least the judge would take into account the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that he would significantly reduce his sentence if he was to be found guilty before a court of law, a trial that should be held in early next year.
The defense stated that Manning was planning to accuse the least serious crimes and to fight for abandoning other burdens that were considered too extreme.
The hearing should be resumed this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
Chiefs of charge against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, the collision with the enemy, leading to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the accused's leaders are detained, he will resort to criminal imprisonment forever.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexicans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two paths: one for the "Mexico" ("Mexicon"), one for the "External" ("foreigners").
I remained real for several seconds, not knowing which file to lead me.
I grew up in the center of California, where my name was called "Mexicain" all my life.
It's an ethnic qualification, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-Americain".
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather was born, there was no need for special qualifications or union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I went to the "foreigner" file.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, House-Blanche.
Generally, when leaders of these two countries meet, their predication themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to go to the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continue the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half of their territory in writing to the point of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an official U.S. makes the least criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints about how Americans are attacking the sovereignty of their neighbours -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite.
And the kids in Montezuma are looking for the trunk.
Yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is what the country has with the more than 35 million Mexicans who live in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the subject of the amerretum?
There's a lot of it.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the vast number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a given time, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark skin, little trained, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we now live the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite in the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defect and they burn us as if we were individuals of lower interest and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relations with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between the Mexicans and the Mexicans, because the Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and the Mexicans are against it.
Although she is an American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexican-Americans I know do not have the impression of being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence want to get closer to Diaspora.
They want the Mexicans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country that must absolutely visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much love.
And if we consider wage inequalities, corruption and violence related to drugs that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to take care of yourself, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexicans still want them in the way that their family members have been treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old queer, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood transfusion seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While the same vain arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem trapped in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
In the Arab spring, everything had been stolen into cracks, and whether or not the veil was stolen, the Palestinians and the Israelis were caught by this regional disturbance.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
However, there are every reason to believe that this could help them get out of this mortal impasse.
A war that doesn't make any losers or any winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to demonstrate optimism.
Even if the ceasefire granted on 21 November remains, this week's fights have strengthened the force's supporters on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will be afraid to have forced the Israelis to leave, even if Gaza has been driven away.
Having killed some of its leaders and returned the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining from the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of their Fatah rivers, the other most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a region-wide power, once the most close Muslim ally of Israel, took root and cause for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The members of Hamas rejoice and say that the growing Islamist has flocked around Israel, from Lebanon, to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, passing through Syria, where the Islamic tendencies can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of Muslim brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, from the most populous and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily inclined to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that will no longer be excluded from even Israel and America.
During this time, Israel's hard line participants will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was placed in a box.
Iron Dome, the baptismal missile interception system, proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unbreakable support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being the source of the last wave of violence.
Above all, however, Israel has prospered, particularly under Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gazan rockets have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that hit the West Bank, the main piece of what might be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to spread despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, of whom the Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman in the nearness of the 22nd January election, has the beautiful part.
Why do these Palestinian records fail by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of their heads.
Maybe the partisans of the line will take it; but the Arab spring may change the woman.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpowers will not help the new Arab governments set up their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is a good hope -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is dedicated to exploding one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and democracy exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains the one proposed by the reasonable persons on the one hand, and most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give external people the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now seek to put an end to the movement of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of foreign countries should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr Obama also has every interest in what Israel accepts to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own plan of peace.
Returning to the White House, it seems as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packages have entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Outside the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since Saturday is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government stated that the aim was to deter young people from smoking by eliminating any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they will never start smoking.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message of tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia records the lowest rates of tobacco in the world and if these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would relaunch the black market, which would make it easier to access less expensive cigarettes.
"The adverse consequences will result from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, from British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had dynamized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, particularly in silicone, to mask the horrible packaging, has greatly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the high court of Australia.
He said that Zico sold it to the wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nude, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population section targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsoring and the obligation for dealers to dissipate cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you have no more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the unmistakable place by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a mere citizen who worships Marlboro cigarettes and who is given the penalty of making a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice - these countries told WHO that trade was unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had had significant trades with Australia.
A WTO decision should be made in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make the package warning photos mandatory in 2001.
At present, these warnings are presented in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you rank the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package on which a picture of a mouth tumor appears.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, the manager of the "King of the Pack Tobaccoist" in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of the packages made it difficult to arrange the packages on the stands.
"Before, I needed an hour to download a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them for a good time and we would have said OK, that's good, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a world that is constantly connected, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I've had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending a half-day at an airport to wait for a flight is rather boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child commend the nuisance.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get busy in time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting ways, or even feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of the nuisance.
So should we welcome the open-handed nuisance?
Yeah.
You don't.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The nest rises very far," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii, there are Latin graffiti that evoke the ennui, they rise in the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to the nuisance.
The problem is that it was defined, and discussed in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After spending many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the nuisance as an experience that is "to want to do something but not succeed in a satisfying activity."
What distinguishes the nuisance of apathy, he says, is that the person is not doing a task that she would like to do.
With apathy, he said, there's no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of the boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the care process, associated with a lousy mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Nausea can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both of them can be connected, people who are dating tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we may think that we are bored when it is actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard from the next room that it was too high for a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the band sound at all.
Those who heard the TV at a low sound level said that they were more upset than the two other groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they didn't know why, and they attributed this problem of concentration to the trouble.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or demanding task, a interruption of attention can lead to frustration, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like looking at objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says, at present, we know that when we are tortured or grumbled, these gestures, often considered as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigotare learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to stay unmoved," said Professor Fenske.
We are all bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monocorded voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "Scaling Predisposition Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Some of the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have the time to do anything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied incentives.
In general, however, teenagers are quickly praised.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, had an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during their homework duties, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether today's percentages of boredom, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adultness is a period when the nuisance reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is the boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to make money or to abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have referred to a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The trouble is the way the brain found out that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology in the United States.
But the brain doesn't always know what the right thing to do is.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-control, says Professor Fenske.
And "that's legally going from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the nuisance.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him anymore.
To feel at ease outside the constant bubbling that generates activities and technology is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to worry more often, but the nuisance awakens a strong and french desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the time to stop.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, there is no directive for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying at a college and football player in Colorado, is indicted for something that will soon become legal in his condition: the possession of marijuana bottles and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to compare possession of drugs and materials that could serve his consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one of them?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legitimize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been immediately classified.
Police services stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the most conservative districts of Colorado called for speeding up the existing maritime affairs and continued to indict those who possessed them.
At the same time, several cities from the Denver plains to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of sales of marijuana approved by the State in their neighborhoods.
"The things evolve so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of the Aurora police, east of Denver.
The government's regulatory bodies in Washington also have no questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the date of delivery of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is veiled or not, is in progress on most of the regulations on marijuana, first of all for therapeutic use and now for personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and it is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, as Mr. Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real past on which we could be based," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal void of one year, during which the licensing system will not always exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical issues remain pending: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees adequate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or creek.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis sales trade, particularly in the Metropolitan Zone of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Cannabis Law Center, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City of Atorney" (representative of the public ministry) would no longer pursue persons aged 21 and over who had small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop indicting people for this type of crime "immediately."
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new judicial decisions governing the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, the "attorney district" (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, incarnates a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on users to detoxify.
At present, 119 people are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to try to prosecute those people who committed an offence that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were even complicated in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer compare adults to have limited quantities.
The representative of the county's public ministry, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all Marijuana detention cases without delay.
"I don't feel like wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalentity among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"It is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents people accused of using marijuana and who speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent a good part of their life pursuing in justice the people who consumed marijuana, too, have a hard time accepting it as legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case of case-law for the legalization of drugs.
While the defenders and representatives of the State provide for a new legalized sales border, they look forward with concern to the federal government's directives, which always design the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will resign.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police are probably not going to get the doors to grab small packs of drugs, there is strong evidence that they are opposed to approved sales of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Before the polls, some local authorities approved moratoriums on the creation of new sales of marijuana, even if this was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the vote of the State.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford because I was a "tory" (conservatory).
They are not only students today who are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was an excellent place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates both pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father fell apart and went to tears.
My friends were disappointed.
The L'Evenning Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with pleasure that I was going after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I ran away because I was a victim of intimidation and subjected to constant brilliance.
Not because of my name, not because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this so-called berth, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservative Party.
Why call it today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students is subject to the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford was such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the Student Hall (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and undesirable" because of their political views.
They wish there to be a representative in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wunderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Country of Wonders: Young, Smart and Right"), devoted to student policy, which identified "Tories" as eccentrics and neonazis.
Among other things, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves in Rolls-Royce, is a fully silvered tree and moves with a chromed cane.
In other universities, conservative students are said to be treated as emissaries of the introduction of higher education costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, said in a Sunday newspaper "that there was a left-wing party growing in universities.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, who studied history in Corpus Christi, who proposed a movement for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, President of the OCA, said that there was a deterioration in the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate and to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think about that during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered September 1986, I was then 18 years old and a paralysing shyness.
The hate of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted in favour of the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcoming week, when the new students got acquainted with the others and the teachers, I had a taste for what was going to happen next.
I found that not only did the teachers participate in sarcasm with the Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on gross minors, the privatisation and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were being recorded in the woodwork of classrooms.
The first sarcasm to which I was victim concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a cheeky face, took it easy.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he started with a bit of anger.
I'm back in my room, uncomfortable.
During dinner tonight, I sat alone and I felt a slight tape on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," he said, politely.
I'm really afraid he'll do that.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is taken for a target.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be harder for you.
Most of Tory's young people claim to be workers.
Later, in the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagree with all that Mrs Thatcher said.
This strategy failed.
A first year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences who ironically studied in Eton said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took over the refraction.
I was a pervert, you know?
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I just live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I become a Labourer and reinstate my opinions?
The next three years would be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a political advisor to Thatcher's foreign policy and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his accession to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to make the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and friends more open to mind.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was incredible.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreams bells.
Even my Communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's for you to touch.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Fatigued by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session headed the following week, when another history professor suggested the world's most serious, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
I've allowed myself to be the victim of the brainwashing of my parents and the treatment of "old fool".
The tail was short-lived.
It's my father who sunk the last block of my octopus.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers left.
When they left, I made my bag and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with pleurnichard wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 First Ministers of Tory, but also benefited from an unmistakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", opened this week in London, ABC asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian tailors.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital to welcome an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The tailor recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 models of high leather created for his cooking home in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the starting point of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest tailor of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, to the icon of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving the kingdom.
"At least they don't break their cigarette bubbles on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his Gstaad chalet," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past-time beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine Mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charism of the tailor.
A few years ago, after a show on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," he recalled the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go fashion, for its creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobelsse line display
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
He loves the people who are very high and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamour podium of sixty meters wide that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the mannequins place and has to show on the podium to admire a "public" dream with the main creations of Valentino, such as the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage to Aristote Onassis, the custom that Monica Vitti wore in "La Night", or a woolen and fur coat belonging to Emperor Farah Diba.
Among this public of mannequins are names such as Sybile de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the cook in 2006
Many of her clients say the first Valentine's clothes are like the first love, "not to be forgotten".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest, and a dress from the 1971-1972 autumn winter collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the curator's museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he exalts our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and they shine the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can't forget the first time she brought a Valentine's model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a wheeled skirt, a draped pocket and a drop-off.
"It was a dream that became a reality," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the imporel," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg preserves the night clothes of the tailor with "the greatest care, because a night's dress is not only a dress, it's also all the memories she's driving".
The "king" of fashion
The great end of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress, which took place at his wedding with Paul de Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the knifer calls his shirts) to make this dress in Ivorian silk with pearl incrustations, twelve kinds of different teeth and a four-metre-and-a-half-metre train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high leather of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obubated for years by the "savour-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Labouro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated by the Legion d'Honeur, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of its clients' wives.
"His refinery, his calmness, his well-being and perfect look always jumped me in the eye," says Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"It was impeccable, years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says...
The hardest business in the world: the human dead of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 pounds of sulphur through the paved stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by bringing the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from ground drains strengthens its contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which are about 70 kilos long, he installs them in two bamboo panels that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, reaching 2,386 meters high, but the exhausted carriers are putting more than 40 minutes to burn this distance, with a tortoise all around, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the precipitation.
They know that a mistake could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who fell dead in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The Kawah Ijen minors earn 5 cents euros for each kilo of extracted sulphur.
Once above, it breaks a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and painfully carrying heavy banners, they walk 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little contrapassion at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960, and it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian clothes (5 cents euros) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells 10,000 rupees (83 cents euros) to the petrochemical industry as this miner is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serve to whiten the sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 clothes (EUR 3.8) on each trip," explains Anto, who generally makes three trips per day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138 000 clothes (€11.50) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees per day (EUR 1.20) and where the monthly average wage is two million rupees (167)", says the carrier who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 clothes per day (6,20 euros) and the job was not so difficult, but Ando returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sufferer: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought him back to Java for her conversion to Islam".
And he suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, all the time and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three of his life exposing the danger on the Kawah lien, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
And he suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, all the time and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French" he promises in more than acceptable English.
Intimidated by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a server or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a morgue.
It shares an insanity of wood with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the souffice does not cease to rejoice at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and bright in the middle of the darkness.
Resisting the darkness, Ando went down into the crater by lighting himself with a little lamp fixed to his helmet, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 wearers charge the sulphur panels on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work at their expense and are paid at the cost.
Moreover, they no longer touch one of the 30,000 clothes (EUR 2.50) by photo equipment, in addition to the 15 000 clothes (EUR 1.20), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human dead.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpoliner who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
He can carry up to 110 pounds, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so intense that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... that their usual breathing problems, arthritis, knee pain and shoulders are obviously added to their usual problems, which are deformed by the weight of the pancreas.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 pounds.
Every day, his companions and they extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to Tamansari's warehouse, 18 kilometres from there through a path of goats invaded by the bad herbs.
"I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life," Unainik says by opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The elderly of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the eternal misery of generation is one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the one that makes the human morgues of the Kawah lichen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans place responsibility for this absence of children on the career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unmistakable that these words come from an advertisement for pastils at the mint, but in spite of this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video spread as a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinella in the trigger" to soften Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency from the source of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people would "fill their national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we should address.
We knew that the government had tried a number of things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not work properly.
So we are saying the following: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year in politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered to be the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, states that this was due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the formation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created a sense within the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that abound with a degumised xenophobia against new immigrants, particularly Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore last year experienced its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known as a shoebox, which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than the larger housings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these buildings are built much faster than those of the larger size.
That's why it's much more profitable for our treasure.
However, he admitted that the new standards provided clearer instructions to the promoters, who had previously been putting sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too little housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeians working in the financial district of the centre, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, like education, so that's why people send it back later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another 20-year-old tells us.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What's private off the line is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Dictionary of the Royal Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the sphere of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What does this involve in the private domain for at least 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by spreading on the Internet of events that he would certainly not be sharing out of line?
The newspaper ElPeriodico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on the personal level and "password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not disclose my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I put nice pictures or games.
I'm also discussing with my friends.
"I will not share one of my photos or anyone who would make the fool," he said.
The young boy recognized that it was wrong to publish obscenest photos, naked persons, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
In fact, her mother knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he added.
"The social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he said.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will not trust anyone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, aged 14, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"That doesn't bother me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the young boy, no one has made any progress or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I'd just delete it from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyberhark are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was" he made sure.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only passed it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post knowledge photos in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyberharkment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way of looking for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in education at Yale University and author of the book "Naturals and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what to disclose, publish or say to an age where they do not have the maturity needed to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"They say not to do it is of no use," she says.
Then, Porras cites some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every minute?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
Those are the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be the same on social networks," she said.
Surveillance
Esturdo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and education advisor, states that it is essential for parents to read the terms of use of social networks consciously.
With each term, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he said.
According to the Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to speak to strangers.
The Unasur Summit ended without the declaration of Lima being made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) has now ended in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, although it has been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 current mandates.
Efé tried several times to access the document signed at the Sixth Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported that it would be disclosed after the closure of the summit, and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government website.
When they were questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by Peru's President Ollante Humala in short press statements.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the Presidential Assembly sound with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The few information circulating among journalists was given by the press officers of some of the Governments of the Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of the present presidents, which caused a number of Malaysians among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who claimed more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd Summit of South-Arab States (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this has been requested by the press, it has not yet published the statement called also the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA site, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Hague Court which concluded a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the complainants from both sides in the trial that Lima attempted against Santiago and which began Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we have before this international court today," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country in accordance with international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," President Pinjera added, giving the President Humala a handhold next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Covenant by which it agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The mandate officer read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he noted that the countries of the United States would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of residence permits agreements".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, access to the low-priced Internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and bring about a better future for our populations," said President Humala.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the President of Peru during a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were Peru and were on the cross-sectional axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador although it did not give more details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, which will call for a discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," President Santos added.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to attend the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In the same way, in the framework of the summit, the Ministers of the Defence of the Block will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru provides the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the South American Union (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were interviewed during World War II" and other conflicts, "but they were now almost a country".
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
"There must be free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive areas that we want to have in the past" he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President was in favour of the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who reject our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he has not betrayed his own principles, but rather has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that its trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticised Swedish justice who demanded that he submit to an interrogation on a alleged sexual offence in his territory, while "Swedish legislation allows it to be done by videoconference, which could have been done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the embassy informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being stuck in a small space without being able to exercise freely.
"This is about the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa reports that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, which would be the award of a non-conductive procedure that would allow it to go to Ecuador, is between the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he stresses that there has been discussions in London in order to find a solution to the closure of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures with various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain agreed to the except conduct in the morning, it would end."
And if Sweden, as it fully permits its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or question him through Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he would not tolerate was "the mediocrit, the evil faith and the lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press are not evil or perverse politicians, but bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed that this was not the kind of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and pursue the right path".
Korea also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should stand firm and not tolerate the opportunism and attempted coup d'état" because, in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers it "perfectly relevant" to the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the Hague International Court, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to advance together.
They need to be solved together to go beyond them and go ahead.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the correct resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders that opposed Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "beneficial that Latin America would seize the international bodies if both countries agreed to accept a judgment so firmly as to be".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to challenge a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Korea has ensured that, if it lost its primary in February 2013, it would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed it was me that guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential mandate and I will then withdraw from political life.
If we ever forgive, I will, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a rejection of President Chávez's health status," he commented.
The Heads of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
The AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test was confirmed: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "the most painful", in vain.
The young man hid it in his family.
He decided to take care of his illness and began to inform himself about it and his opinion was so that he had just celebrated his 43rd anniversary.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmatisms.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided telling him "because he was without a voice."
At the time, having the AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "explosed" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he refers to the fact that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immunization that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reached a rate of 500 CD4.
To speak simply, this means that for someone who will receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years," the researcher explained.
In order to put this progress in its context, we need to know that the Mexican life expectancy is now 76 years on average.
If there has been a significant decline in mortality in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
Nothing that in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there any more deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years, we've never missed drugs, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or then they learn to get to advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine patients on ten arrive while they already have an opportunistic infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on overall mortality, it is to carry out earlier diagnostics and, for this, it is necessary to offer mass testing tests to all persons who are asking for it."
Experts and members of the Council of State for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to test it in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his youth, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffering from the sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Any change when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I blow up three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents know only that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World Day against AIDS.
If they do the test, if they take risks, they'll know sooner if they're seropositive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, says Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist, who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest resident in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, it's very good, but as a result, that today, some still do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do?", asked with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents don't want to hear, ensures the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold to accountants, but that they are found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places where young people attend.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it any more to pay the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best thing is to provide condoms to those already sexually active," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
An estimate of 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in the number of new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contaminants are sexual, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as there are 4 or 5 people who are not aware of each recorded case.
A judgment ratified by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial failure in Mexico. The scenario creates a bad precedent for all national corporations with branching in the neighbouring country and with problems of solvency.
It would therefore appear that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the trial rendered on June 15th by Judge Harlin Hale of the North Texas Branch Court leaves Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of embarking their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the principal glass manufacturer of Mexico to enter the United States Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors must register under the United States Trusts Act, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would be to denounce the cooperation of international proceedings in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-society vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are about half a dozen examples here, including Agrex and Commercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of Commercial Failures which had guaranteed debt.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, in any way the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "empty" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes against 37.
A data omitted by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis facing the United States, which has cost the country.
For the moment, the González Sada family society will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is to say with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The appeal of insurance will require non-property and requires a review of the trial by a higher court, in which case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican Government on behalf of the curiae amicus ("friend of the Court"), detailing Vitro's proceedings under the Trade Trusts Act, stating that it would free him from the conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Trusts Act.
He also noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carabolization of two sides: they absorb Vitro and they absorb the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints from the Mexican Aviation Society's trade unions against the former employer of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, have been brought to silence for several months, and this was accused of fraudulent administration, and the Association of Air Pilots has already encountered problems.
The case, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied providing information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 trust commission from Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicoa de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares from the Professional Office of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're watching Dragon Mart.
Meetings at the end of the week at an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colosal center of sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products in the country of the big wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in bringing together the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the largest of all the threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain under the terms and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Contrafaction Trade Agreement, known as ACTA's English Signage, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it has been well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was considered to be a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting them in the short-term, the real estate promoter Homex launched on the Stock Exchange market for 500 million pesos.
This issue of securities is the first of the four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competitive
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet companies, IT leaders, a new consortium with competitive social reasons has just been born, the goal of which will be the market for clustering software services in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The World Cup winner "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before brain hemorrhage does not condemn him in the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been implicated in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I've carried several helmets in the basketball all my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls at a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his journey out of standard, testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he most loves are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s to 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"That was my best years, the ones I've enjoyed most because I've had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has taken many years of satisfaction, including the five championships fought from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead in the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been in charge here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I've got a hard player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how it started at Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gauss was going to help us try to win another one.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great leader of the federation.
At that time, he would rather take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World, where we arrived 4th and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us the last match, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we brought a raise to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Qujote" Morales, who could not attend the 90th world due to a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Snow, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruiter in replacement of the players suspended by the Imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all prognosis.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, this is about Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as did Piculín.
And that doesn't take his trajectories into account in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Portuguese leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
It was part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season at the beginning of the 1990s.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would like to put in place, such as the regionalization of the categories of minors.
For example, Ponce boys play only in their area and only face teams from the other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch music clips from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my little kids and, from time to time, I watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, which has always been on my side.
actor Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the main role of John Ross Ewing, known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarcerated a man of business without scrupulous, reroutable and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as magnatator of unscrupulous oil J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year to J.R's role in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications of a cancer, according to a family communiqué sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear home town of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved the most," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, reported his attack on the press, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived a deep life," Gray said in a communiqué.
Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and had suffered a heart attack.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman was introduced to television in the role of a regular type in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained little time for the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in the cinema are the roles well received by the critic in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the deliciously hated J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The drama series of the CBS channel on the Ewing clan and their neighbors was released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to entertain the suspension around a full episode of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in betting.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at this time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made Dallas the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s beautiful sister, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfied man but with charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and a unfaithful wife who tried to internalize his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would be like for J.R as a epithelial," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "What about the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, a co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "excellent, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, the chain has been informed.
For the moment, neither the Warner nor the TNT chain have communicated how Hagman's death will be incorporated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who is famous for classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scene of the New York theaters in the early 1950 ’ s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he titled his "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R's impeccable memories)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he said to the press at that time.
After his liver count, he became an active organ donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the troubled patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to work and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it'll be okay."
He has also been a campaigner against tobacco and has participated in several campaigns.
A "End of the World" course just started
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate heating.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistable hammer there: the end of the "great set" of the Maya calendar, on December 21, to which many refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was expected of him during the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax haven that some have nicknamed "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theologians at the end of time thought the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé this week to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we report it, it was a very good time.
And remember that what is evil is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which in theory will be the last one in history.
At the Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vucker gave the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate heating.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vucker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restal and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of History of Art and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, just called "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not disappear," said Professor Restal.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the watch of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students with any choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restal said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restal about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who were asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students questioned, and even less a teacher, told us not to believe in the end date of the 21 December world.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, a last-year student in Temple, aged 21 and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it was only a key date on the calendar, said Restal.
But I agree that there is anxiety related to apocalypse in Western culture, which has risen to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
"In other places around the globe, people don't think about it," he says.
It's mostly the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who gave courses to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that there were courses here on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a superior authority.
We have the Pope's grace.
Restal points out that over the years, many dates have been mentioned, and he states that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date slightly.
Several told us that they were thinking about going to parties "of the end of the world."
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student in communications.
