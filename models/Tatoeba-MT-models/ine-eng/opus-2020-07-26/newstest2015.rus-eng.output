Scientists found a way to find family stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied the turbulence and its impact on chemical uniformity in constellations.
It is expected that the opening of specialists will allow for the search of relatives among the stars, that is, from one cluster.
The results of their studies were published in the journal Nature and can be briefed on the University website.
The result of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulence in the clouds of gas prior to the formation of stars.
Even if the star born then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition may determine its place of birth and region of education of the star family.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of family members in the cluster.
The results of the modelling carried out by astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their research, supercomputer specialists have simulated two inter-star gas streams that formed a cloud together.
This object is transformed into a cluster where protostars begin to form over a few million years of gravity.
Scientists have added herbs to the original gas streams and have found that the rapid turbulence in the cloud results in a high degree of chemical uniformity.
According to astrophysics, their research has shown that chemical-based stars can be sought, as well as the possible regions of education of such objects.
Karata Police arrested 20-year-old after a high-speed motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was confiscated after passing 125 km/h in a speed limit zone of 70 km/h and through Bushland to hide from the police in Pilbara.
The transport police patrol in Carrat tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding that its speed was 125 km/h when he left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued his trip to Bergess Road, and then returned to Bushland, which resulted in the loss of his sight.
The motorcycle and the person described by the driver were seen near the home of Walcott Way in Bulgarre.
The police of Karata accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop and put in danger of driving.
It must be brought before the World Court of Carrat on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
The training year for DND will begin not earlier than October

Lavrov: Russia will not become a "walled door" for new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "flash the door" with new sanctions.
This is said today by the head of MID RF Sergei Lavrov, speaking before IGMO students and teachers.
In view of our response to the new wave of anti-racial sanctions, I will not even debate, fantasize, because everything has to be calculated specifically, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will look like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be related to the cracking of doors, some attempts, falsely understood, - the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, withdraw from our interests, protect our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw the partners' conclusions on their adequacy, treaty capacity and reliability.
Following the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it is very good to judge what partners are seeking - the head of the IMF continued.
If the whole voice says that "they'll also be painful to us, but we're forced to go on to punish Russia," that's probably not very appropriate."
There is no way for the WTO to respond to possible new sanctions.
On the contrary, we want to develop more actively the WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is indicted in the demise and has been using anti-dumping measures against the RF industry.
"We are ready for WTO mechanisms and in order to resist our position on the inadmissibility to apply the third EU energy package's rules retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How is it right to use cheese in design now?
Questions were answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since the siren loses its main attraction after flowering, it is willing to be made out with other artists.
It is beautifully intertwined with many cultures.
With cheese, both plants that are decorative at other times and colourful at the same time can and should be cut.
Another addition to cheese is that it provides a mass of opportunities for creativity.
You can form its stem tree of different heights, improved with art, with wide ground, and even with garden buns, a tree with a wonderfully embossed trunk.
Just choose the form that is more consistent with your design now.
In Carlia for the sale of fake money, the resident of Leningrad
As reported in the Republican IMF, the man was engaged in his criminal business in the Oloneck and the Segeg region.
In addition to Kareli, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting the Volo-year area, where he had been sentenced to two and a half years in prison this spring.
Later, the man was brought before the Dutch District Court.
In order to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in the Segeu.
In the investigation, several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of the current year, criminal case files were sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with the holding of the general regime.
The sentence did not enter into force legally.
Recall that last week, two other counterfeit merchants were convicted, who were paid in petro-industry stores.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also arrived in Carlia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four.
A fine of 500 thousand rubles each.
The sentence has not yet entered into force legally.
In Archangelsk, they celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first “Dervis” convoy.
The meeting, which was held in the district centre, was devoted to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis provided military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
At the Archangel Memorial, the future monument to the northern convoys, which is located on the coast of Sedova in Solombala, was the foundation stone.
The event was attended by representatives of the Veteran organizations of Archangelsk, children of the Cadets class.
For the first time, we gathered twenty-three years ago when a stone was laid.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who haven't returned to the sea," said the chairman of the Board of Veterans of the North Sea Passage Boris Karp.
The event was followed by a city spirit orchestra, and Cadets class instructors gave the veterans flowers and marched with Russian flags and the flag of Victory.
The meeting ended with the flowering of the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal boots, lead, breast and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were on board, including 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrikein miners, in a decommissioned state.
There were 16 WFP vessels in the UK, including two aircraft.
The caravan of ships was not found by the opponent and was well reached at the Arhangelska point of destination.
Of the 848 ships that participated in vital caravan operations, 126 vehicles and about 50 military vessels were killed.

I remember a very American idea that labour rights are human rights.
Congressmen Kit Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill on which trade union organizations are protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions, there and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat, who is co-chaired by Congress of the Progressive Group.
That is why I am proud to represent the Act on the empowerment of workers, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities in the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of trade union opponents.
Amendment of the Labour Relations Act to enable workers who are discriminated against in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damage and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellis, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
It was a time that millions of Americans still remember when that country at the same time protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArtur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military-led autocracy of Hidecka Todzy was replaced by democracy.
With full awareness that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of new Japan, they have included a text that directly recognized that “the right of workers to organization, to negotiations and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in a new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations in order to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements which restrict or attempt to impair this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be considered illegal.
When the former former leader, Eleanor Roosevelt, chaired by the International Commission on Human Rights, made up the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the composers included the guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and enter into trade unions to protect his interests”.
The American generations have taken the basic rule that labour rights are human rights.
When the country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being violated in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that workers should have the right to an organization and that their voices should be heard in a free and open society.
Like a wonderful Martin Luther King Younger said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have created a wonderful market for industry and have raised the whole nation to an unparalleled level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history will remember them.
History remembers how we should.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - has long been a matter of age.
Kit Ellison and John Lewis are reinvigorating ideals that have historically expanded America and made a promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, the federal judge temporarily blocked the entry into force of Louisiana's law, which his supporters say will probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this, which was signed to be carried out by Governor Louisiana Bobby Ginadal in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, abortion physicians would be required to have the authority to accept patients in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such powers.
“The complainants will be allowed to work legally, continuing their powers of action,” wrote Judge John DeGrewells in his decision.
The hearing will be held during the month on which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
The defenders of the right to abortion have welcomed this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it will give doctors more time to get hospital powers.
“Today’s decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from a coercive law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortap, president and head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a request to stop the law from a person of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision was made to doctors from two clinics who did not speak to the complainants in this case and also made a statement of approval.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognized such measures as unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key elements of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in that state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
The fights for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obesaries and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on the powers of adoption impose restrictions on doctors who are not required in terms of medicine.
Anti-abortionists object that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in the closure of the clinic.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has a hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out this procedure, the doctor, fearing their safety, would stop carrying out the procedure, the group reported.
In criticizing this decision, officials in Louisiana said that they would not punish abortion physicians while their statements of authority were pending a decision.
This will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the product in the range of trade networks must be Russian production, and is considered to be a member of the House of Commons of the Russian Federation, Oleg Nelov.
The Parliament has prepared a bill to introduce protective measures against domestic producers, writes the “Report”.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This concerns goods that are not produced in Russia; according to the other product groups produced in Russia, the Riddler will have to provide at least half of his family producers," Nil told the publication.
Along with the amendments to the article “On the basis of State regulation of trade in FP”, the bill provides for a change in the Tax Code, which sets a reduced rate of FPN to 10 per cent in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trading networks is a package of incentives for Russian producers.
A few times more domestic goods will appear on the sidelines.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to a lawyer from Nalovic, an independent expert centre, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food sectors, will have a positive effect and will lead to growth.
In addition, farmers, farmers, small shops will appear.
They can sell more, which means that income will grow.
They will also be entitled to dictate their terms and prices to the riders, since they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenue, create new jobs, some sectors will start to expand, some more rapidly, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food is declining several times, indeed not immediately," the expert notes.
Earlier, Russian companies were often unable to access local stores because of high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo, this nest has been released and it can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all the necessary agreements and health checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be delivered.
In other words, there is now a moment of silence when the former players have already left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, the demand for domestic raw materials was increased, as well as the price of ready-made products was increased," told Aif.ru, the first vice president of the Russia People's Public Organization of Russian Financial Directors' Club, B.C. Tamara Kasianova.
It is clear that the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food in each category will enable the local sector to be consolidated.
In such a case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that are cheap from another State ' s subsidies.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will spread among companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasianova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of their counterparts far from all the articles.
And in this situation, trading networks will have to "draw" the proportion of Russian goods up to half the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that unscrupulous goods will be carried on.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied in Russia," the expert added.
The negative effect of quota introduction is felt by large trading networks, especially those that would benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by such an arrangement, as demand for their production will decline.
Lithuania does not rule out that the quota law on domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The case is that some Russian production products can substitute for the quality of import analogues, while shops will be able to charge prices for the second as a deficit product.
The idea of importing economists again was forgotten in the early 2000s because of the constant devalvation of rubles in February of this year.
In the light of the difficult relations with the West, the question of rejection of imported products is now becoming even more relevant.
The Act is designed to oblige the riders in the formation of orders for suppliers to be considered as domestic producers.
Then we will move much faster and safer on the way to import, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be set up in a shorter time," said Member Oleg Nilov.
In particular, the quota mechanism will be effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the percentage of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover Russian shops.
In addition, powerful impulses can also produce meat production.
It is known that the largest percentage of imports is kept in cattle, from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It turns out 65-70% still belongs to Russian production," Kasianova says.
The experts believe that the introduction of quotas for domestic products is a substitute for import and may accelerate the process.
However, this initiative will not, in itself, replace itself, as a package of measures is needed, as Lithuania is assured.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may still be imported from outside the border, i.e. there will be no full import replacement, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, quotas need to be established, domestic products still need to be produced in the country in order to meet those quotas.
The quotas are only such as to provide such guarantees," says the expert.
Non-temporary diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that egg cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published videos of their deceased mother, who died of egg cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of death than those living in cities.
Researchers analyzed the maps of more than 1,100 Australian women with an egg cancer diagnosis in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after the diagnosis.
The leading researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Studies reported that the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than in those living in urban areas.
SURVEILLANCE: New medicines can slow the cancer of the ovaries and the cancer of the ovaries
The researchers followed a medical course for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovaries cancer, the availability of current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Women older and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovaries than cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mostly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people treated far away from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elise Nev, said she had an aggressive form of ovaries cancer.
The new FAP will open in September in the Kužener region
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktyeblák was started in April of this year and was carried out on a typical project.
The cost of work was over 10 million rubles.
According to the management of public communications and information, the construction of the facility was financed through the Republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the treatment and prevention facility is nearly 230 square metres.
There will be medical assistance for the inhabitants of eight human settlements: the village of Toktybelak and the village of Dementievo, Punčerumal, Tunya, Fomici, Toraybelak, Shinur and Chaškayal.
The new FAP will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its facilities do not meet the health and hygiene requirements.
The new institution will be opened soon.
The dead four-month-old son in a state of emergency will be brought before the court
A resident of Chowya is on a scale that is responsible for the murder of his own child.
Cheboxar has completed a criminal investigation into the 31-year-old population of Novocheboxarska, accused of indiscriminate death.
The follow-up found that 26 July this year the accused, together with the four-month son, had come to celebrate the birthday of the child of his cousin in Cheboxara.
After a long time, she decided to stay in the guest room and put the child to bed.
When the child woke up at night and cried, she put him next to her to bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During sleep, the woman fell upon her son, leaving him to die.
The criminal case, reported by the S.U.S.U.S. Press Office on Chihuahua, has been sent to the court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Do Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of cross-border sanctions, inflation in Russia will be accelerated and will not be reflected in the government's predictions, convinced by the analysis of the "HST Capital".
According to experts, the delayed effects of sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBK Daily writes.
According to the latest forecast, inflation will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and 6.5 per cent in the next year and less in the next year.
However, according to the Kommersent newspaper, this week the MER should make “small but principle” adjustments in macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the department could reduce inflation by 2015, which would eliminate the expected increase in population income.
The forecast was that the food sanctions of the FP would operate year-by-August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation is a shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," the newspaper source said in Minfina.
The economists from the VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the Government's financial and economic bloc for inflation and forecast price increases in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of the food bans will be combined with the possible introduction of the RF tax on sales (NSPs) in 2015, convinced experts.
The inflation peak of 9 per cent will be due in February, after which annual price growth will fall, experts rely on it.
In fact, last week, Rosstat had the first inflation results after the RF introduced "accuracy sanctions".
Aif.ru interviewed the experts and identified their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the FK AForex Analysis Department:
Price increases have already been observed in the main segments of the goods.
More than, when they came to value socially significant products, the Government had to launch a systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and riders are already reporting on a daily basis before regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, initiates price increases.
The growth of the consumer price index continues to be key to the enormous flow of capital, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-segregator, internal conversion due to the export of the population into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on imports of food products from countries that have joined sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the value of the minimum basket of products would not increase by 12 per cent per one quarter.
The ban on imports of food has led to shocks in the internal market and has led to a very logical increase in final value.
As we are not able to fully launch the import substitution mechanism at the current stage, as well as to improve the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to pose a risk of inflation growth.
If we add further fiscal reasons for lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as poor prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razwaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, in zeros it was also above the current level, another case that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation will be 8-8.5% as a result of the year.
Platon Maguta, managing the assets of the Fund of Maguta
An external factor related to sanctions against Russia while effectively inhibited, but if further pressure is to be increased, especially to the financial sector, this may lead to some difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally reflected in the purchases of cash in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, CB RF and the Ministry of Finance are trying to mitigate the smooth weakening of the rubble, both by market and by government regulation.
But the price rises traditionally after summer's silence and perhaps this autumn will be more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia remains at 7.5 per cent, most likely due to the fact that the RF still has financial stocks.
Gardening centres suffer from a reduction in the number of homeowners
This drop, due to the exceptional reduction in the number of housekeepers under 35 years of age, may lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds per year by the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who are taking out their homes spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of the asphalting of courtyards in front of the parking lot and the reduction of sizes now as other factors that pose a threat to the sector, the annual volume of which is estimated to be £5 billion.
In the Greater London, where the number of housekeepers fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest level of expenditure on household gardens in the United Kingdom.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting housing and lack of space for now did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief gardener in the RHS, said, "The creation of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can transport plants with themselves when they move."
HTA's report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden century" of retail trade in vegetable products as a result of an increase in the number of housekeepers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has conducted a massive cleanup in the Land Fund
Three of the four heads of the Land Fund were replaced on Friday.
In general, three of the four heads of the Land Fund were replaced on Friday.
The official Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the removal from office of Executive Director Atanas Dokwa.
His place took Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund had been replaced on Friday in silence.
The Deputy Executive Director Tatian Angelov, who had previously been responsible for State aid and SApard's programme, was released, reports BGNES with reference to Trud newspaper.
I did not attend the Board of Governors of the Fund because we were not under the law members, but I was later informed that I had been released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal is not reported on the fund's website.

Turkey calls for an American diplomat to report on espionage
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called for the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat in the country to explain the report on US and British espionage in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Bülent, reported that the US-owned in affairs and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German journal Der Spiegel and The Intercept reported that the documents provided by former analysts of the US National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a priority object of research for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ignored the importance of this message, he said that all leading countries were spying on each other.
The information previously reported that the main intelligence agency in Germany had also made Ankara the object of the investigation was more angry with the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies were united against Alibaba
China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (sects, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine) are creating a company that will compete online with Alibaba.
However, to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which left even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, it would not be easy.
The Union of the Great
The companies plan to invest in a joint venture of 5 billion yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent of which will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent of each of the online companies, says the Wanda Group.
The company is planned to register in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu's search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest network in China, with around 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda's infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fascene-belts, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of cinematography and the theme park in Cindao (a town in eastern China on the shore of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring income at $960 million.
In addition, Wanda is owned by the American film theater network AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest movie theater operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by its newly created rival Alibaba.
According to Dun Cé, which will lead the new company, Wanda's association will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the largest online-to-off platform in the world, notes Dun Cé.
Online-to-offline (O2O) business is a matter of attracting customers on the Internet so that they can come into normal offline stores or buy other traditional services.
The classic example of O2O is the Groupon or Vigoda.ru coupon sales services.
"O2O is the largest "pirog" in online commerce," said leader Wanda Van Zijnlin (quota on Bloomberg).
"Now there is no O2O site in China, and in this situation, there is a chance that everyone will be almost equal," he said.
The Chinese online market is the largest in the world, and it is estimated that McKinsey & Co. will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, Bloomberg reports official statistics: it is more of the world ' s population than India.
And it is estimated that by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million.
The Union of the Richer
Tencent Ma Huatten was China's richest man until recently, but according to the Bloomberg agency's millionaire index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already turned it into $5.5 billion.
The condition of Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is attributed to his share in Alibaba.
The leader Baidu Robin Lee is now taking the third place among the richest people in China, while Van Xianlin from Wanda is the fourth line of the rating.
"It is very interesting to watch this battle: three of the richest people are united in their efforts to raise the challenge even more rich," Bloomberg said the Director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce Research in Hanzhou Cao Lay.
But he believes that the new company will hardly be able to compete with Alibaba as soon as it is established: "Rhim cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not just a competition for not only new companies, but also for the world’s Internet Trade leaders, shows an early report on the financial indicators of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba often describes as something average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than two of its American competitors together.
The net income of Alibaba for the period is almost twice the equivalent of the total number of competitors - it has grown almost three times per year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has enormous potential for money generation, much thanks to its mobile applications," Bloomberg commented, an analyst from Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated perspective of Alibaba on the US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of company services in July was 188 million, significantly higher than March (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all transactions in Alibaba in the past quarter have been connected to mobile devices.
Alibaba must call the value of its shares before IPO.
According to the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed in Bloomberg, the company could be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the Alibaba debut at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place on 16 September.
The road show, which preceded this event, starts on 3 September.
Alibaba's exit to the IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE history and will allow companies to attract around $20 billion.
So far, the US stock exchange record has been owned by Visa's payment system, which made its primary stock allocation in 2008 and earned $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food in the trade networks must be Russian production, according to Members of the House.
They have developed a bill on this subject.
These are amendments to article 8 of the FZ “On the basis of public regulation of trade in FP” and the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic produce in stores should be per product type.
However, the paper will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and winter fruits, and therefore a "disposal" will be made to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the RF Tax Code, which sets a 10 per cent reduction rate for NDCs in the implementation of all food products originating in Russia, reports the Report.
On 27 August, the lower House of Parliament introduced a draft law on the introduction of changes in the "Diversity Markets" Act, which proposes to re-establish farm markets in Russia in which small producers will be able to implement their products.
Magalupa Police Chief Indicted for Corruption
The complainants submitted evidence of expulsion from the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia at the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of police in Malawi on the resort island of Malorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in a scandalous center of unscrupulous drinking Magaluffe.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of the corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen with Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to a daily publication by Mallorca Diario, the complainants submitted evidence of harassment by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia at the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca against Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Guardians of the Spanish National Guard on charges of corruption and will be interrogated by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily edition ABC reported that the inadequate owners of night clubs said that protectionism by authorities was seriously affecting their business.
"The thing is no longer about making money, it's about surviving," one of the businessmen told the court.
You can't put our sources of existence at risk.
There's nothing to lose.
Magaluf got into the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British breather passing 24 men at the bar.
The island's authorities have since tried to stop the hooliganism among Magaluf's restless people, leading to a minimum number of scandalous alcoholic barricades.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where a passing incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage bar organizers were jointly fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The Magaluff tourist resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also the scene of numerous accidents in the state of alcoholism associated with foolish entertainment known as "balconing" when people come from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, bringing rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city at night at 9 o'clock, followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short, split-winded streams, including a thunderstorm that started shortly before 8 evenings and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter, the early spring was released last week, the temperature fell again on Monday until a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
Qualifying conditions are expected to be one of the reasons why Virgin Airlines was delayed from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it fell into the zone of the wind wave -- sudden change of speed or wind direction at a short distance -- and it was forced to rise.
Windmills reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flights showed that the plane had to climb during the second landing, and the plane finally landed about 8:40 p.m.
The delay in this trip led to the subsequent delay in several other flights, including the Emirates from Dubai and the Qantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two lions.
The calculation of construction facilities in the RF will take place again
Price formation, construction management and networking issues of the Federal Antitrust Service.
The FAS has established an expert council on the development of competition in the field of construction.
At its meeting, the Head of Management, Construction and Natural Resources, FAS Wadim Soloviev, said that “the calculation of construction facilities today is absolutely impenetrable”.
The normative base makes price formation invisible and can lead to an unjustified cost of construction, considered in FAS.
And they suggest the value of the construction of property facilities at the design stage to be determined on the basis of market prices for constructive solutions instead of today's estimated standards and unit values for technological operations.
These proposals have been put into the road map and are now under consideration in the minster.
“The replacement of traditional estimated documentation in the construction of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained RGB Wadim Soloviev.
It is now estimated that every ball and fork is included, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes the faulty construction companies can bury the tractor's targets in the documentation.
The FAS has agreed to do so.
"The first cost-sharing adjustments for the construction elements are already in place: methods for calculating the cost of constructive solutions, estimates of these indicators, "RGB" told the head of the department of construction and architecture of the Elena Zjukova.
As a pilot chosen road construction area.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the Profi-Invest construction company, Antonio Damyanko said, the estimates have long been outdated, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
"As far as the proposed calculations on constructive elements are concerned, it is difficult in practice, since different technologies are often used in building buildings," he said.
It's not a secret that the storm is developing in a lot of ways because of the command.
According to the president of the NGO ' s 'Expert Community of Professional Hosting', Ekaterina Lesina, today the State is the most affordable customer.
The Director of Engineering at Rosatoma Vladimir Malahov's Capital Construction Centre pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided among companies with access to the contract portfolio and among companies with monopoly and non-competitors.
It considers that the establishment of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is guaranteed as much as possible from any managerial influence.
The expert board was invited to form a host order system so that the same performer would not be entitled to receive more than one contract in excess of 1 billion rubs or several contracts in excess of 1 billion rubs.
This approach is believed to need to be assessed in terms of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zukov explained, in that case the contracting authority would have to be assigned the role of the contractor, which would result in an increase in the number of the contracting authority and in the budget costs for its content.
In this way, the contracting authority will need to have knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the management organizations and their safety.
Often, it will be necessary to identify who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the flow of high-skilled customers due to the lack of interest in obtaining a public order for a partial amount of work and a small amount of contract.
The Chapters of the Expert Advisory Centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Eustashenko, believe that the procurement procedure has now become a business game to the attention of the contractor.
And he gave the example: “participating in filling the application should indicate “specific indicators” without indicating the words “or equivalent”, “should be”, “oh”, “more”, “more”, “less”, “like”, “or”, “type”, “like”, “not below”, “under”, “high”, “maybe”, “maybe”, “before”, “not before”, “not above”, “not allowed” etc.
In this way, customers often abuse their right to impose requirements for the content of an application submitted by the orderly organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ was, in the opinion of Eustashhenkov, that it was necessary to assess further the quality of the application for work through the participant ' s “paperpaper” proposal.
When considering the participant's application, only the contractor's qualifications, but not the quality of the work that has not yet begun, can be really assessed, the expert believes.
Quality of work can only be assessed upon receipt.
The expert board was also invited to transfer the marginal income from the top to the bottom echelon to disappear from the intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the Secretary-General, the silencer of FAS, Andrey Carikovski, believes that this is not worth the effort, since a gender dealer must be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it's going to be like, in a well-known reception, the Arkadia Raine's Atele: "Is there a claim to the pugs?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip again went back to school on Monday after summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines dropped on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was being restored after hostilities.
The start of school activities brought joy and excitement to the inhabitants of southern Israel, but the consequences of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, Pashsh, where the missile was dropped, removed traces of cracks from the walls and children's pits before the students arrived.
"We are a little scared, but we look forward to the future," said Ronit Bart, the resident of Kibutz Saad, and the English-language teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to go back to a moderate life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said the second time she started going back to school "not too weird."
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibutz, located near the Gaza Strip, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement ended last week, thousands of inhabitants of border settlements, such as Saad, did not leave the street or leave their homes, moving to safer areas away from the Gaza Strip in order to escape a rocket and a mine fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, settled near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubting that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderota, a city on the border with Gaza, which was very old for the Palestinian fire.
He advised his children to study diligently and said, "We will do everything we can to provide you with knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an uninterrupted settlement last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to the fighting, but the remaining key issues remained, such as Hamas ' claim to remove the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down his weapons and bring back the bodies of two Israelite soldiers who were killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, including three-quarters of whom were peaceful citizens, died in the war and at least 494 children, as assessed by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel questioned these figures and claimed that at least half of the people killed were warriors; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six peacekeepers were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the war, Hamas and other Gazaese fighters issued 4591 rockets and mines in Israeli cities, mainly in the south.
The Israeli army, at the time, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes were damaged and destroyed in the Gaza Strip, and 250,000 people were estimated to have been sheltered in more than 100 schools, which were transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohamed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gazan schools.
According to popular price criteria, real estate has been shown to be the most winter growth in seven years.
The housing price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August and reported RP data on Monday.
This increase has resulted in a total increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent higher than the double increase in 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Louless reported that Sydney and Melbourne had a two-level market.
RP Data shows that in Sydney housing prices have increased by 16.1 per cent over the past year, while in Melbourne, 11.7 per cent.
The next market power was Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged from five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government expenditures had been reduced, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Louless said that now that spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items displayed for sale over the next few months, which would be a "current trial" for the market.
“In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the housing value will still increase in the next three months,” he said.
How People Live in the Oldest House in Ufha
In the former house of gold industryers and miners Eudokima and his son Ivan Demidova on the streets of the October Revolution 57/1 (the former Great Kazan) 18 accommodation.
The house of the 18th century had not changed much since the construction, unless it was considered to be a virtue.
Foreigners walk here as they walk, and the residents suffer more than they do, than they do, the privilege of living in the oldest Ufim house, whose walls are remembered by Colonel Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is incorrect, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it's got to be a building with no less than 300 years.
An old court, always open door, a violinist.
The doors in the apartment are located close to each other, the walls are smashed, and the streets are visible in the light of the dazzling piece of art.
Looks like everything's on the line.
And the local people say, "You don't think so."
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatian Lukyanov, resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is in storage, but the money is not spent for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still godless, but the foundation's all gone.
Many lodgers are still in the bathroom on the street, and they are in public baths once a week.
How can you be happy in such a situation?
The road goes straight under the windows, not even the pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's giving up the party.
Now it's obvious what's been heard before: there's a flow of cars under the windows.
You see, the windows are always trimming, the windows can't open, but they're used to the noise.
But man is accustomed to all things, both good and evil.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, we live with three sons.
And other families have a much worse condition, and on the second floor, they can hear more than half a meter high.
For Tatyana’s contrast, he invites guests to visit the neighbor of apartment No. 6 of the Old Town.
A pleasantly hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and a heavy smile tells:
We have a single room, 14.5 m2 per four people, and we live with a husband and a daughter with a granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been a second place of residence.
It's very close and little different from the usual family interface: only beautiful, "historical".
But with a regular flow of water: the water supply system is nowhere to be found.
Lumila talks about her apartment in a round and amazing way, like the Italian house in the Roman ruins.
So it's a very old and recent, daily and legendary one:
Water supply was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a corner and a toilet from the former hearth.
We live only once where Demidov and his family lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, yes and why?
Ufya's real estate is said to have no meaning in privatization.
Even if we only get a one-room apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to move away, but the promise did not go on.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) was the whole dynasty: my grandmother with grandpa, my mom with dad, my husband and my daughter with granddaughter.
It's been a while.
For example, healthy crises ran into the kitchen.
Look at the flag walls, they're meters thick!
It's said that the solution was involved in the eggs, so it's been taking so long.
The house is built basically, thank you, Demidov!
Probably, that's why no one has ever killed anyone with a broken roof or their own.
The construction is still slow to death in our eyes: the boards and mud houses rot, the fields fail repeatedly, we pour cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They're saying that there's a secret lasagna under our room and going to the Beloi River, which has made especially the once-in-a-life elders here, so that you can hide from the danger in case.
They were followed.
Humanity Oldestin tells us how some historian came to him, asked him to let him start a digging room.
Then he persuaded them to give up their apartment in exchange for their one - sided ticket on October.
People's history says:
Where are we on Thursday?
And here, there's a little hope that they'll give the apartment more space.
If we agreed to trade, we wouldn't have won anything.
However, the Old Age's family won nothing.
It's the greatest dream of a human being to move them out, and the daughter of a 16-year-old granddaughter has given her a separate room.
That is, for two families, two-bedroom apartment was set up instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
A nice, miniature girl, Olèse Karsakow, from apartment Nos. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There is a large family of 23 m2 in two narrow rooms.
Seven of us, two of us.
See for yourself what the conditions are.
The stork is stripped of pieces, like windows, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms of cross-holes.
The water in the tap is cold.
Going to the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, we can be sure that most of the women were lucky with Lavrentev's wife, apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's a lot of room!
75 square rooms, three people are prescribed.
We live only once in the rooms where Suworov was a legend when he was staying in Ufe, says the head of the Aleksandr Dmitrievic Lavrentiev family.
So high, spacious.
One bad thing is, all around it's shaking, it's breaking down, it's breaking down.
The neighbors must have told us!
Most of the torments we have with our sexes: the wooden boards have been crushed, the earth has literally disappeared from under its feet.
I've put my back in the room; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room, we're walking up and down the stairs, just like we're walking.
The home of a buyer named Eudokima Demidova Alexander Dmitrievich can tell you better any tour guide.
The gold industry is considered to be a native, he speaks of it with admiration.
In fact, the person was uninhabited: the owner of the Kagin and Uzian plant built a house, flowed guns and rounds, held ural mines.
The heirs of the real estate are proud of the old, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the '40s, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then the wooden rooms for the carriages, horseshoes, and caravans were laid around.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but there was something wrong...
The story was repeated in 2014: new housing was again lost.
We, as a team, have collected all the documents, avoided the necessary instances, and we have also learned that moving to the apartment will take place in 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The housekeepers did not accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, like a smile, they put out a paper without a signature and a print: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to housing".
I even felt that our home was not in the city for a long time, because first it was under number 57, then it became 57 A, and now it is 57/1.
It's like he was taken away in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has referred to the leading sector of information and analysis of the Land Resources Management of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The House on the Street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the housing programme.
I cannot answer the actions of the 70s, only I know that there was a plan for all old houses at the time, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of modern authorities - to restore all old houses on the streets of the October Revolution of architectural value - was successful.
The residents are soon to be settled in new apartments.
According to Barabbas, the Dom Demidov will be restored by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice.
There is an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire old Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
The house will acquire a suitable species, corresponding to what was before, three centuries ago.
The house of Demidov will probably become a museum open to all who wish.
In addition, at the Government level, it was decided to make a street in the weekend.
Regrettably, there will be no too much traffic congestion in the city.
Moving people out of the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
On the other hand, they will hardly be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same place as they are today.
It's just from the second time.
Forest fires started in Primoria due to the threat
The drought caused a forest fire in the territory of Ohotnichi region in the Fire Region of the Baltic Sea.
At the site of the fire, there is an increase in the grouping of forces and funds.
According to the Chief Air Force, the conditions set up at the site of the fire require the involvement of the aviation force.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Air Force Commander:
A fire that occurred in a difficult location has been detected by an observer on board an An-2 patrol aircraft at 3 hectares.
They burn the wood remains on the old burner.
The strong slope of the territory and the steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable fire-fighting sites, poses significant difficulties in the tightness.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the forces at the air base by Mi-2 and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After detection of the fire at the site of the fire, four fire-fighting parachutes were quickly fired.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and to prepare the space for the delivery of additional forces and means of fire.
In the area of lunch in the village of Ochotnichi, there are additional 3 firefighters.
As soon as the helicopter is ready to be installed in the fire area, the specialists will be transferred to the shower site, reports the Primordial Administration site.
Lenny Henry: My father never fooled me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born in the family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dadli in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry repeats the comedy, “Red Rudy” which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio broadcasts.
Soundtrack is a mixture of rags and tails, and the melody is a life-saver.
However, Henry had to deal with some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother died, there was a lot of treatment, and Henry often thought about his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice say, "Stop the noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move!
I want to see the cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an unimaginable guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a Lithuanian master's degree in Dadly and, although conditions were better than his father's, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, smokeless, deep labyrinths beneath, with the flames of fire and smoke and the dog's horn.
My father walked into the bathroom and was just lying there, and you heard him sing about himself slowly because he wanted to get rid of the Lithuanian master.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn us food, and I came to appreciate him more.
However, Henry left his childhood of parental love.
My father never fooled, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got bad at the very end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he had not had in his childhood.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don Frank.
Why shouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with France, where he was married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I have a date with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the ones who killed her.
So when I was very, very well corrected and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious exercise with fitness, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's boring.
No one's a carrot.
The change in Henry's career trajectory may be reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
From the time he received the acknowledgement of critics for his Hotel, he was fully involved in the theatre.
She followed the "Comedy Mistakes" and then the "Labors" of August Wilson.
This work differs from the nets and comets that were an inalienable attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
Didjei noticed how he was born on the stage, and wrote about him in the "New People".
His career on TV began in the middle of the seventies: "For a long time I was the only black paradox/comy on TV."
He learned to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in the audience, I had to learn to be an effective slot machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and that was very difficult.
Lenny in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager had the right to the Black and White Shooting Show, an easy entertainment program in which people "blacked their faces", Henry found out what he had been doing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of wish it never was with me, but I don't regret what I did.
Although it was a strange, worthy position, I worked in large squares and learned to work with a crowd.
But what was "the prize of a light entertainment class on British television for years and years" was also a "gross parade on black people".
By presenting the characters who were also on the black culture in Britain and who were successful, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of show Lenny Henry was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, Chief Garrett Blackock of the comic series "Chef!".
The commercial roles, documentary films, teleseries and roles in the movie took the next ten years of his life, but after his show on BBC in 2008, "Lenny Henry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it doesn't seem like you're wasting your time or rest."
There was also a series of documentary transmissions to Radio 4 entitled "What's good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
You can't tell me to be taught so much at school, and I thought it was, in a lot of ways, a high-class white guy with a cologne and a hood down the front.
So I was really scared of him.
All we did was interview Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, and they said, "You have to try.
Don't worry about it until you know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of those words, and you'll understand why we still love Shakespeare.
Henry read 20 sections of the last monologue, Otello, for the documentary transmission, and he's stuck.
I feel like I can do this.
Somehow my head has been fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, it's a serious matter, study your text, do a little research.
So the replication process was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
It was said they were waiting for disasters, and it didn't happen.
We're about to start the error comedy.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
A technical disorder arose, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to distract the audience.
"The voice inside said to me, "You'll have to work for 10 minutes while they're doing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would be resumed as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something said to me, "Oh, glory to God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else know about it.
"You play play, stay in the role."
Henry's at the "Zaborah" at the Dachess Theatre
It was difficult to study the text for the "Schools".
Panic is useful enough, it strengthens muscle.
They took it well, too, so it was like a sign that said, "That's what you have to do."
He says this, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I love being in the dining room.
In fact, Henry's still thinking of comics is that all the way to our conversation is the sparks of his humor when he starts, he ends up paradoxing.
I just decided not to work on the stand 'cause this thing with a instant payout from the whole stranger's room, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do this all the time, it could lead to a stupid thing.
Sometimes I work in the direct air in Apollo when I want, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to.
I'm asking if he's going to take the stand one more time.
It's a pleasure to sit in a room with a director who helps to give the shape of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I'll ever want to give up on it.
So that's his new engagement?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place for it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began biometric registration of all government officials in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the Government ' s payment statement.
Staff not registered for the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the Government statement states.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive wages after leaving the public service.
President Uhru Kenyata promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit carried out earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost from the payment of “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that wages continue to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyam Cebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants must appear within the identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data are collected through a biometric registration procedure, the Government statement states.
Anyone who fails to do so without due cause will be expelled from the payment statement, it shall be reported.
“This procedure significantly improves the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear a payment statement at both levels of government, thus ending the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Wiegur, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Structure of Government.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the “contract” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “provoting against the Government”, local information agencies reported.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in the corruption detection activities that had been directed at the verification of government officials, including four government ministers, in December.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and hearing the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time he was Prime Minister) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others under the authority of the Islamic clergy of Fatholha Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after summer canals.
This day is traditionally a big occasion for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsien Yacenuk took his daughter to school.
There he told reporters expected that not all schools had been reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
Not every school attended the ceremony on September 1st.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge single Ukrainian people's front, must fight for the peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastuhov, director of the school in Slavyanska, where the daughter of Yacenuka spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
On the first day of school, children are traditionally told that they wear high - quality clothing, hold their wings in their hands, and give their teachers flowers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader as she needs.
It is followed by a wave of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal affairs of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership.
Its career began in the consulting firm on global management of Bain and Co and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world media in Pearsons.
She was the Head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when Pearson's head of staff hired a lower-ranking male colleague.
Her salary is said to be close to £1 million.
Its political rating is also valid.
It was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, a former head of BP when he tried to bring private sector experts to Whitehall: she became a consultant to the Cabinet of Ministers.
Her husband is former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the president of the poisoned glass.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two objectives: within the BBC itself, as the top level of the management hierarchy, but also outside, as a voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
This is a nearly unattainable duopolis that requires full radical reform.
However, which new president would risk coming, breaking up and destroying the institution as difficult as the Chinese dynasty if he had given up his own business in this process.
It's a difficult solution.
That would not be so difficult, many people would be glad to see the BBC decrease in size, after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow down the circle and new technologies raise the challenge of delicate old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of the license pose a special risk to the BBC.
At a modest rate of £145.50 a year, the British acquire a share of the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and each of them stands for 40p per day.
Moreover, it is evident that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 per cent of the population today supports it against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The viewing and use of BBC models have changed: I now receive news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missing iPlayer programs.
But it remains a very popular and exciting institution.
He needs an impressive president - I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says a humiliating tweet was written by someone else
Twitter, from the confirmed account of Governor Tehasa of the Republic of Rick Perry, presented a deplorable picture of the district prosecutor from the Democrats in the centre of criminal prosecution of the abuse of power on Sunday night.
Twitter was later removed, followed by another Perry account in which the record was decommissioned.
It's just that from my account, a tweet was published that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it off," said the later recording.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the requests for comments.
Although the records were loaded from Perry ' s confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually engaged in the publication in this tape.
Earlier on, the tweet contained minor cartoons for the prosecutor of Travis Rosemary Lemberg County, who was found guilty of driving in a state of torment in April 2013.
Perry made a ban on the financing of her department when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of the great jury in Austin this month against Perry, who was a potential candidate for the presidential election in 2016.
The signature in yours says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of consumption, 3 times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I blame Governor Perry for what he tells me about it."
I'm the most drunk democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg authorities did not conduct an investigation involving a large jury against Perry.
They took care of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry didn't admit his guilt and called himself a political prisoner.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor, who had performed his duties longer than anyone in the history of Texas, would be contrary to the Constitution.
Perry has stopped funding for $7.5 million from state resources to the State Control Division, which is based in Travis County, and is pursuing corruption in the public sector of Texas, when Lemberg refused to retire.
Veto called for an official complaint from a group of left-wing public authorities.
Perry's confirmed account chain is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
At the fifth party in Iowa during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to the news that he could get out of the game, published a tweet with a photo of himself running near the lake, and said, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal"
One of London's most well-known devices warned that the real estate market in South-East England had "turned" to normal activity.
The house in the capital was the subject of renewed demand and rapidly rising prices, and there was widespread fear that the credit bubble would subjugate the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijgli, founder and president of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since peak 2013," adding that it has provided "a stable working environment".
The London real estate market was successful during the fall, as foreign buyers went to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 per cent last year alone, according to the Land Inventory, significantly increased the average rate of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for the private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “persons tax” before the next May general elections.
The London Real Estate Agency of Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, under which stricter loan conditions had been introduced, would also lead to a decrease in market growth, both in the sale of real estate and in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England showed a fall in the number of approved mortgage loans in June on Monday, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast growth in London real estate by up to 3 per cent in 2015 on the basis of the fact that property price adjustment has already begun to weaken.
The volume of transactions was then 4 compared to the previous year in the most expensive parts of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to the WA Ellis.
However, the demand for a home in the capital has proved very beneficial to Berkeley by raising sales of more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pigley added: "The demand for good design and better location remained the old one and, reflecting this, sales remained for a time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3742 new houses this year by the end of April - almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak 2007.
The annual income for tax payments rose by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pijley reported that the expected revenues of Berkeley would be in line with current market expectations this year.
In the unanimous opinion of the analysts, income is expected for a full year before tax is paid in £450 million.
Berkeley's stock was held at £23.96 a.m. on the London Stock Exchange.
Photographs by Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Cinema Academy.
Photographs by the filmed actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet hacker, which ensures that the “catalogue” has more than 100 stars.
The star star "Golden Games" confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence are here and condemned the hacker for "sudden invasion into private space".
The law enforcement authorities have been consulted and will be prosecuted by anyone who publishes stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photographs originally posted on the website for the exchange of photographs of 4chan were reportedly obtained due to the lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of victims of fractures includes dozens of women's celebrities, including Ryanna, Kim Cardassian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photographs are real, although the Scott Pilgrim star against all of them, Winsted, on Twitter, also condemned the invasion.
"The one who looks at the photos we took with his husband a few years ago, joining the house, I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winsted on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria victor," denied that in the photos she wrote in Twitter: "These so-called photos of me, FALSHIVIKI, people.
Let me stop it in the barn.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the Aryan Grande pop star denied that the photos on which she was supposed to be real were true.
An exclusive passage from the new novel by Howard Jacobsson about the love and the letter "J", which sparked the praise of critics
They were dissolved, the best they could say was that they were gradually dissolved like a box of cardboard that was left under the rain.
Only at times did the woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in society, tense, closed, and perhaps a little upset.
And then she held his hand.
He saw himself angry.
He was rolling like a tag, yeah.
The last victim of this necklace was a little novel he expected more than usual, deliverance from lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was trepidated with a tiny beauty with a bloated hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and rough than Port Royben.
She came to the south with the satellite older herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, and the last one had inherited a house in the ashes, but looked like a paradise valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes flowd, in the bathrooms, and the spiders left their trails in all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was filled with storks like giant hips.
It was like a cot from a children's book, at the same time scary and charming, with a full secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the Long List of the Bucharest Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen sat behind their hands, in broken grass among the tall grass, enjoying a sudden hot spring day; they both had a dissatisfying connection to the cheap console that provided the country with dying music and soothing news, when he remembered the old song of a long-lost black performer who loved to listen to his father, leaving the chairs in the house.
You've got too many legs.
Because of their aggression, such songs on the consoles were no longer played.
They were not prohibited - nothing was actually forbidden - just no longer played.
They were helped to become archaic, just like the word "archaic".
The public taste did what it would never have been possible to obtain by orders and regulations, and just as the people among the books chose the memorizing of rich people who grew up in poverty, the culinary books, and the love novels, they chose the ballads from all over the music.
As it turned out, Kevern began to play on the imaginary piano and with a rough comical voice to raise Eileen's big legs.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he said to her, putting two fingers in her pockets.
So his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she got rid of his mouth.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played in it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J," forget to apply two fingers to your mouth, and it'll be a pen.
It wasn't very fun at the time, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew they were waiting for him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Neither did Jazz play, even though he was not allowed to play.
The improvisation has gone out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
It's the same thing with the gear.
His unpredictability had an effect on people’s nerves.
And jazz was a musical instrument.
Although he was 10 years old, he never heard of Sammy Davis Young, Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But even if he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Considering her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The community was obedient, and that meant that each of its segments had agreed with gratitude, thanks to those who had preserved the fate, with the principle of group preference.
People of the Afro-Caribbean origins on temperature and physical characteristics were well-approached in the field of entertainment and sport - and they sang and ran.
Exiters from Indonesia, as if they were talented in everything about electronics, were taken to ensure that no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was devoted to Santec work; what was left of the Greek was tarela.
Exiters from the Gulf of Persia and Leviathan, whose grandfathers did not begin to leave the country hastily, when TO, WHAT THE PROCEED, IF THE GENERAL PROCEEDINGS had taken place, in fear of being accused of burning the flames, in fear, in fact saying that the flame would swallow them next, opened the restaurants with wells and kalians, did not stand out and did not run away from the work.
Everyone's capable.
Since she had heard only the ballads before, Eileen found it hard to understand how insulting words that she had just heard could be put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're really not insulting," said Kevin.
Or maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden that was set up gave him a security illusion.
No word could penetrate through the sound of giant leaf - like leaves.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he didn't want to touch her again with two fingers.
She thought it was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She raised her head unfaithfully, closed up Keverna's review.
There was nothing in the world but the dust of her black hair.
Nothing I'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining in her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you eat it.
It was said that she was really upset.
Do I have too many legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The drawers, perhaps, can be heard...
And you're saying you hate me because my boots are too fat?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you've got thicker drawers," he tried to say instead.
I'm such a fool.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to silence him often led to an awkward situation because, like his father, he lacked the calming promise that could alleviate the harshness of the beatings.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, like, Kevern, wanted it.
In spite of the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons adorned and stood up from a séslon, twisted the console and poured out the wine they were drinking.
Wine from his pockets, so the drink could not serve as an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in the hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
Even if you don't like it.
He felt sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of her speech, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him her resistance.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that in the main lines she was like this.
The same huge ice ocean hit both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and capricious after THAT, than their ancestors, smugglers, and destroyers, were ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to refuse or insult them.
A stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid doll if she wasn't careful!
The first kiss - the kiss is now the most common expression of erotic annoyance between men and women; the opposite of the fresh ballads that issued the console - first kiss her and then hit her.
A little bit more specific, according to Kevern, because kissing yourself was already a hooligan.
Eileen Solomons showed by the corpus that he had to leave.
He got up out of the lounge like an old man.
She felt the lead weight herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him go away, and from the top of the window, she saw him go away, her satellite was a man who had to struggle.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and for men at all, even though some of them had raised their hand.
The man who turned away from her, with his back, bent, wounded, left him in the full capacity to fight. Why did she think that she knew so well if she could not remember any of the events until today when she saw it?
Again, an Eileen Solomons looked at his feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or around the Esme Nusbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ofnau, an informal community control service, prepared a small report on the preservation of low and medium levels of violence in the same parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced if it did not cease, taking into account the resources and forces allocated to its eradication.
“A lot has been done, and much is done,” she wrote, “to alleviate the fierce aggression of people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these spouts and narrow settlements where, despite the rains of the church caves, the gentle breathing of human kindness has rarely been felt throughout history.
However, some of the qualities appear to be inescapable.
The higher the level, the lower the passions it produces.
The population has flown tears over sentimental ballads, stories of overcoming obstacles, and reports of their lack of faith in the good of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness remains strong enough in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there are also data that new and evil ravages are born in homes, in workplaces, in roads and even in playgrounds.
"You have a boring habit of writing too much," said her scientist, reading the entire report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nusbaum lost her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," said Esme Nusbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Again, silence.
"I ask," Luther Rabinovic finally said, "not because I oppose atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any preconceived ideas here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitive, absolutely acceptable and commendable on their own, can sometimes distort the results, such as what you showed me.
It is obvious that you yourself are convinced of the church, and what you call "bad" and "bad", others would interpret as an expression of natural love and energy.
To continue to worry about what has gone wrong, if it has gone wrong, as if it had happened yesterday if it had happened, means to leave the country that it needed life.
Esme Nusbaum looked at the sides while Rabinovic spoke.
His head was pink, like a flamingo, and the LEDs repeated the advice that Ofnau had given to the country in the last four centuries or more.
Smile at your neighbor, your wife's prices, listen to the ballads, go to the music, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A word of silence is better, a word of song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better to love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," said Esme Nusbaum quietly, when she was satisfied that her scientist had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been treated as effectively as we are convinced.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that originally led to the TOM that has gone, if it has gone wrong.
Only this time will we throw out our anger and lack of confidence in others.
Luther Rabinovic joined his fingertips in the pyramid.
This gesture must have meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" actions that have done or have not done our grandfathers.
You go too far, and when you say that they've thrown their anger and "infidelity" to others.
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, having understood the past, that is protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"For which, if you're honest with yourself," he dared to insert Esme, "we can't justify ourselves a part of society.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, it was done.
Then it was.
There's nothing more to say - here we agree.
And as no one should blame, no one should be justified, if it were appropriate or if anything could be corrected.
But why did it happen if it wasn't for you to study?
The last is for us to forget him.
If I could add to that one word,
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovic is broken.
"I'll look into your record," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went to the sidewalk, as described by the passing, "in an angry rage."
There's a coincidence.
The Lesotho Army claims that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of Lesotho's army rejected the conversion process with a view to overthrowing the Government, stating that they were acting against the police, who were suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army had surrounded his official residence and had seized government buildings in Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming that he had received a threat to his life.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's army said that there was no actual reversal, but that the army responded to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces has taken action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police that really plan to arm some political, young fanatics who were prepared to create chaos," he told the Voice of America.
A representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monjela, said that the army's actions looked like a turning point.
"No one has filed a claim to take over the power, according to all the information, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces have at present the main signs of conversion," he said.
The men of Lesotho reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mottjoa Metsing is administered by the Government in the absence of Tabana.
The Taliban stated that it believed that it was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June when Tabané suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his joint Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government, despite the charges in return.

In the past season, he had been in the London Club field only three times.
Let's remember that Milan used to hire the Liverpool attacker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest rate in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest rate in 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The last value of the euro area production sector index (PMI) fell on Markit until the 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were held, and enterprises were affected by the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The European Central Bank (ECB) meeting took place on Thursday.
The markets will expect a clear plan from the bank to deal with the cessation of the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
There is a assumption that the ECB leader Mario Dragi can give additional signals later this week, considering the euro area's quantitative mitigation scheme, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the braking effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Robert Dobson, senior economist Markit.
Germany's manufacturing sector PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 11 months of the 51.4 mark.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economy of the block, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to raise the current concern as well as the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
Recognising that the impulse to increase emissions in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, does not add any confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The fall in industry is likely to be further reduced by an analysis of the cost of additional monetary or budgetary incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where SMEs grew to 57.3, at their highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "It's nicer to say that August's study of the Eurozone's business activity index shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the present time, as the current increasing geopolitical tension - especially that of Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and probably causes some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially major orders.
He said that "more and more like," that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some variety of quantitative mitigation, "we suspect that it will be limited."
The people of Mariupola are showing a live chain against the police
In Mariúpolis before last week, everything was quiet - no one had to organize the Mariúpolis People’s Republic, the city lived and worked on the Asian Sea.
Now people are looking forward to the arrival of "policemen."
According to politicians, separatists are breaking into Mariúpolis to go to the Azov Sea, recently taken into the city of Novozazovsk, which has not previously been included in the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariúpolisians decided that the Ukrainian army would protect them, although it had little force against the well-armed representatives of the DNR-LNA, and had gathered to assist the military.
They're tearing down the mines, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people came to the eastern border of the city and stood there in a live chain, singing the hymns of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same when they get in.
Volunteers collect and drive equipment and products, collect medicines, publish the newspaper.
In the city, shops are closed down, banks and ATMs are stopped.
Ten years of the fire of hell for the survivors of Beslan: ten years from the time of the bitter capture of the school, like the children who have lived in it, are still suffering.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostages by Chechen fighters at the Beslan school in southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were killed during this three-day trial that shook the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death at the church.
Just ten years later, after the terrible capture of the Belan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroicly survivors of the disaster warned yesterday evening about the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, this seemed to be a kind of extreme possible evil.
The tragedy brought together the east and the west in the retreat, which then miraculously increased in action and hope for the future in the most difficult condition.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated on death at the church.
We have found wonderful young people who have endured adversity, although memories of the terrorist age will live with them forever.
The greatest hope they have?
That the war that now threatens Ukraine, in which the same children as they are, will end now.
A girl who's trying to get back to the shooting hall
It was printed in a picture by a well-known Russian photographer Dmitria Belakov, when a white woman tried to take her back to the shooting hall after the mine exploded.
In the despair of Aida, she desperately wanted her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
They were afraid they were killed, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run behind all the forces, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier improved her and took her to a safe place.
After surgery, she thought she had completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "The pain has returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
Several cuts remained in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to this sports hall to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
It's too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my roommate, was killed there by Dzer Hapoeva.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says that the memory stays with her, even though the memories are a little dusty every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our misfortunes, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet, where I go to the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen anymore.
The boy who ran across the city with a bullet, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians started school at age 7) and survived three days of capture, covering their mother Tamara.
Then he had seven, and he said, "My mother told me to treat her if she had an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him to run.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran away and saw a crying little boy on the road, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran across the city with a bullet.
His father, Vladimir, who caught his son outside, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was free and was in a hospital with leg injuries, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran into me and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now out of existence News of the World), where he was rewarded as Child Protection Officer of the Bernardo's Fund, Prime Minister Tony Blair, and his wife Sheri.
"That horror is coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that I remember him squeezing.
I remember putting out all my toys right after that.
But now I can play computer games with a gun, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard with that I didn't choose.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy shop, where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted, and to travel in a car with an open top.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine where wars lead to a fire that he and his friends have survived.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who are suffering from these horrors," said Damir, who was doing volunteer work last week in a women's monastery.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve with the police sometime, and I hope they'll count me in the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the yellow silence immediately after the capture, there were just no children who would scream and run around, and that silence continued for months.
She'll remember her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized that people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings and support them.
She was grateful "Sherry Blair and her fund for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember how when Damir wanted to eat the beard, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the officers at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And the whole month went after our nightmare then.
I was amazed that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world has gotten any better in these 10 years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people the war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy.
I just know that these people feel terrible.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up to be a very soft and calm boy, not aggressive or bad.
He's not looking for places, for example, he's not surrounded by this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it. I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that I've been so sure for a few hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw hell as parts of the body were lying all over me.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run away," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and fled.
This life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgie Ilyn, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after capture has become a determining factor for the tragedy in Beslane
Peace: survived Beslan Georgie Ilin with his mother Fatima after her arrest in 2004 and the Georgia case today
His wounded face was a mark of fear when he was saved from death when Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, aged 54, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son to the university.
"I left in two minutes before the terrorists ran into the court, so my little boy stayed one for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not exactly one, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia was able to survive.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
Not one day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of those days in front of me all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
In the soul: the photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was eternal in sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie so wanted to go to school on the day she said she wanted to embrace the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And even now there's a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and she's hidden in the bookcase at home.
I understand, but I also think that because of this photograph, people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgia now says, "It's important that it never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this breach of Boing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to be something very bad.
"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, because it happens?
Ten years, nothing for that pain.
We need ten years to forget her a little bit.
She affected my health, and I still feel her.
I've had nightmares about three or four years, but now it's better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I continue to go to this sports hall before 1 September.
I want to remind my old friends of my childhood.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like I'm a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life continues.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'll learn to be a cardiosurgery.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgie Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite what was in the terrorist killer's leg.
Incredibly: Georgie Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist-killer during his arrest, but he managed to survive.
At the time of his arrest, he was photographed in a sports hall next to a bomb at the foot of a terrorist-killer.
Actually, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to study at the FSB intelligence officer, but failed because of the damage caused by his health during his arrest.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are dealing with bad things easily, and I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, it was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgie Farniev today with an open photo on the notebook in the hospital after arrest
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm going okay.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical opinions, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second involvement was animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I studied there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals "from basket to cow".
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experiences.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is coming.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know Georgie won't go.
For him it must be even stronger because he was there, and I didn't.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgia is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He's had several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he'd overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This sad experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were my way.
My son with me, and this is the best gift God could have made me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who have never married again.
It's hard to believe that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart broke out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe in it.
We were one of the friendly countries in the past, how did we get to fight now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and a lot will be killed.
If you could catch all the rebels and throw them out, as far as you can.
Alona Ckaeva, 10 years old
A young man who has been put in a safe place by a skilled fighter
Saved: Alonu Ckaevu is a Russian soldier on the left.
She now has ten (right), and she does not remember a monster crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alona was taken out of a school by a Russian police officer in Beslane.
Terrorists fired her, but they cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, Christine's ten-year-old sister, and Brother Mahara in the school's gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alona's mother and sister died in a deadly battle.
Her father, Ruslan, has been remarried since then, and they have his new wife, Svetlana, a little daughter he called Christina, in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, whom ten now remembers nothing about capture and flourishing in a smart and happy girl, says neighbors.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alona and Mahar are both beautiful children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a beautiful father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is observed.
We can understand why.
Advocate-General Sinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's "Borussion", said that he was looking forward to being able to go back to the German club.
He said that this transfer was a happy career event.
Of course, I am very glad to be playing "Borusia" again, says Bild Kagawa.
I feel very good.
A field of positive emotions and with eager anticipation, when I can go back to the field in the form of "Borusia".
Remember, Kagawa moved to the M.I. in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to join the English club, spending two seasons of all 38 matches in the English championship, killing six ballers and delivering 8 results.
A man indicted on a girl on a pedestrian crossing "Pelican" in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be brought to the trial of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing to Fife.
Gordon Stuart was supposed to beat a girl on the way to Pittenvina in East Newke.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had taken his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and had killed the girl, which resulted in trauma.
Stuart, 78, from Antwerp, denied his guilt at the Dandi Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, appointed the date of the court in January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland are not reflected in the Vladivostok
The Duty Free Airport Free Trade Store of Vladivostok issued a bill prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders.
Do not give them the spirit, the water, and the horse.
The Office of the Shop decided that the President of the United States, Barack Obama, Chancellor of FRG Angela Merkel, President of France, Francis Olland, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan, and several other well-known associates would not be able to play in their store by vodka, horse and spirits.
And she put the appropriate plate on the door.
Obama had previously been banned from appearing in the less accessible form of the Department of Dietary Tables of the Institute, as reported by the Society ' s establishment site.
Whether the American president had dreamed of ever eating at a diet table in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the ban seem to be very hard on themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the agrarians
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian agrarians should adopt new technologies in order to obtain the release of the requested cheese varieties from buyers.
The Council was given a visit to a company called Agrocomplex.
The Government ' s head also advised the restorers to shift their focus to Russian meat, which is of good quality.
The annual food import embargo has been introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The main coach of the Russian assembly Valentin Maslakov was pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, third place is a good outcome, given the lack of targeted training for competitions.
Our sportsmen have made their way to their level, says "All sports" Maslakov.
The third is the confirmation of our high level of command.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we are not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not committed our leaders to participating in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become second to this tournament, but in this season we have a collection renewed.
The French, on the other hand, displayed a military team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they had repeatedly publicly declared.
But even such a composition of rivals could not stand against the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order below the same Brilliant League.
The season is over.
Of course, sportsmen are no longer so important as in the competitions at the command level.
The main place here was the place.
And according to the results, there was an absurdity when men were so involved in the tactical escapes at 1500 metres, that they showed the result below the average... of women's strikes.
4 Tips on improving the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or take a video under the water, you have a number of options.
The most affordable option is a waterproof "mill", e.g. Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an echo camera, e.g. GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with several cameras, all at about $350.
No matter what equipment you are using, there are several rules that need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery camera and other rooms are fully closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras have collecting modes or object types that optimize exposure to dark underwater conditions.
And before you get into the water, find out how deep your equipment can get.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
See our customer guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few photos, because many of them won't get.
There's a D.C.D.D. that'll help you compose the photos, when you don't usually have an echo camera.
Even if you have a CCD, it will be difficult to see it under the water, and the composition of the frame will be a random process.
Therefore, do some work.
Also, if your camera has a serial collection system that takes away a few staff with a little different exposure facilities, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly lower than the depth of the water.
If that's possible, stay on the surface when you're shooting in the pool, the river or the ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the less the color you see.
Swallow closer to the collection sites.
It is a great landfilling council, but it is even more important under water because of the dark light conditions.
Especially important if you take the camera: This device is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to approach the collection objects if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 bronze knight of the Olympic Games, Bill Mahov, can go into the Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the chief coach of the Dagestan assembly for the free struggle of Sajid Sajid.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of a sportsman at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently on the team of "classics", says "R-Sport" Sajida Sajidova.
In fact, Bill spoke both ways when he was a young man.
At the 2005 youth world championship, he became the winner of a volleyball tournament and the third prize in the Greek-Rhymes competitions and decided to focus on free fighting.
A long time ago, we had been talking about the new stage of our career, which would take place in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'm going to say more: Mahov can go to the world championship in Tashkent if he wins the match.
But the key word is always for the coach headquarters in the head with Gogi Koguasville.
Andrew Lowson was such a man whose personality could have stood up all around, even in a giant organization such as the National Health Service.
The consultant anesthesiologist devoted his career to the relief of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among those who had referred to him, his wife was a MI-6 officer, who had to live with devastating consequences of torture.
Lowson realized that while the doctor is involved with diagnosis and disease, those who are undergoing treatment mainly worry about something else.
Once in 2007, however, it proved to be to those who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like I used to," he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting with flu-like symptoms, he found that his wife, Juliet, was upset.
"I want everything to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left for business a week, Lauson discovered that he was unusually upset.
Something's wrong.
He asked his colleague to make X-rays.
Just two weeks earlier, he was jumping on the ski slopes in the French Alps.
X-ray results came in.
It was a mesothelioma, untreated cancer that affects the pleuri, or the coating of the light.
For most cancers, it is difficult to identify the exact cause.
Although some smokers suffer from mild cancer, for example, not all of them suffer from mild cancer.
But with mesothelioma the other way.
In almost every case, the reason is contact with asbestos, a volcanic building material that was once called "miracle", but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, in the end, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it: tube-insulators, builders, shipyards and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxins from another era can hardly be seen as a cause for concern today.
But such peace is mistaken.
The United Kingdom is said to be at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people die from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
In the event of an annual death of some 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease as a result of car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we now feel its fatal consequences is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos have ultimately been prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelioma is usually ten years old.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, housed where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to the class, level of supply, profession or age.
Election pools, from modern London universities to private schools, as it turns out, have not been saved.
Parliament's building is crushed by asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us were the reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lowson wasn't old.
He wasn't a piper.
In fact, he had to think about where he could get into contact with the asbestos.
Then he complied.
"It seems that there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the Gaius hospital, where I spent six years in the internment," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors, and truck drivers used these tunnels.
Interestingly, how many of my peers get the same disease?
That was a question for which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Among the four doctors who have been interned in the Hague hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I was left alive alone."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lowson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always mortal.
So now we can just say, "How many of us get sick with the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in Britain, Professor Julian Pito is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most do not now imagine that they will die in this way.

A quick review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far they have spread to mesothelioma.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Jenny Ellen had failed to contact the asbestos company.
She worked on a network of nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing department in two facilities, one of which was the main store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children over 20 years of age.
"As it happened," she said, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't even think it would touch me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance but a group of six minerals.
They have received their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a volcanic structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Christosothil, widely known as white asbestos, is more often found in other buildings today.
It was used in the blood panels, the plate, the thermoisolation of the tubes, the tails, even the brakes of the cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, yet recognized by the Euro Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage”, which may lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crokidolite).
Britain was once the largest importer of Korean asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, even indirect reasons to believe that this is the main cause of a very high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain].”

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a substantial percentage of mesotheliers, when there is no known effect on work or home, were probably caused by environmental asbestos.”
Most of this effect, he said, is due to the "normal use and impact of the weather" on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which was considered by the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the government centre, could be affected unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical shafts and pipelines were contaminated by asbestos, which could cause deadly fibers to move as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament often accuse them of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be true.
Although the Directorate for Technical Services of Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “pure health certificate”, it now recognized that work of £1 billion on the reconstruction of Parliament, improved electricity and removed asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might be sitting at the QE2 conference near the Westminster Greens.
Goddard noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with different rules”.
It is not possible to know if this error of governance will be more vital.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who couldn't identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor of common practice.
Like Andrew Lowson, Ebbott, 50 years old, he suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that successfully filed asbestos claims," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places he worked, and the dates.
He remembers clearly, so it was the day early in December 2009, when he was hit by something that was like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
All of a sudden, I started to get sick.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from a pleural, curve around the light.
But like Janice Ellen, he just didn't have reason to suspect a melodious.
In the end, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Undiagnosed doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract liquids from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition remained beyond diagnosis.
His health improved gradually, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he had taken a sport and had a hard breath.
In 2011, one of the patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
Finally, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection was obvious in that case.
In September 2011, the condition of Abbott deteriorated again, and his doctor advised him to show the results of the CT and X-rays of the team of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was introduced into the space between the cover of his chest and the cover of his leg.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, I'm telling you the truth.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy result came on Sunday between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Grem Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Ebbott suddenly went to a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermoisolation on tubes has been quite often," he says.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now sick of this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now attacking more young people of atypical profession.
The most dangerous insulated tube asbestos in the hospital was in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many of the staff who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (such as Andrew Lowson) or to drink in double tables (as Grem Ebbott often did) are almost likely to be affected by the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved the lives of patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolers set up their Bunzen burners on asbestos grounds
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and Marys because of its amazing isolation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many were likely first exposed to the influence of asbestos in the class.
Throughout the country, for countless lessons in chemistry, schoolchildren set up their Bunzen burners on asbestos grounds.
Web sites have appeared to focus on the issue of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, harmless things, such as mating or coverings of rats, usually contained asbestos.
"This is the industrial poison that is placed in a huge number of our plots," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lauson in the case against the Guy Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was that of a garden sara in the 1970s.
Be careful, then, about gardening.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"To realize this, it's going to take a long time," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the shift from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As an unaccountable number of patients before him, he will remember that he was confused with so much information that he had to accept.
"It was difficult to realize everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because that's how we support life, it's just an act of breathing, it's a cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in a pleural, light envelope.
The asbestos fibers upset the pleural and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is due to the inhaling of yellowish asbestos fibers,” Professor Tom Treger, a heart surgeon who arrived at the Guyana hospital in 2001.
This is the hospital, where, as Andrew Lowson suspected, he was affected by asbestos, now by the irony of fate, the leading mesothelioma treatment center.
He knew Louson and treated some others who were probably affected by being hospitalized.
When the asbestos needles fall into the fabric of the light, Treger says, "by breathing they are pushed into the periphery where the shell is located.
It's, in fact, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes heated disputes.
Some people think it's worth a try.
The trigger's not in agreement.
"It's impossible to cut the apple," he says.
It's impossible to take a knife around her.
In the meantime, this cancer "is not very well treated", which "acts" but does not cure.
"From time to time, there are sick people who live long," says Treger.
But eventually, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live a lot, a lot longer than they expect.
Author Stephen J. Gold died 20 years after a diagnosis was introduced.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he had been diagnosed with mesothelioma, Ebbotta was introduced to Andrew Lowson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single office of support and consultation for the same patients.
"Hello, Central Cancer," he was very happy when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lowson, however, has been "quiet to give everyone a slightly more positive look."
Having met with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lang-Lazduński, professor of chest surgery in the Gai hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need directions, I just called them, and they accepted me," says Graham.
The medium-sized patient would have to be directed and approved for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get better treatment.
However, when such treatment is ultimately ineffective, many sufferers face another financial cause for concern about the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lowson contacted Andrew Morgan of the Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," Morgan said.
But what's changed in the 1960s is what it became clear that even very small numbers could be at risk.
It was then that they spoke of the company's incompetence.
Andrew Lowson and Gay Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-value settlement", according to Morgan, as Louison was unable to prove clearly that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with the asbestos in the Gay Hospital.
After investigating his death, the representative of the Hague hospital confirmed, however, that “the asbestos in the basements mentioned was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lauson.
How to Remove asbestos
In fact, to connect the death to asbestos to one company or to the place of work, usually decades later, has been a major problem for patients with mesothelioma requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed the owner or closed down.
The horror archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against the claims know that they have no time for the claimants.
In response this year, serious new legislation has emerged that facilitates the painful recovery of compensation, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund was established financed by the insurance industry for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but who were not to be tried.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could normally judge for compensation, approximately £120000.
About 300 successful claims under the scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is “good work” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal written by insurers,” he says, assuming that the sum is four that insurers would have to pay if the temporary interval and mesothelioma patients were not involved could be tracked down by companies and applied in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "infinite".
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that a rapid response was required when seven people die each day.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," said Penning at Bill's second reading of mezotelium last December.
By then, Grem Ebbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Lang-Lazduski for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lang-Lazduski recommended surgical intervention, which he considered to be effective in contrast to Tom Treger.
Following this, radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazduski can accommodate 40 per cent of the survivors of the disease in five years.
Abbott felt a sense of power.
"This, of course, is one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Grem Abbott is in operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The subsequent scans did not show any traces of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There was a couple of cancers in my chest.
I just had to be 50.
It's not a life threat.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of the swelling.
However, the process was both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- the finances when I die, for example, or what a woman needs to show how a timer works on a bowler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how to say a lot.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I'm not going to get old.
They reacted very differently.
Themzin is very general and energetic.
She told all her friends, and they called us very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something to be faced with with all the painful cancers.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by a troubled possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it a dark certainty (although ultimately for Steven Jay Guld).
As Andrew Morgan says, "the mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the embalmed Pharaohs are cast into asbestos tissues.
The asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the castrule and increase the temperature.
It's the old one that describes asbestos.
Now there's a canvas that's not burning.
I've seen some of the hats made of it, crawling in the fireplaces on the banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to produce paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Major asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's an ideal heater for steam engines and the turbine of the Industrial Revolution.
The world's production of asbestos is growing by more than 30,000 tons a year.
Prudential statistics identify premature deaths among those who work with asbestos and are therefore denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rockdale.
Dr. William Cook points out that the particles of asbestos in her lightweight “are, without a doubt, the main cause of death.”
This is the first case of this type.
The employees of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
No compensation is paid.
During the Second World War, there has been an intensive development of shipping, one of the most deadly occupations in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by asbestos contact in the United Kingdom.
The world's production of asbestos is rising to over 4213000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in the United Kingdom requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
Imports and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
An act on mesothelioma was adopted in Britain.
The compensation scheme of £350 million was announced.
asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is about 2 million tonnes per year.
China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protesters will pledge revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to put forward candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
This move is likely to lead to long-standing protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilization within a few hours after that statement.
The decision of the All-China People ' s Assembly, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't fool our expectations, but it still angers," said lawmaker Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
It's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
Protecting China's decision, Li Fay, Under-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Assembly, said that allowing the international election of Hong Kong leader would be too "hootic".
Since 1997, when Britain handed over control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to vote on the Government ' s head of government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gave the Hong Kongers the right to direct vote; however, the decision also made it clear that the Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the assistance of the Beijing-controlled nomination commission.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer, when one of the largest and most widely heard protests in Hong Kong had taken place for many years.
Much of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is supported by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to overrun the financial area of Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the statement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central met in the rain in front of the headquarters of the Hong Kong Government.
At the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise to protests in the weeks to come.
However, they have not reported details, evidently trying to avoid problems with public authorities.
In the online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of occupying the central area only as an exceptional measure, which can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very sorry to announce that, to date, all the opportunities for dialogue will be exhausted and the central area will no doubt be seized.
State authorities in Hong Kong prepared for Beijing's statement several days, and security measures were strengthened by police and barricades in the headquarters of the Government on Sunday.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The flow of maternal residents increases competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticise the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations pose a risk to the business - a source of living force in Hong Kong.
“But what they are talking about can cause great economic damage, depending on how many people will be involved and how long they will be”, said Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want the issue of Hong Kong being out of control.
This is an idea that is harmful to investment.
Chinese public media have also reported in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown to be divergent by the Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law that attracted 780,000 participants - more than one fifth of Hong Kong ' s voters.
In July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest demonstrations in the history of the region.
U.S. graduation culture comes into university life: First-class students were invited to come on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to such a request by launching the first luxury travel service in Britain for the present students.
In order to leave a bright impression of coming to university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service had considered security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to take their stuff all over the country into a dangerous overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year to get to university with minimum effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company reported that, since the service had just started, the orders had not yet been made, but added that "the students will start to order this service within the next few weeks".
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay £9,000 per year for training, it hoped to find a market for this service.
Students today are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hope: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and the VIF is what it needs.
However, the National Student Union criticised this service as being deprived of reality.
Megan Dann, Vice-President of the NSC for Higher Education, said: "The project seems to be incredibly out of touch with the lives of most students.
Many students who will start school at the university this month face a life-value crisis when available financial support in the form of loans and grants does not meet the rapidly growing cost of basic needs before they can start thinking about spending thousands of pounds on something of a simple income in the community.
Feminists raise the issue of racial belonging and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands and say, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they're waiting in front of the funerals.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to the murder of Michael Brown's unarmed teenager, blogger Miriam Zoila Peres noticed an Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above racial affiliation when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Middle West increased and national attention was drawn, Pérez saw the responses of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on racial affiliation.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal essays with headlines such as "Fergusone's thoughts from the face of white women" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant move.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we've faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so related to racial affiliation, they felt that they had to point to it.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio, Mitchell Ferguson discovered the problems that black Americans face every day but that are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural field.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and finding 150 girls everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colorful people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe to talk to women about relations, but not about public security?" she asks.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these problems; they face a difficult reality every day.
While white women are now combining racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hetter, professor of female and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"There were at least 10,000 black men between 1865 and 1890, and on this basis the rape of white women was almost always used," Hetter said.
There was a need for a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
In Hetter's view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for election law would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later," Hetter said.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear picture of why color women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women obtained the voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of lynching.
The group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
Mitchell's reaction to the problems raised by white feminists in Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "suffer" the problems faced by black women in several generations.
"Really, would it be great if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology had the right to raise a child as they do to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second wave feminists, who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what that means.
A famous white feminist movement activist, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, took advantage of Facebook and published a brief article by the Guardian Rebecca Carroll columnist, who demanded that white Americans participate more in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger posed by the body - and the view of racial issues that are fundamentally different from those of the public - will be in the head of change," Stein wrote.
Although Stanim is concerned about more cross-referencing feminism, which includes both racial issues and gender, her comments on race in America are still surprising by some.
A researcher at the American Business Institute, Kristina Sommers, author of "Who stole feminism?" said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially colourful young people, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters", but the remarks by Stan on Ferguson, contradict the criticism she had earlier expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "Watch out for my brother", to help vulnerable black and Spanish youths, she followed an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The relationship between the black community and the police is not the only problem that leads to a better line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 minors without escorting to the South-West border this year, immigration reform has again surfaced, this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to address this issue as an important issue for women, it had to be shared only with the stories of immigrant women.
"They talk about themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of the labour visas are issued to [immigrant men], women who come with them are placed in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are a response from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswig House with Pigs for sale
The photo of the house on sale in Saffol was taken away by real estate agents when it appeared that there was a large pig sitting in the guest room.
The one-bedroom house is located on a private road in Ipsviče, for sale of £120000.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the guest house, on which a pig with a head lying on the couch was depicted.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photograph is a pet homeowner.
"However, the photo was mis-located and has already been removed," the representative of the company reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of the congregations as "one single house with one bedroom".
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still in advertising.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks where some asked whether pigs were sold together with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the 4th round of the US Open, who was elected by Caroline Voznitzki, believes she is not in a position to be stable.
According to the sportsman, she wants to finish the year and try to go to a new level, she transfers from New York to Vasili OSIPOW.
How do you generally rate your performance at the "More Helm" tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad you won the Rolan Garros.
With regard to the three other tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
She couldn't even get to the quarter.
What challenges do you set before the end of the season?
I have a strong motivation to move on to a new level after the defeat.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian tournament is beginning in a couple of weeks.
A member of the Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former peace champion Nikolai Balouev, proposed that the GTO be awarded bonuses at the entrance of the neck.
According to him, the rules would generally be the same as in the Soviet era, and people would be given the rules on suspension, escape and other exercises.
Remember, 12 Russian actors will begin to implement the WTO rule on 1 September.
I also offered to the schoolers who had given the GTO a bonus when they came in, - Valuev noted.
For example, they may be able to add some balls to the EEG.
There are also proposals to provide additional output workers to enterprises that have passed the sports tests.
In Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
A lottery game from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being searched south-west of Perth, where one lucky man takes home nearly $1.1 million from a lottery game on Saturday night.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvi brings gold to the main prize for the second time in five years, the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
A successful winner, however, still needs to make a statement about himself.
The lover of the love Steve Forvard said that the winner caused the victory in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and it's all very excited.
We thought such a win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the main prize last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a game from Kenning Weil became one of the five million in August, following a huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for 20 years and reported that winning has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mineconomy wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, Minéconomy will introduce an integrated clean transport development plan to the Government in Russia, the Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry of Transport, Oleg Pluznikov, on a round table held by the "Administration" at the Moscow Autosalone, 2014.
The plan is made up of a Government mandate, one of the main objectives of which is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September - early October - that the measures proposed are for electric cars and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas fuel vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy is available in the "Administrations") is expected for 2014-2017.
The criteria for assessing electrical and hybrid transport should be developed and how to promote the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
The report to the Government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electricity transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the loan and lease scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of cars, encouraging localization and creating service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is envisaged to amend the legislation to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in parks, motorways, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to make proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of clean transport - in the form of benefits for traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to increase the purchases of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, Minéconomy will list the performance evaluation indicators of the regional authorities, the criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support for clean transport production, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric cars in Russia has not yet been established - around 100 electric cars have been sold throughout the country in 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, the imported duty on electric cars was lifted, and sales were about 500 items, predicted by the Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
However, the five-fold increase does not make the electric motors quite noticeable: 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold in 2013 in Russia, according to the European Business Association.
While in Russia, electric cars only import Mitsubishi Motors.
Renault is preparing for import - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia Nikola Remiz.
Most other electricity producers, however, took a waiting position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric cars also includes Russian producers - ""GAZa", " "", but the release of the poor.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM-Holding, AutoWAZ issued 30 electric cars.
The lack of demand for motor vehicles, the director of AutoWAZa for the engineering of Sergei Amanov, will not be able to...
The development of the Russian electricity market in addition to road cars (the electric cars sold in Russia, on average, two-way analogs with internal combustion engines) hinders the indevelopment of charging infrastructure (the unit), the Director of Autostate, Sergei Celikov, says.
Because of the road and low cost reductions in the electric car in the next 3-4 years, the Russian market will remain a narrow segment, predicted by the editor-in-chief, "Authoriu" Michael Travelanski, Zelikov agrees with it.
On the contrary, car manufacturers say that some models of electric cars are already close to the value of conventionals.
The Russian electricity market has good prospects, mainly to make consumers more confident that the "electricity" is real; this will, in particular, contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Slimme.
Such infrastructure projects are carried out, for example, by the Rossetti Gossetti: several stations are being built in Moscow, and some 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of the pipeline network are also under way with other regions.
According to the director of the Rossetei Department, Vladimir Sofiina, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build supplies throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging different brands.
In addition, Rossetti as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, it is designed to do so with regard to the charging of electric cars.
Pancok considers the most effective measure of the formation in Russia of the electricity market to be the collection of customs duties.
The zero rate will be effective by the end of 2014, with the possibility of extending it, expanding the preferential list.
The replacement of transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and all machines concerned) also supports the market, but it is not as sensitive as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric cars, now account for 12 per cent of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for drivers, such as free parking in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), to be assured by Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric cars to designated stations that are not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
A single engine plane Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, U.S.A.

The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Danube area, the Donbass battalion is being dealt with by prisoners of the Donbass.
The riders were surrounded by the Addis Ababa.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of rifles were shot.
The survivors say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine really was, they wouldn't go to war.
108 prisoners can be called happy.
Carats from the Donbass battalion remained alive after the "measorbuk" in which they fell under the Addisive.
In the area of the army of the People's Republic of Donetsk, the fighters spent a few days actually spent by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that the ring could be pulled out of the hall, the column moved.
But literally in a few minutes from all sides, the bullets and bullets hung.
"The judge told me that we had a corridor, that we were allowed to leave, and that the battalion commander with the so-called "Lermonts" also told us.
And when we went down the bottom between multiple and redhead, a cross-fire started with antitank-controlled missiles, with a "rubbers", grenades of 30 millimeters, BMD automatic rifles, small arms.
Four cars went in front of me and behind three, and the result was only two cars left.
An officer called Laermont tells us that at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many died later.
The survivors are now providing medical assistance to those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that so-called "terrorists" are dealing with them, giving them food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and caused them to die.
They just betrayed us, they say.
A column, the whole battalion, to destroy it.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his companions, Alexei was a volunteer, because in Ukrainian news, they told about the atrocities that were reportedly committed in the south-east of "separatists".
Alexei has already seen a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
My friend called me, told me there was a mini-mimetic shot, which is probably the Ukrainian armed forces, one of the soldiers, Alexei.
Then I wanted to get out of the battalion.
We weren't released from Addisco, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, I've already written the report on departure.
We were immediately taken to Addiske with Zuracho's funerals.
According to the detainees, 300-350 people were locked up in the cat under the Addisive.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be returned, they would not enter the penal battalion for anything.
All the detainees were handed over to the DNR force.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.

The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued his money and rubble and even updated the historical maxim to the dollar.
Now investors are already playing a deterioration in the geopolitical environment and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, it is still more like an artificial hysteria spread through the media, especially the western ones.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the FP are not so much.
TeleTrade “At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the biovoltaic basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the positions of the national currency can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will be tried with "Ideal Tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" filed an "ideal-tour" claim for a total amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
It is two cases to be held in October.
There will be different judges to look at.

Hen Director of Aeroflot, Vitaly Saveliev, calls it even more than two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblog service has changed the user registration process to faster involve new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microbials.
Now, new Twitter users will watch a large number of recommended accounts during registration to form their readings immediately.
The recommendations are based on those identified in the registration of interests.
However, Twitter automatically sets a branch for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually take pictures of the cookies so that he does not read those who are not interested in them.
If the microblog users had seen only the recommended users' avatars, Twitter would now turn off one of the popular tweets from a blogger to help make an impression on the person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter's country registration in the last three years.
Twitter has been active in modernising the service lately.
This activity is primarily linked to the continued efforts of the service to achieve infinity.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a fall in reader activity.
The company is now desperately in need of more reliable consumer resources, which would remain for a long time.
Only in this way can a steady stream of advertising be ensured.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be a day of light and rain
The first September in the Moscow region will be cold and rainy throughout the day, meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow ranges from 16 to 18 degrees, in Podmoskovje - 13 to 18 degrees.
When the cloud clears the weather, the rains will pass, and the wind of the east quarter will be quite weak, only 3-8 meters per second.
Automotive utility programme resumed on 1 September
As of 1 September, a vehicle-utilization programme has been renewed in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade explained, the funds are allocated from the limits that have already been allocated to the Ministry of Industry and Trade by redistribution from other areas of support.
The programme covers all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will amount to between 40,000 for the light car and 350 thousand rubles for the goods.
In Russia, such a vehicle-utilization programme had already been in place.
The main difference in the current project, the Minister explained, is that not only is the use of machines to obtain a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car is over six years old, to purchase a new one with a discount when the old one goes to the dealer, the interface is passed on.
More than 16 billion rubles have been lost in the previous federal waste disposal programme, which took effect from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of light cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million (plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will issue a game of contemporary journalism
Gamemaker Nikki Case, known for the Come Out Simulator game, decided to issue a modern journalism game.
He told me about his project in a Kill Screen interview.
Case started work on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact is that only now has been widely known.
A source of inspiration for the game has become the events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place after a police officer killed an unarmed black girl.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how information on history affects its impact.
The hero of the game, a civil journalist, will need to take a picture of what is happening in areas where police and population clashes occur.
Hero can take a different picture of what's happening, which affects the movement of events.
If he takes the scene in such a way that the police are going to look like heroes and the protesting gangs, the police are going to be better off treating him and letting him go where he can't go.
If he's going to highlight events differently, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a big rebellion.
The eyes of the game will have to be picked up by a hero tweeter, where new subscribers will appear if the photos are popular.
The game has no title yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph was made and processed.
In an interview, Kill Screen Case explained that he had been considering the concept of such a game for a long time, but originally he wanted to dedicate it to not protests in the United States but to developments in the Gaza Strip.
After he began to collect material for the game, the game designer realized that he did not have enough knowledge and skills to highlight the history of the region.
However, when he saw the news of the events in Ferguson, he decided to play the game on the grounds of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who issues browser games.
Its most famous project was the Come Out Simulator, which was released in 2014.
This game, which relates to the events of Casey himself, is about how a bisexual teenager is trying to tell about his homophobic parents.
Geletius has led Ukraine to continue bloodshed
The call to prepare for the ordinary " tens of thousands" of victims of the Ukrainian Defence Minister Valerie Galetei has attracted the people to the continuation of the bloody resistance, says the MID RF.
“In Moscow, of course, attention has been drawn to the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valeria Galeta, who stated that “the completion of an operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of “The Great National War”, which will include “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, which published the post in Facebook on its page, is the subject of a study of non-military specialists," the Russian diplomats reported.
They are eager to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On its page in Facebook, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “For informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that, if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
He also stated that the operation for the liberation of the East of Ukraine had been completed.
Through Hilton removed all the intimate images of the stars and apologized
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been captured by the horrors.
The hackers broke the primitive passwords into iCloud (data store) in smartphones, then their intimate photos appeared on the site of the blogger Perez Hilton.
True, not long ago.
Remember, the star official Jennifer Lawrence has already reported stolen photos from her cell phone and confirmed that all the photos that "shadow" in the Network are real.
Perz Hilton, the creator of a single tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their photos, says The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I wasn't contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to take a photo of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," he wrote a blogger on Twitter.
However, all photos of the stars have already flown through the Network.

Tony Stuart's having an accident back on track.
Tony Stuart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stuart broke into the wall the second time after his right front tyre broke down in 172 circles, ending his speech.
Stuart took his car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said 14 members of the team were upset, but now he's going to focus on the race in the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like it to be a more successful attempt and a better finish for him," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll do better.
Stuart first broke into the wall earlier in the race the night after meeting Kyle Bush, which required repair on the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope to come to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded on the evacuation, and the team was gathered and ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car crashed and killed another driver during the ground track race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either at Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to participate in the Prosecuting.
He returned to work during the investigation of a tragic incident, which resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Younge, who came on the road to express his dissatisfaction with Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
The decision to file an indictment was not taken by Stuart.
The three-time champion was met with loud applause and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting with the 12th position, Stuart walked in the first 10th at the start of the race to the fourth position.
Then at 122 rounds after Bush's restaurant.
The car 18 crashed with the tractor on the way out of the turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, dragging both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but he stayed until 21st.
Betcha and Vitorgan are having cigarettes with Zvanacki in Odessa.
Xenia Sobac and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV operator has not missed to report to his Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprising and very disturbing to the couple’s worshipers.
A photo taken in Zvanitzko.
"On the morning of Michael Michael Zvanitzko Maxim explains what the Instagram is:)) #Odessa," she signed a photo of Xenia Sobac.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no steak, no butter, no other...
The worshipers of the couple decided that Xusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"And cigarettes whose?" "Smoking kills!" "Sometimes it's a cigarette morning") "It would be like tomorrow, but only cigarettes on the table)") """ "Kenya, you're smoking too?" "You were excited about your favorite signatory of her blog.
Remember, it was recently praised for the tasteful meal that Maxim Vitorgan had prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happy is that when you come to the doll, and your husband has prepared a meal for you (first for your wife's life, because it's delicious."The main thing is that now at the end of the meal, he didn't say in the anecdotes, "That's how it was now every day," was praised to his husband, Xenia Sobachcak.
The picture shows that Maxim's making something wrong, and there's already a salt and a hot chicken on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials conducted national protests
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria conducted a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore the former working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Increased wages are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers protested against a new schedule of work, requiring the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison officials met several times with the representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the agreement had not been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations continue, the Head of the Chief Executive of the Administration of the punishments of Rosen Jeljakov reported.
It is expected that the members of the Federation of Professional Unions of the Ministry of the Interior will join in the protest of the union of prisoners.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Prawt (right) appointed Minister of Defence of the Rights of Wongswan (left)
The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced a new cabinet of ministers of the country, where more than one third of the posts were held by generals or retired generals.
Military representatives received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was approved as Prime Minister following the official approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the head of the temporary military government.
The 60-year-old military who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless conversion on 22 May was the only candidate for the prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at the parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed MPs.
According to Prauta Chan-Ocha, the reverse was the only way to maintain stability.
It had been preceded by the continuing half-years of demonstration in which protesters demanded resignation from Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Officially Praut Chan-Ocha will be temporary prime minister, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that military forces are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
Soldiers came to power on 22 May
in the background of the full paralysis of civil authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were arrested temporarily.
Immediately after the military came to power, they were arrested by the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army resigned from the post of Prime Minister Yingluk Chinawat Taksin.
Both of them enjoy the popularity of rural people, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has often made them successful in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the chair elite have entered the anti-government movement, which has practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the media room would be better, I didn't promise you that, an officer from the new Palm browser was leaving.
It must be formally recognized that this is indeed the case, but the mind and the stomach remain unabated.
Because they've always known that we're saying "Belgium" -- meaning the media -- we're saying "media" -- meaning "Belgium."
Restaurants like to state in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and other location.
There's places like this that aren't so good, but even great, but something bad.
In a short time, sitting behind Palm's capital, I remembered that there was once here a coffee "Bordok" (in honour of the same television broadcaster), then "Odesa-mama", and another restaurant "Bojole" and "Friend".
Now here again is beer, but not nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
There was only a peak of iceberg: a bar stand and a couple of chairs, and the rest of the space was not even covered in sunlight.
That's why it's fun here, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, TVs where girls and Russians swim.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of the news, so there's something to compare.
Here are eight types of brewing beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and a number of bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive officer is happy to present the menu, telling us that “media is a large seed”, and it should be noted that service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected for content, but is often very unexpected for performance.
For example, someone is warned that a meat roll with a vallon black (280 rubles) is actually a carpachchi cut to the same size so thin that the parchment paper compared to it is rendered indistinguishable.
It's possible to feel any taste, unless you make a mistake together.
It's worse with salads.
The classic lay (260) would be best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some sleek iceberg, once opened a long time ago, a slender Kenyan façade, decoyed chips from the bacon, plus some seams.
You don't want to meet anyone like that!
The ingredients of the Belgian salad were partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes on the missing quarters of tomatoes or overheated champs, why would the media look as if they had been able to freeze and open them several times for their lives!
I already know that there are perfectly normal white-sea media here!
They are placed in the soybeans for your choice (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
The sousus of a half-life, which was not of white wine, celery and carrots, was not indiscriminate.
There are fruits, and there is no aroma, whether there was wine, or whether there was a mystery.
That's why it's good to be in the middle of the fries with the home mayonnaise.
Curtain watering here is not a snack, so thick that depending on the mood, you can choose the first or second dish before you, but just a pleasant sleek skirt.
It was said that the rabbit was making a local potion in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the other hand, the situation was diametrically counterproductive: the rosemary silenced itself.
It was believed that this rabbit had been fed with only reddish curds, from which meat had acquired such an unusual aroma.
But with the rabbit's leg attached to it, it's not, it's just a scratch in a caramelized leg.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also sweet, with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The cloven sauce turned out to be too much waterproof, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who sat at the table was very informally interested in the afternoon impressions.
So it's time to come again.
The dollar exchange rate rose to over 37 rubles on news of new sanctions against Russia in the West.
It's a new history record.
The dollar was calculated "to-morrow" at 10:29 mcg growth by 26.9 rupees and amounted to 37.02 rupees, the euro course rose by 30 rupees - up to 48.73 rupees, the Moscow Stock Exchange data shows.
The exchange basket grew by 28 copies to the previous closure level and stood at 42.28 rubles.
The dollar reached its peak on 19 February 2009, when it stood at 36.43 rubles and on 3 March 2014, it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that the President of the United States, Barack Obama, and Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, were discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakness of the rib is long-term, in pairs with the euro, and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast meant this note, says the senior analyst "Alpari" Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses either.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today's hearings about the invasion of the troops have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has become very emotional.
All the talks that he had held on to such news were overcast yesterday.
A week, according to expert estimates, will cover about 36,90 and 37,05 dollars.
The tax period has ended, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the issue of gas transit through Ukraine is all one chain.
The inflation rate is also projected: the current prices for autumn will be increased from 5 to 10 per cent.
In the meantime, seasonal crops and fruits will be completed, and some vacuum will occur as long as the networks are shifted towards other suppliers.
"The dollar came to the mark in 37 rubles, passed it and returned, no powerful leak," commented the head of the Open Broker Market Analysis Division, Constantine Bushev.
They will still see if they will introduce the promised sanctions on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
Ruble, according to him, was very weak after the tax season had ended, and then news went to Ukraine, and the CB said last week that it was moving completely to a floating course by the end of the year and refused any currency interventions.
If you look at day-to-day fluctuations, it was nothing different from the previous months, all of which were afraid of the 37 rubles, the analyst continues.
Yes, nothing powerful has happened in the process.
The alarming times for the currency market were recalled when an increased demand for the currency was noted at the end of January, as well as the third March when the CB downloaded the record of the currency.
The UFS IC also sees a positive side of the weakening of the rub.
First of all, it is an increase in the income part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through imports, says UFS chief analyst IC Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services can be traced back to a negative point.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, induce inflationary pressures and, as a result, become the cause of money-laundering, which in turn would slow the country's economy.
With regard to the stock market, the depreciation of the rubles somewhat reflects the decrease in the price of the shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the Index of SMEs fell by 1.67% during the quarter and the Index of RTD lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative rate of index reduction is due to a decrease in rubella over a day of more than 1.5 per cent.
The weakening of the edge is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy the currency.
As the practice shows, emotions are gradually gone, and rubbing is partially or completely restored.
"We think we will soon be able to see the relationship between the dollar and the Russian currency close to 36 rubles per dollar," notes Alexie Koslov.
Genetic disorder is often diagnosed incorrectly
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after a misdiagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she was still living for a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a Sharko-Mari-Tut (SMT) disease, a group of inheritance violations that resulted in nerve damage outside the brain and the spinal cord.
The charity of CMT UK reported that an incorrect diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because it is so little known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are suspected to have SMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, untrustworthy walking and leg-stretching.
Illness or pain may be felt, and the condition is not healed and progresses, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the fall of Friedrich (AF) - a condition that was very bad for her.
Rogers thought she'd be attached to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "Rebenz, I knew I couldn't do what others did.
I fell down every day, and I spent more time on it.
I've never been able to ride a skateboard or a skateboard with other kids, and I've had a lot of fun at school because of how I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations, to free her fingernail dry and to direct her feet, she looked into the medical card when her doctor left the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I dropped my nose, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and tried the most horrible panic as soon as possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair in 18 and I'd die before I was 25, and I'd gradually lose all my abilities in this meantime.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not diminished as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me, and he said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already been in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that represents a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, she found SMT.
"When he explained that it was a SMT, I thought I had a happy ticket," she said.
The blessed organization of SMT informed the United Kingdom of the month of SMT in order to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on business in the Washington area is growing as the economy is restored
The restoration economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The state and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased moderately last year when the recovery of the economy was accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid together $27.6 billion in the state and at the local level in the financial year 2013, at 3.8 per cent higher than the $22.6 billion collected for 2012.
The tax burden on businesses by state and local level increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third half year of growth after the next few years when accounts decreased in 2009 and 2010.
The taxes levied by the state increased faster, 4.3 per cent than the local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by the company providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Policy Group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56 per cent, are taxable on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax income is taxable on firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, has the lowest tax income, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, tax revenue increased by returning to the level of real estate of companies, researchers said that real estate taxes had increased by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when growth was less than 1 per cent.
While much of the income is large, such as California, New York and Texas, the same seems to be happening in the Washington area.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid together $10 billion in real estate taxes at the state and local level last year, at $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the return on real estate has no similar effect on state and local income growth in Maryland, where real estate taxes hardly exceed one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay around half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What is happening in Maryland is that most of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to a non-commercial organization that does not pay real estate taxes," Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre, said.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on, for example, income taxes to pay the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax income from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneur's income also appears to be changing, according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, for $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, mostly in the region.
While trends are geared towards one direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same speed in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was at the same level as the average country, 4.3 per cent, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax income was below the average, equal to 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which was the same corporate rate) was 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high, 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia the taxes below for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate for employers than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina had recently signed a legislative act reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate would fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax income targets next year, this law could lead to an income tax rate for entrepreneurs up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area seems to feel better and thus pays more taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Tax for entrepreneurs paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - the transitional structure on which the majority of small firms are established - in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in income from business taxes across the country are likely to remain this year, with income from government and local income increased by 6.2 per cent for the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be left because the reduction in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Jew
The Jewish World Championship brought together Russia two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this figure, the Russians were given only the main favorite of the competitions - the collective Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day of the year brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who spoke in a category of up to 60 kg.
However, in the same final fight against Baldbaatar Ghanbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the resistance was only one comment received by the Russians.
And this is the second day of the tournament, the most successful for the Russian assembly - three medals were immediately captured on Tuesday.
In men's competitions of up to 66 kg of silver, Michael Pulaev was awarded and the bronze was Kamalu Han-Magomedov.
In the final alone, the Russians won the 2011 and 2013 World Cup to Japan's Massai Abinum.
Han Magomedov, at the fourth final stage of the lost co-founder, won the comfort tournament and became the winner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament, up to 52 kg, also up to the third stage, Natalia Kuzuitina reached the beginning.
In the semifinal, she lost the current peace champion, Milinda Kelmandi, from Kosovo, who was the champion under the flag of the International Federation of Jews and successfully defended the title.
In the defence dispute, Kusuitina won Ma Ianan from China, but after the tournament ended, it was admitted that third place was not exactly what she was looking for.
And once again, the Russian road to gold became Kelmandy, conquering Kusutin earlier in the finals of the European Championship.
On the third day, Musa Moguškov, a scorer of up to 73 kg, played a tournament in the Čelabinski Bronze in a Russian gathering.
In the quarter-end, he became the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skowartz, now a spokesperson for the OAU team.
But then the Russian won two awards and became the winner of the prize.
Moguškov was on the home championship with a holenop trauma that he plans to treat in the near future, so he will take a break in the competitions.
As for ex-Moldovan Square, he and he reached the bronze medal at the tournament.
Interestingly, Ivan Remarenko, a fellow member of the OAU sports nationality, completed the presentation in the bronze category of up to 100 kg.
On the fourth day of CM-2014, the Russians also brought one bronze, which was won by Ivan Nifont in the category of 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the small finale, he won the Frenchman Alan Schmidt with comments from the rival.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were played on the tournament, but the Russians by tradition were limited to one bronze in the male tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kiril Question, with Russia's collection guaranteed this medal: his rival to the comforting final was the co-occupier Kiril Denisov.
However, there was no understanding: the rival Questionnaire was unable to go out on Dads because of the trauma.
The male bronze was won by the owners and on the sixth day of the contests, she was put in a pile of collection by Renat Saidov, who spoke in a category of over 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he won a clear victory over the Brazilian David Moore.
This is how the individual part of the world’s preeminent has ended.
On Sunday, the last day of the tournament in Chelabina, the world champions were playing games in command competitions.
Both Russian collectors - male and female - were one of the main candidates for prizes, but, as in individual competitions, representatives of the fine sex did not get lucky - until the medals they did not reach.
And here are the Russian Jews who won the command silver.
In the decisive opposition, they have given up the main competitions - the Japan team - in a persistent struggle with the 2-3 account.
Assembled Russia said 2-0 after the clean victory of Han Magomedov and volleyball, Denis Yarzev (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier categories of mass with their Japanese opponents, Murat Habatirov (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope.
The scenario was also developed by a bronze match in a women's tournament, where the Russian assembly, led by 2-0, came to Japan - 2-3.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin was present at the team matches in Chelabinska, which, after the tournament ended, greeted the male with the silver.
"The second place is very early, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions," said Putin, whose word is RIA News.
To lose Japanese, Jewish family members, there's nothing ominous about it.
But I'm sure you can win them.
Russia's assembly at the World's Home Championship was much better than a year ago at a similar level held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, there were only three medals in the Russian team, one silver and two bronzes.
Meanwhile, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstian and Mansur Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximists.
Yeah, he wants gold medals.
But let's remember, if a man in the Olympics is in the eight strongest, he's the potential winner of the Olympics.
More like a sport, such as a Jew," said RF Sports Minister Vitalie Mutko, whose speech is the press service of the championship.
Japan was expected to be the best in Chile, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next world championship will be in the summer of next year in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers was not aware of the arrival in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that the 81-year-old actress would recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had had a heart attack at a hospital in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscope, reported sources.
Doctors intend to keep her under the drug and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “hard”.
The response was widespread, including numerous Internet support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All the Kings Can Do
The debut album of the Royal Blood group is a new British year's hope for a rock duet from the clubs as a premiere at the stadium.
Duet Royal Blood has been on the stage all year, but has already been actively nominated for the BBC Music Award, a tour of the Arctic Monkeys, and a tour of the New York concert by Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut single album received 100,000 orders a few months before the release, and the contract for its release is in Major-Lebla Warner Music portfolio.
Given the current weeping situation in the music market, the situation is emerging from a number of backgrounds, because it is not a new Lane Del Ray or a regular sweet-sweet representative of the "New R'n'B" but a duet of British people playing with that level of thunder and intensity, which was the last time in a couple of decades ago.
Overall, the rates on the first album due to all the above circumstances were particularly high and were already fully justified.
The duet had no vision of his name, which he had previously been able to reach, but that the most desperate of the hairy metalists, and the blood of the kings, they thought, was in their homes, too, understood.
This is, of course, first of all, about the heroes of the previous level Led Zeppelin: like a large quarter, Royal Blood aims to stop the blood of the British year, bringing it to new heights.
To make predictions about the company's success so far, please, it's been hurt, but something can be said.
The ten songs recorded in 30 minutes are not as much a demonstration of a phenomenal song as a sure and powerful statement of intentions.
Some of the dignity of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say, the pilot single Out Of The Black is a character that is remembered not by the melodic line but by the drumban party.
The musicians in the jokes say that it's easier to beat than to get drunk.
A powerful Little Monster and a closing piece of better Strangers with Shakespeare's quote in the title is also worth mentioning.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at the party of the heavy year’s lovers, but when they are played in a row, they are merged into more or less a single sex.
And that's not necessarily bad, even on the contrary.
The Royal Blood force is that they don't claim to be the laver of the new Lennon and McCartneys (they're more likely to be in the Motörheads), but they've got a lot of rock duets out of the ghetto of the Indie Clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadiums, in a room that was estimated to be less than a few thousand people, apparently close to it.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass that replaced the guitar in the usual format that was invented at the beginning of the zeros The White Stripes.
On the other hand, it is not only a matter of instruments but also a way of making songs.
Heroes of zeros were very hard on the postmodern paradigma, with enormous dissatisfaction to recognize themselves not only as epigonists but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood is now sounding so powerful and sudden that this effort is successfully draining some of the secondaryity and stamina of the music material.
Well, at the end of the day, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what the Information reported on Friday morning: Online Store - and Video Producer - and a hundred other things - buys a Twitch streaming service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news turned out to be a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago the sale of Twitch video service to Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, aimed to be a common-supply service, a real-time YouTube version.
Instead, he quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their internal play points; "YouTube for real time," says Business Insider.
Interface Twitch.
And let's play, a genre of video players who know how to give (mainly, old) the treatment games, like in the Secret Theatre, are already popular on YouTube.
The case that YouTube is often mentioned when they describe Twitch, therefore the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met with no special interest, a classic example of a leading technology company that buys a potential competitor.
This is a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that, according to the information available, it was ready to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shira: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
The snobbies of me, who say they're better at sports than to watch it, find it hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the jostiques themselves.
One thing is to look through the other's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she walks through the Resident Evil, and the other thing is to look at how a foreign man gets 20 shots in his head at the Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are thought of as one person, so to look at their collection without controlling the angle of vision by itself may be a recipe of the main pain that is worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the fast paces in which the Rogers of our electronic age complete all the games in record time are entertaining.
But if this isn't about the virtuoso game or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel would be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics know about me?
The Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and this is the fourth source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is going to turn to Amazon Instant Video as clearly as YouTube could just swallow the Twitch.
However, Twitch has what any company would be pleased to get: crowds of young men who dream of advertising.
As head Twitch Shir said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future game", and this channel does not give evidence of confidence, even - oh - as an apparent kind of sport.
As a result of the 2004 terrorist attack, more than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed.
Over 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
The remaining hostages - almost all of them now students, with the parents of the deceased, with the head of the town of Angelov, Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the Mature Beslana Committee of Susan Dudiev, who participated in the specialization of the PMS staff - are told by the correspondent of the Society of Elizabeth Antonov, who was working on the special project.
As soon as they returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who had been President's Advisor to the North Caucasus 10 years ago and had talks with terrorists, as well as with the FSB government officer of Russia, Vajeslav Bocharov.
What struck me especially when I was working on this topic is that in Beslan, it was as if there were none of these ten years.
This subject is extremely painful for all who have a relationship with it, and people struggle to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very difficult.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," Antonov said.
A special project has been prepared by a study of holding Rambler & Co, which has been working in companies since spring this year.
The previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and to the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
The CDR launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched a small-range rocket in the Japanese Navy, reports Renhap.
About 10.30 a.m. local time was launched by the province of Chagando, on the North Korean and China border.
It is assumed that the rocket crashed in the Japanese Sea, about 220 km in the spring, declared in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of the Headquarters of South Korea.
Members suggested that the entry into force of the Personal Data Act should be accelerated
If the initiative was successful, Russian data could not be stored on servers abroad since 1 January 2015
The Government introduced a draft law on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the Lower House.
Its sponsors were Mr. Wadim Dengin, Mr. Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgenie Fedorov (“Russian Only”), Mr. Vladimir Parahin (“Russia Justice”) and Mr. Alexander Yushtenko (CPRF).
This change, in the view of the sponsors of the initiative, will contribute to the more expeditious and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the RF to the preservation of personal data and to the confidentiality of correspondence on information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, which is quickly enforced by parliamentarians, obliges the Russians to keep personal data processed online on the territory of the RF.
It also makes mandatory records, systematization, storage, storage, clarification and collection of personal data of citizens of the RF, in databases located in Russia, as well as information on the location of such databases.
In addition, the Act confers upon the Russian Guard the right, on the basis of the court's decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of RF personal data law.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of the "transmitters" - an automated information system "Register of Personal Data Offenders " .
This law was adopted by the Lord Summer.
The authors of the bill made statements by Andrei Lugovov and Wadim Dengin of LDPR and Alexander Yuštenko of CRC.
Dejigin and Yuštenko are also one of the authors of the current Bill on the date of entry into force of the Act.
Anyone who has no RF dates will have to pay for the rent
Commenting on today's draft law of the first chapter of the Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin said that he did not see any problem in passing the date of entry into force of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data.
According to him, companies that would not have their own Russian personal data storage facilities in the territory of the RF by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, for example, "In Rostelekoma", which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provide their servers to the Mail Group, to Western companies that are already providing their servers."
"There are also several independent dates that are ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the FP, I don't see any problems - they will get technological opportunities for accommodation," said Levin.
Draft dispute law
Immediately after the draft law was published, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications feared that, if the draft law was adopted, Russia would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, this is about online aircraft and airlifting services.
According to the association, “the bill derogates from personal data subjects - citizens of the Russian Federation's right to have their own data in an imperative manner by determining that their entry, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC's statement emphasizes that the creation of a user information mechanism for the recording of its personal data would be more effective.
In such a case, you will be able to choose the territory in which these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such "localization" personal data laws in other countries has led to the loss of global services and substantial economic losses.

The police transferred more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
In the Forces of Novorossia, they claim that the Ukrainian Su-27 have been defeated and accused of violating the ceasefire agreement.
At 10 a.m. on 1 September, the police transferred 402 prisoners to Ukraine, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as 35 dead soldiers.
The press representative of the Novorossia Army informed the Interfax.
He added that “by force of WFP in the area of the village of Mereska, a Su-27 aircraft that violated the ceasefire agreement would crash”.
According to the agency ' s interviewer, the Ukrainian party in the artillery of the Lugan airport applied cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press noted that policemen had been able to damage two Ukrainian VVV helicopters at one of the field airports at night, as well as to destroy two bronze carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The victims of the enemy's live force -- up to a hundred people killed and wounded -- 13 people were taken into custody," said the representative of the headquarters.
“Interfax” does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the National Republic of Donbass declared the transfer of the Ukrainian side under the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guard.
At the same time, on the night of the DND army, according to the Army of Novorossia, "the attempt of the enemy in violation of previous agreements to remove heavy technology from the area of the environment has been thwarted."
At that time, the police reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a speedy battle, including six tanks and 198 military personnel.
According to the headquarters, the total enemy's losses in all directions (Donetsok, Lugansk, Mariúpolis) were five tanks that night, eight armed vehicles, more than 120 killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers took place in the vicinity of the militias in the province of Addis ska in the Danube region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "national republics" to expel Ukrainian soldiers from the area.
The DND agreed to do so, provided that the opponent was handed over weapons and ammunition.
The first tens of military personnel began leaving surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense Donbass Semenčenko, 14 more people left the cat on Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenčenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded were "in custody of 137 of 32 divisions of the RF and 9 tanks of the RF Brigade", where they were treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russians and the Russian Minorists rejected the reports of Ukrainian military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will take response to the introduction of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take response measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-racial sanctions, reports the IMF.
The Russian Foreign Office's statement states that the European Council ' s conclusions of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU Member States to overcome the insecurity of their impartial support by the Kyiv authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia participates in the situation in the east of Ukraine on the basis of “absolutely unmistakable allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of the country”, said the department website.
The IMF regrets that, in spite of the interests of its Member States, Eurosovet is affected by countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
Members of the Eurosystem should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as for conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the department stressed.
It is also noted on the agency ' s website that there is no objective assessment of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, as well as the number of victims among the peaceful population is growing.
Let us recall that during the next seven months in the European Union, specific proposals for sanctions against the RF are planned.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with US officials.
It is expected that they will correlate between the measures introduced during the period of action and the degree of severity.
The new sanctions of the European Union can affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the defence, financial and oil industries.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
Since the value of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,100 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, thought of a clever way to reduce costs.
He has developed a system of taking books with seniors, offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
"My mathematical analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I got at the $10 semester and Chick-fil-A oven," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at the College Convention in Georgia.
The required literature at last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1200 per year on textbooks and training, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online shops and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
The book is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often it is much cheaper than their purchase.
Nibo Incorporate, a company with over 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of books has increased twice since 2011.
The industry's studies show that about four books were taken on board in university bookstores during the last spring semester, says Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Shops".
This is an introductory course in the best way to make a good deal.
Buy online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you see in the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteller is worth about $290 per prequantum, but a new copy can be obtained for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the detainee
If you're not against other marks or injuries, supported textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematic Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in a supported form at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassedy, a 25-year-old fourth grade student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents at Amazon.com for a supported copy of the "Strategic Solutions in the Media: Understanding of the Business side of the Advertising Business".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracie, director of the College of Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherste, invite students to clarify their professors whether previous publications can be used.
At times, updates are not relevant for the exercise.
In such cases, the old editions can often be found at very little of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, which belongs to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying supported books.
Prokat
In order to take the textbooks, you have to think, if you're good enough to deal with them, don't forget to return them, and don't want to leave them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the math analysis for a semester of about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that may be imposed on you for marks, accentuation and damage.
If you take the book on your own, remember: If you do not return the book, fines may even exceed the value of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually taken on board by obtaining an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" project on Chegg.com for six months is going to be about $61.
Braci says that students who study literature can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classics can now jump free, while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look.
Joe Golt, 29 years of age, who is going to start a law school in Pepperdin, recommends using the ISBN number to explain book prices, as it guarantees that you are looking for exactly what you need.
Before ordering the internet, Golt says, make sure that the book is in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he had acquired was postponed for four weeks, and at the end of the day he paid the full price in the university bookstore.
Putin stated the full inefficiency of the Far East Development Fund
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, announced at a meeting on the management of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, that the long-east budgetary investment fund, established two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles have remained on the deposit box," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested the acceleration of the list of developing territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the TORs should be introduced to the House in that autumn.
The Federal Assembly noted that until 1 July, the President had not approved the list of developing territories in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also set out key challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport availability in the region, the removal of infrastructure constraints - both in the internal market and for export development.
In addition, there is a need to create prerequisites for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as to form an area of ongoing development that should become competitive with the key business centres of ATR, the President stressed.
It was previously reported that the development area could replace the OECD.
Why the eyes of the galaxies couldn't save the cash collection
"Naturable 3" Sylvester Stalin returned less than $30 million from his $90-million budget to the United States, while "The City of Sins: The woman to whom he is to be killed" returned only $12 million from his $70-million budget.
Cameron Diaz's "Home Video" brought only $14.6 million to the first outputs, while children's films, such as "How to Assign Dragon 2" are also disappointed with a payoff.
A film critic's article by Telegraph Robbie Collina points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be in the wrong quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 "the worst" year in all history in children's films, and called "How to assign a dragon 2" simply "functioning" the continuation of the fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a somewhat older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the same as movies.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each film that went out in the summer with at least 2000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July, for 2013 and this year.
The results that reflect the views of both filmmakers and film critics suggest that the crop of the film this year is similar to that of the previous year ' s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing visual habits and growing popularity of Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on a fast-tracked design film "The Jungle Book" said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think the times are changing."
We must recognize this and not try to push for what was before.
Unlike the current fall in cash collection in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the flow of reproduction service amounted to $1.2 billion, almost double the last year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, Director Steven Spillberg criticised the studios for being too dependable on comics and predicted the "screaming" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his dark predictions were a part of the truth.
As several potential cash hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including "Eri Altrons", "Minionovs" and "Yur Park", other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
The producer "Ludy X" Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of cash collection just "cyclic," Hollywood Reporter said, "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of caucasian and middle Asian food, but Russian suppliers are a terrible dream for restaurants in Europe and Japan.
In general, it is still preferable to replace prohibited imports not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a nicer room than a bad mozarel," says the Italian restaurant's head of protest Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of the cheeses offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italians.
Mozarella and the cheese bourata ended up in the restaurant first, they have a little storage time.
Parmesan stocks must be sufficient for a few months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio is making such an eye, which is clear: shocking memories do not release him so far.
The meat was lying on the carpets just 30 inches [30 cm] from the floor!
There's cats in there!
Chris!
Then I said that for our restaurant we would never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all changed now.
But in the days, I was brought for a fish sample from the Far East.
That's how she turned out!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
Valerie is surprised that many things are common to Italy for the Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang to make the muscles soft.
I've done all this with the local beef.
Then I was asked, "Where did you get that soft meat?
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why don't you guys do that?
In five minutes' walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant Brasserie Most in the kitchen hangs a stop list indicating the missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The chief protest restaurant Brasserie Most and the Bar "Stralk" directed by Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the French oysters have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia, and instead of the French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
On the other hand, the Regis is becoming more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The colour hood is 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why is she so much worth?"
They say, "We have to earn too."
But this suit should not cost 80 rubles!
We're buying the East Sides by weight, but they're 15-20 years old, do you imagine how heavy they are?
The price is that it's superdelicate.
Russian suppliers appear to be one of the main sources of terror for foreign lands.
The standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot maintain stable calibrations and quality.
Many restaurants in the European kitchen don't know what to do with them when the cheese stocks are over.

Penalties menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which essentially call for product sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pigmeat, meat and offal from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, mollusks, milk, yogurt, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups into the country.
Restaurants have started a schedule with suppliers: prices for products have increased, likes from other countries need to be looked for urgently.
This will most strongly affect the expensive restaurants from the French, Italian, Spanish, which were placed directly from the "mother" countries.
The community had to be reinstated before.
For example, in early 2014, the Rosselhozhnadzer banned the import of Australian beef and, a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
Suppliers have made deliveries from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer-2014 sanctions were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which exclude boys from the ban on Atlantic salmon and falcons, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, mountains and garlic for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be mitigated.
While some restaurants exist in uncertainty.
According to the East-West company, one of HoReCa's largest suppliers, the share of imports in the premium segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dorgo restaurants will have to change the menu under the production of local farmers and other countries," says Sergey Mironov, a restaurant owner of the Restconsalt Agency.
If the boss's strong, it's not gonna be a problem for him.
We only have very little of that, and a new menu can be developed for two or three months.
The Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge restaurant is ready for this: to give up 10-15% visas, another half menu is to be processed.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, for example, a steak made of marble beef is already being replaced, says Sergey Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by the Russian, Belarusian cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, by the representatives of the East-West company Oksana Glibchuk.
Drainage and milk production from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
A U.S. chicken may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seven from Norway, salmon, seven from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of fruit and vegetables from European production can be offset by the production of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, the budget network restaurants would be transformed more simply than the premium segment: there were hardly any gourmets that could distinguish the Italian mozarel from the Russian.
Although it would be difficult for the Ginza Project institutions, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its menus.
There will be a time for replacement," Mironov says.
In Ginza, the comments were rejected, referring to the lack of owners in the country.
Café owners of the Caucasian and Middle Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European
But there are many restaurants whose sanctions are almost out of reach.
These include the kitchens of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the coffee "Wij Me!"
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, based on a lot of chicken files, we don't use exotic vegetables."
In the Colbai institutions, they haven't taken any candles out of the menu yet.
Timura Lanski, the owner of Chihon N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is also not disturbed by the sanctions: he will only have to change his lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia is to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will be cheaper for us than for imports from Europe, he says.
The CIS can be cheaply cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.
However, what they bring from Central Asia is much better than plastics from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes all know they're delicious, sweet.
Nobody says that about the Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Uzbekistan Olymbai Artikov said that he planned to increase the export of fruit products to Russia by two by 2016.
The intention to replace European imports into Russia was expressed almost immediately after the sanctions were imposed by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
The fast-food restaurants that responded to Deneg's request also respond peacefully to sanctions.
McDonald's Press stated that the location exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, the head of the Subway Russia supply department, about 80 per cent of the network purchases in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of fruit and the increase in the prices of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
The term “authorisation products” was at least 4 per cent.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Walker.
KFC, Burger King and "Kroška Cartoška" did not respond to Deneg's request, but other market participants claim that the location of Burger King is significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, the restaurants are ready to buy more Chilean than the Russian Far East
On his hill
While restaurants complain that the demand for prices increases even for local products.
"Grabley's products have grown by an average of 10-15%, and Cherry Mio's Italian restaurant is twice," says Roman Rožnikski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, self-esteem is growing by 5-10 per cent, and Kolbaya acknowledges.
East-West does not deny this: "For example, the Belarusian milk production has travelled 10-15% since early August".
"The Brazilian suppliers have raised prices for pork almost twice," laments Sergey Rack, Deputy Director General Stardogs.
About 35% of the chickens travel.
We're looking for a price from China, maybe they're looking for hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8 per cent.
Now it's so unwelcome to raise prices, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth in the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest post-2010 rate.
Various prices will grow further, he recognizes, but it is not clear how quickly: while most restaurants have been stocked with products for the next two months in the hope of changing purchase prices.
But what will happen two months later, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow Mary, there are dozens of curtains decorated with greenery and wood.
In the middle of the stage, musicians play whales.
It's a regional product festival called "There's a Time."
"We've been going on a local food party for a long time, and here we've been through a lot of sanctions, we've organized a festival," one of the organizers said.
On the scene with Greek-brown musicians Anastas prepares salad from macarone and homemade confectionery, the day was a master class in the preparation of a box with caramelized apples.
All Russian products are certified by organizers.
The exhibition of the achievements of the Russian population in the camps.
Honey from Baschiria, Olenina from Saleharda, fruits from the sub-moscal "Lenin's Sovhoza", cheese from the obscurous Italian Jay Clouza.
"The salmon for restaurants can easily be replaced by another fish of salmon species from the Far East," says the owner of the fish-fishing "Your people" Philip Galkin.
We've got the kidney, the cat, the cockroach, the gorilla, the cockroach, the royal salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as a Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
The Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he won't even move.
And you can't hold our far-east salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian family mozarel
In the fall of his tent lies the beds with the beard "Magadan", the shin, the hummingbird, the mediums with the Kremlin, the diggers from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's been a long time since the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 amount to more than 4 million tonnes, a significant proportion of fish falls in Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are around 800 thousand tonnes.
The Love of His People has been working since 2012, selling fish through the Internet store, serving another half a dozen restaurants, such as the "Empty Things".
There have now been applications for 15 more restaurants to Galkin.
The same dry land can be made from our fish, it's burning.
We're frozen, we've tried different recipes.
We're now selling sushi through the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheap several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation of Galkin's hat, they're making me a "Piladelphia" with a cat.
Unlike the roles of seven, they have to live longer, but the knowledge that this fish is our family adds strength.
On the site of "Your People" there are even roles from the paltose and the sea otter.
In sushi bars, it is true that replacing the Norwegian salmon prefers Chilean.
Galkin explains this because I'm going to make new recipes with long-east fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," explains the owner of the Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
The same is true of other products: Russian producers could take advantage of the freeing thread, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and successor of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimov project, imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America could now be replaced.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to replace the prohibited imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
That is to say, the major producers of other countries have won from the ban," Akimov said.
On the other hand, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
Three McDonald's companies in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg have been temporarily suspended following the mass out-of-the-range checks of the Rosusean Guard.
"We are studying the nature of the claims made to determine the actions needed to speed up the opening of restaurants for visitors," said Dengam in McDonald's press service.
No one really understands what's going to happen.
If all is restricted to product sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an anonymous staff member of the restaurant consultant.
But if McDonald's is going to be closed all over the country, the script will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of IBRD documents
Cascade payments can be received without IDBDs, so the CB intends to promote the implementation of the Euro-Protocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidance that, from 1 September of this year, an insured car will be able to attend without the IDBD.
To be true, it is only when an accident has been reported on the "Europrotocol" without the involvement of the road police.
In other words, if only two cars were involved in the TTP, there were no physically injured persons, no damage exceeded the limit set, and both drivers reached agreement on who was responsible for the accident.
From 2 August, the Euro-Protocol ceiling is 50 thousand rubbs, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad areas, it will increase to 400 thousand rubbs.
The point is that, often even in the case of minor injuries, in a situation where the DTP can be formed through the "Europrotocol", the drivers who have fallen into the accident are causing the DPS.
Because if there was a helmet, it was not possible to get a refund without the IDBD.
The parameters set out in the draft guidelines are intended to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the Euro-Protocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment of VAT-related helmets made without IBRD staff should not be lower than the limit on “Euro-protocol”.
However, it cannot be higher than the limit laid down in the helmet insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS and roads.
But it's probably not going to get a lot of drivers or insurance.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payment for helmets.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the former Russian conservative.
In most cases, the driver will wait hours for the inspector to form a small accident because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known that it will be easy to beat the frauds or convince the drivers of the reliability of the Euro-Protocol.
The safety certificate shall be named and unresolved
Minfin wants to prohibit the depositary's certificates on the claimant, so he will allow banks to make them like an unrelenting contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that prohibits the depositary of certificates on the supplier.
This instrument has recently gained popularity, since the rates here are higher than on bank contributions.
The case is that the depositary certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are handled cheaply by the bank, as no deposit should be made in the Fund of the Investment Insurance Agency (ASA).
The plight of this step is that it is planned to be taken by small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and are affected by it by Sberbank and Bank Moscow, which, according to the ASA, control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASA, is that the clients of a small bank that bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money in the ASA if the licence is withdrawn.
Some investors who do not have sufficient financial literacy and purchase savings certificates on the claimant may assume that their investments are insured.
The underlying lack of insurance payments for these certificates in the event of a withdrawal of a licence from the bank may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In practice, there were cases where applicants were trying to obtain a legal redress," the ASA stated.
The problem is, of course, inspiring.
No one will be able to pay certificates to buyers, since they have no right under the law to be reimbursed by the State.
If it were a case that an instrument was not insured in the ASA, the metal accounts would be prohibited with it, which are taken into account by citizens in grams of one of the four metals, gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but they are not being tried.
It is likely that certificates on the applicant are a very valuable paper that can actually act as Quasidens.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any client of the bank may purchase a certificate, pass it on to any citizen, and before such a certificate can be found, a number of owners may change.
By no means does the draft law stipulate that the certificate of protection must be a valid price paper which must be stored in the depositary.
In order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early liquidation.
That is to say, there is a similar unrelenting contribution that the bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
The outcome was protested by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the centre of Newport on a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff's warhouse for what was described as antisammite.
Stephen Fairclau was watching us on the development of events during the weekend and talking to the protestors who came all the way from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will place weapons in Iraq to counter the militants of the Islamic State terrorist group, reporting ITAR-TASS on 31 August with reference to a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the FRG Government in the head of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send 30 portable anti-tank missiles to Iraq and 500 charges to Milan, as well as 8,000 storms of G3 and G36.
The provisions will be implemented by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate an additional 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a statement by the Government on the subject.
So far, Germany has not put its weapons in hot spots.
The views of the Frogs on the shipment of arms to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that it is only possible to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The police subpoenaed a Ukrainian patrol station in the Azov Sea.
The Donetsk militias submerged a Ukrainian patrol station in the Azov Sea, ITAR-TASS reported on 31 August.
According to the available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the local Shirokino and the Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupoli).
A number of Ukrainian media reported shooting two yards of coast guard.
It is clear that the incident occurred today at around 4:20 p.m.
Adolescents took the helicopters from the Blue Mountains
Two young Bušuokares were delivered to the helicopter safely after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
The 16-year-old girl and the 18-year-old went on a journey shortly after Sunday in Govets Lip in Blackheit.
Concerned relatives called the police about eight nights before they returned home.
A search team was sent, including local police and rescue teams, and a couple found about 11 evenings around Bridal Weil.
The girl was hurt by the knee, and the young man fell in the head.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on breakfast Monday morning.
They were taken to a ambulance in a stable condition at the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Two Unions met
The negotiations at the summit in Minsk did not solve the problems raised but gave rise to a new format: the European Union's first people met with the first people of the future of the Eurasian
Let it be also alarmed (the situation around Ukraine is not suffering from delays), EU and Customs Union leaders discussed a number of "burning problems" for the first time.
If such a structure is capable of working effectively, it is impossible; therefore, it is clear who removed the debris from the summit.
The questions were raised on 26 August, when the Belarusians followed them and other Europeans saw the audience of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader was an example of outstanding courtesy, it was the conduct of a man who had just broken the Jackpot - and planned a decent old age in the highest society.
How Maydan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak on their behalf at the final briefing - not just the President's legitimacy with a 20-year internship.
This is an application for recognition by Minsk as a full-fledged European politician and a major mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Senior Analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Dennis Melianz, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to the Minash as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met the aunt-a-tet with Lucashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will be frozen further," he said.
The iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the collapse of the Belarusian authorities began long before the Mayan in Kiev in November 2013.
“The results have been achieved, and with the EU, successful visa facilitation and readmission negotiations, dialogues on modernization,” says the interviewer Fireka, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The States even took some sanctions.
With regard to Ukraine's events, they themselves and their reaction to the leadership of Belarus have only undermined the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, has managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, a Belarusian leader, who de jure, did not recognize the accession of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Pro-Society militias in Donbass, did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk has not come from either the Customs Union or the OTCB, and the Russian base is located in Baranovic.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it by the Belarusian experts.
As successful as Lukashenko is moving towards political diversification, it will be seen how often in the near future Minsk will have to meet in the form of EU+TS.
In the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Katherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected from relations in a new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Kosiancic has just stated "The Fire", that in the light of the war and peace issues, this issue is not a priority.
It was reported that the next meeting on the issue of Ukraine with the participation of the first persons in the new format could also become Kazakhstan.
The Chief of Staff for Minsk has made a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaeva, in which he has acknowledged that he is personally requested by the representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko pointed out that all parties did not mind that Minsk should remain a central place for meetings both in the form of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the Eurocommission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" is a full-fledged European leader who helps solve the global problem.
A European Farmer’s Best Friend
The composition of the EU delegation, including the Eurocommissions on Trade and Energy, has already emphasized the conclusion: the main sub-optimal of the summit is not the tragic situation in Donbass but the economy.
Indeed, the forthcoming negotiations on gas supply and overcoming the fears of the TS countries on the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU are more ambitious than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, pointed out that EU representatives “come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences rather than the opposite.”
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine is also "working" in Belarus.
Its consequences -- and, above all, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia -- give Minsk, which is still undergoing the sanctions, a long-term field for manoeuvre.
According to the Head of the Misses Research Centre, former candidate for President Jaroslav Romanchuk of Belarus, European investors are actively interested in Belarus's ability to deliver agricultural products to the RF in the course of sanctions.
The supply schemes for which Vladimir Putin has hurried to the summit are being put forward.
"The initiators of this scheme," said Romanchuk "Ognyk", "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out product supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
The Russian business is urgently needed to restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian structures.
The second issue - the expert continues - relates to the fact that many Ukrainian companies will not continue to produce production in Belarus from Ukraine as well as to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have around $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian trade schemes can now be very expensive."
In Romania's view, the role of the owner of the EU and TS negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the loss of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions is estimated at 5-10 billion euros, while the Eurocommission has now offered only 125 million euros to the farmers.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact of Eurofarmers.
This may raise Lukashenko's credibility in the EU at an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk is re-engaged from its active role in the TS+EU format, while the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the new format was the originator and was the only one who became Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without having to discuss anything, not to take a decision from the barracks, after the signing of the Treaty on Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that had been in Ukraine at that time," he appealed to the Chambers of Peter Poroshenko.
On the other hand, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, and it was heard that it was against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, they strongly stress that Belarus does not pursue useful goals in the organization of EU and TS interactions on its ground, and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, particularly in the field of security, raise and promote the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said "Ognaku" in the Middle of Belarus, a department where words have been scrupulously chosen lately.
A free entry zone can appear in Moscow
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of free entry zones as a means of combating overcrowding of central roads similar to other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Moscow Mayor on transport, Maxim Lukstukov.
One of the options that he has successfully recommended is a pay entry.
That's an expert opinion, we're going to have to study it, we're going to look at all the negatives and the positives.
To talk about some decisions in this regard, as early as possible," Lukushtov said.
Zammer stressed that the capital authorities had a very important experience of Asian cities, which, in terms of structure and load, was similar to Moscow.
One of the decisions taken by these countries was the construction of a central wheel highway, added Lukstuov.
The recent construction of the Central Wheel Road is an example of not having to miss all traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient traffic infrastructure to travel, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," the mayor noted.
Maxim Lukstuov also stated that the introduction of pay-parks had significantly derailed the tables.
And, he said, the chairmen are not planning to stop on what they have achieved.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, attended the ceremony of the construction of the first Moscow Central Wheel Road (CCD).
Sketch is wrong
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "The City of Sins 2: The woman for whom it is worth killing" has not accomplished the revolution that could have been expected from him.
The first "Golden of Sins" (2005), taken from the minimal but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantino, has revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary novels.
Sikvel is also a revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental to modern thinking of the string of "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" (if you understand under this space nuara and under the antithesis-comix space).
It should now be read: "thesis is antithesis is chaos."
"The City of Sins-2" is chaotic both at the dramatic, and at the philosophical level: both times he is chaotic in the foolish sense of words.
Yes, some of the heroes are known for the first "Gorod", although, here's the noise of Marv (Micky Rourk), he remembers, he ended up living on an electric chair, and here, nothing else, he manages to excite - as a folk's wife - from the air of knife and other punches with punches.
But the old men literally take off a bunch of novels, like breaking into a city from another movie, about the meaning and purpose of which the viewers ask not to worry.
So, his story, foolishly addressed by the authors in the most interesting place, is in the superlative game of Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Its own is the desire-freety Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something she's vindictive to Duyta (Josh Brooklyn).
But this confusion in which Duyta, let's say, in the face we don't distinguish ourselves from Johnny -- the more people, like other parts of the body, wear characters with incessant regularity, not trouble, not even half-life.
They're not people, but we understand that they're the archetypes of a nuara: a year-old bitch who's too sure of herself to play a "moon hunt" for a sex detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when an archetype waltzs with an archetype and an archetype runs, it's not a movie anymore, but it's an abstract image.
And asking abstract drawing questions about the logic of the subject is just ridiculous.
In addition, even in this contaminant world, there is something constant.
The warheads of the first "City" continue to maintain a circular defense against their native forces in the dark.
Yeah, and Detective Hartigan's ghost is not, and they're gonna look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of the State of Sins-2 is the other.
Frank Miller was very good at how a painter put together comics and nuar talents, and how the director turned his mind on how to carry comics on the screen.
Comics and nuars are two aggressively opposite "realities".
A contemporary comical phenomenon was born at the end of the 1920s, when the Roman Dashil Hemmet "Crowding Harvest" (1929), "Maltian Soccoli" (1930) and "Screary Key" (1931) created a cannon named after the hard-boiled school.
Well, or pop fiction.
The comics gave Gollivud many dozens of heroes: from the seamen Pope, the eater of the spy giving him a rich power, Supermen, Batman and the sculptor Dick Tracy to Hulk, Tora, Man-Pawka and other "guilters".
But in any comic film, there was something harmful: the cartoons were not constantly trying to raise the screen, they were left behind in the surrounding world's “real” world of trouble.
I'm just saying, they've been completely deprived of "existence."
Nour, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After World Wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, character, family scandals, and historical background - has lost all confidence.
What are the Forsites, which Tibo and Rugon Makcara, which even the Balkan and Rostos are thought to be after Verden, Osvencim and Hiroshima?
Such a novel had a peaceful change in the form of a mill opera, and a criminal - that is, a marginal - novel had risen to the level of the philosophical prose.
Hammet on his skin found out it was working as a health worker on the front.
He was a communist.
Like, at least, they were close to the competition and the columns of the genre, such as authors Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, director Jul Dassen, Joseph Louzie, Edward Dmitrick.
So the nour, whose archetype they put, first, rough and cynic, and secondly, really social.
I don't know if that's the American version of socrealism.
The first "Mother of Sins" was remarkable in that it was unnatural, but organically combined comics with nuara.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book lived, not in the narrowness of its graphic nature, but in a "present" film.
The darkness of the sale world, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered the monster son-sadist, was worthy of Hammet.
And the vivid details of the cut heads that the sadist decorated his nest, the premier of genius James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best - that is, a declaratively gifted representative of the Neonura.
"The City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitalization of the radical stylistic of Miller-Rodrigues before the comical tradition.
It's probably a lot of things that happened because of 3D technologies.
When you look at the second "Crowd of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass layer in which the snow sleeps a toy.
But most of all, it's not snow, it's blood clots, but what's the difference?
Well, it's about sociality and saying something.
It is possible only when somewhere we have sometimes let go to the edge of the dirty mud, but there is a normal world where you can return the girl lying on the curve or say to the desperate parents that the loser is punished.
And when there is no place of sin in the city, except sin, then there is no sin but that within it; and there is no sin but that within it is a law.
It's boring, like any rule.
The chaos of "The City of Sin-2" is just boring.
For the sake of justice the family curse gave this fine sin a small but a small one.
The titres warn: the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
With regard to maturity, the very vegetative episode in which a person is crushed with his fingers gives him a hell of a humor.
Hammet would like it.
The socialists of France must "close and bring France in order," said the key ally of Frásua Holland
Mr. Wall called for the deep-separated left forces to “show a warm attitude” towards the attacking President-socialist whose interpretations had not been approved by the vast majority of French people.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling out the applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his Government would not question the 35-hour working week in France, despite the proposal for a heated conflict, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macronom, the new Minister of Economic Affairs earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland asked his Socialist Party associates to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tober, the Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels by bringing together the disagreeable members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost their faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pe, the leader of the far right of the National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among Socialists, said that she did not imagine that the new Walla Government would last for more than a few months.
François Holland is the naked king, but the naked prince and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to assemble a new government when the summer was not over.
"And the new one won't last long either in autumn or winter," Mrs. Penn told reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, said she was confident that the party could easily win the early elections and be ready to run.
The leading French party survived a riot in the March municipal elections, and the very right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
The survey of the resurrected Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of being divided into several rival factions until the end of the presidential term of Mr. Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician at the University of cyan Po, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new Socialist Government failed to correct the economy and the record unemployment.
"He has little time, but the public opinion needs to quickly feel what's going on," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
"The City Without Drugs" is gone.
The Sverdlovska arbitral tribunal left without considering the request of the Regional Ministry for the Management of Hostage to the State without Drugs Fund.
The government was planning to recover more than 7 million rubs from the organization as a rental fee in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the complainant did not appear twice in court.
Today, the Sverdlova District Arbitration Court has left the State Property Administration Executive Directorate (MUGISO) without consideration to the State without drugs fund (one of the founders, Mayor of Ekaterinburg Evgenien Roizeman).
Representatives of the district authorities sought to borrow 7.3 million rubs from the organization as a rent fee for the building.
It was known today that the complainant had not appeared twice before the court, and therefore a decision had been taken to refuse the hearing.
Because of the lack of a representative in the IUGISO department to explain, the Chief of Legal Division Maxim Titov did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund has also failed to contact representatives.
Remember, this is an individual who has been in the city centre on the street of Bellinski, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
Such a decision was taken by ex-Governor Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Sverdlovska Region filed a request to the Sverdlovska arbitral tribunal for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the department requested through the court to recognize an unencumbered contract of free use as a memorial space.
According to the IUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include substantial conditions for renting cultural heritage.
The Sverdlovska arbitral court rejected the claim, and the 17th arbitral court of Perma, which was satisfied, was appealed.
In the same court, the fund filed a cassation complaint against the decision, which remained unresolved, after which the decision was appealed by the fund in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court accepted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease contract was concluded, on which the fund began to pay the rent again, and the head of the city of Evgenien Roiseman said so.
The rental fee was set at 300 thousand rubs a month.
The previous administration of the area transferred this building to us for free, recognizing our duty to fight drugs, in respect of the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.

Why Mayor Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the proud deputy of Ekaterinburg, Alexander Kosinzev, invited the mayor of the city, the proud speaker of Evgian Roizman, to resign.
The case was criminal in relation to the suspect in the murder of a retired member of the pride of Oleg Kineva, who was considered a mayor ' s accomplice.
How Eugija Roizman found a criminal case
On 1 July, it became known that there was a criminal case of the fact of “debt” (art. 128.1 UC RF) in the Ekaterinburg Mayor's blog Evgenia Roizman.
This was reported by Anna Filatov, Director of the Legal Centre for Protection, in the Sverdlova area.
According to her statement, Mr. Roseman accused her of being a member of the blog that she had reportedly committed crimes committed by her ex-husband.
Mary Ekaterinburg is convinced that "it's a regular attempt to avenge the truth."
The iPhone is turned into a cookie.
Before 9 September, when Apple was due to present its new development, the press reported all the new developments that could be expected from the presentation.
With reference to American media sources, the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile cookie as a result of the joint project Apple and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and Re/code, on the presentation of new products on 9 September, Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which will make the new iPhone 6 smartphone available.
The companies themselves reject any comments on this matter.
This function allows you to pay cash to a store using a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will have NFC (near field communication) technology for the first time, which will allow for a non-contact payment using a smartphone and the corresponding cash-reader.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that entered the so-called NFC Forum, an association for the advancement of this technology.
The first NFC phone was issued by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented a Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and to be distributed via a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts stress that, despite the major investments of high-tech companies in the forwarding of NFC technology, U.S. riders are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on their stores with such systems.
Hence, observers now hope that Apple's entry into the market will make it faster and more active in its trading areas.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the end of the negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to reports of people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and secured customers of Prestige Cruises, as it competes with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, reporting sources on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also holds 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The sources were asked to remain anonymous, as negotiations were not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent higher than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together hold eight cruise vessels operating in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India, in the years to come.
The forward-looking companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered in U.S. regulatory bodies for the initial public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's principal shareholder after a $850 million transaction in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was established as it now exists, in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the entertainment conglomerate and the casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting had a share of 28 per cent, Apollo had a share of 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP had a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June, according to the report.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of the cruise traffic flows in North America, according to registration documents at the first public placement of Prestige Cruises shares.
The Crimean TV company can receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
In Minkomsvezi, Russia is proposing to allocate 250 million rubs to the Crimean State Radio Company in 2014.
As indicated in the draft order of the Minkomsvezi, which is located on a single portal for the preparation of regulatory acts, the subsidy is intended to be spent “to cover the cost of creating conditions for the extensive information of the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be available for the purchase of equipment, roof repair and energy security systems in the 1959 radio company building, reports "RIA News".
Activists of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement hold a speech by the Chinese representative the following day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly on Sunday defined a procedure whereby only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the election of Hong Kong leader in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the majority of members of the movement committee, which is likely to be the domain of Beijing ' s loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to become a ballot and has forced the activists of the democratic movement to promise again to stop the Hong Kong Financial Centre with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders are afraid that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the Beijing publication of a document describing China's control of Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business centre and set up a sit-in ambush.
Briefing Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Office for Communications in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People ' s Assembly of Representatives of Zang Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao State Council of Feng Wei also had to make a series of briefings during the day.
Activists stated that they would gather at the Hong Kong Government's headquarters in the afternoon.
The United Kingdom has not mentioned the democratic governance of Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 ha of the Palestinian autonomy-owned land
The Israeli authorities announced that they would join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
According to Bibi-si, the decision to join the country South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
On the capture of the territory, the Ministry of Defence of Israel announced on Sunday and ordered military administration on the west coast.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, the world community should call on Israel to respond to the “continuous settlement activity on the west bank of Jordan and in East Jerusalem”.
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the statehood of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be reviewed in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Prorussian rebels as well as to match the clear strategy it was expected from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: To help separatists to take up the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia actual independence in order to get closer to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with Putin State First Television, the Ukrainian military campaign against the return of detained separatists in the eastern areas of Donetsk and Lugansk, which were seized in March and April following Moscow's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March, condemned the return of Ukraine.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently named the territories seized by Novorosia, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolutional days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace negotiations will take place in the near future when Ukrainian policies begin campaigning for parliamentary elections on 26 October and when government forces attack peaceful settlements in the separatists of the regions, the Illusion Guard, reported ITAR-TASS.
"We must start the substantive negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political system of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to satisfy the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussing for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The intervention of the press secretary Kremlin to correct Putin ' s “infidel interpretation” stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to take a separatist stand in the east rather than the open grip of Crimea, where most of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donecko and Lugano area of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million non-Russians are, and pre-conflict surveys have shown broad support for the wish to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to define trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by handing over to the Kremlin the actual control over the territory that would unite the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
The main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic maritime resorts, is located on the Black Sea peninsula, which was a five-month accession.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov Region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and lithium plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, during his opening speech on 7 June, that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, amend the Constitution to give the regions more control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be very different from that of Kremlin and the rebel separatists, whose weapons and incitements are being accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to agree with the separatists' leaders, as well, followed the new arrivals of the rebels last week after the Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the former peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over the city of Novozazovsk in the event that Ukrainian security officials said they were afraid that it was the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory before Crimea itself.
This has resulted in extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupola, a steel gate with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between the Novoazovsk and the close passage to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, he called on the European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent at the age of 23.
"We're approaching the point of no return," Warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign soldiers and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Addiska after two columns of Russian bronze and 1,000 soldiers had entered the Danube region last week to support the difficulties faced by separatists, Colonel Andrey Lysenko, the Press Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were reportedly detained in Addis Ababa as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday with 10 Russian airmen arrested in the Ukrainian territory last week, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
Photo-based scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelstein expressed his aversion to hackers who may have stolen his pregnant wife Gabi Greco's picture and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was upset after a number of exposed photos depicting Jennifer Laurens had entered the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
The hacker, who is responsible for this, says that there are about 60 exposed photos of the star "Golden Games" Lawrence and the superstars, including the models Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, the singer Ryanna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and the actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Ivan Strahovski and living in Melbourne Greece also reportedly stole photos from the iCloud escape.
In list 101, the names of the celebrities.
Adelsten, who made a proposal to Greece last month, said Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly said to the news site that the hacker attack was "crazy" and that those to whom she was sent "felt that they were attacked".
The hacker is supposed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Spidmen, including two frames where it lies in the pool with a loaded chest.
Palmer's work in the movie includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, a movie star "Chak" Strahovski and an actress from "Prohibited Acceptance" Browning yesterday did not comment on stolen photographs.
The representative of Lawrence TMZ said, "This is a sudden invasion of private life."
Actor Set Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Relate photos stolen from the mobile phone, in fact, nothing is different from the sale of stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
A potential way to steal photos of detected celebrities has been found
The massive explosion of the star accounts may have been caused by vulnerability in the Find My Phone annex.
The potential scenario for the development of events described the resource The Next Web.
A Python script was published on Github's resource, which enabled you to select the passwords for the Find My Phone service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The same log link and the Apple ID password is used to access it, as well as to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities have been stolen.
The script enabled you to get a password from Find My Phone.
This method is consistent with all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password options in the Find My Phone service was unlimited.
In the correct organization of the security system, after several unsuccessful attempts, the incorrect password must be blocked and reported to the user.
Due to vulnerability, users received no reports of attempts to improve their account password.
The hackers knew the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to the Twitter user Hackapp, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program was written to her.
To date, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource was connected to the Hackapp user and he noted that the above vulnerability was characteristic of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the star account.
It's not me, etc.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister reported on a number of occasions
While there is no strong evidence that the use of this service has been used for the theft of photos in Find My Phone, there has been a wave of harmful actions.
The hackers took over the control of the device and demanded redemption from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the security of the cloud had not been compromised in that case, but did not investigate how users had lost their accounts.
Russians had also been hacked into Twitter by Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev.
If the criminals had access to the iCloud as described above, there could be a password for the government's head account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource could not get Apple's comments on the vulnerability to Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukraine five years ago
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian sportsman, Anne Burraq.
The relevant order has been published on the legal information web portal.
At the beginning of this year, the sportsman moved to Russia to a permanent place of residence and asked the Federation to provide her with the opportunity to speak for the RF collection.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won a silver medal in Europe's personal championship and became a world champion in a mixed stadium, which is one of the new kinds of sports programmes.
It maintains leadership positions in the current season.
In accordance with the rules to take place at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, it will be required to obtain special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Burrick is not the first Ukrainian sportsman to change his nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian chess passport to Ekaterine Lagno, the Livvo breeding woman, who is the double champion of Europe (2005), peace on the block (2010) and fast chess [14].
The Ukrainian women's team was the winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the world's team champion in Astana (2013) and the European team champion in Warsaw (2013).
SCR terminated investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Nukovo
The Russian Investigation Committee (RCC) has terminated the criminal case of the Tu-204 aircraft crash of Red Wings.
This is reported by the department's press.
The decision was taken with regard to the death of the commander of the aircraft and the bartender.
The judicial expert showed that the result of the disaster was an increase in landing speed, failure to carry out standard landing procedures, and an unintended exit of engines for increased direct traffic.
The Tou-204 aircraft of Red Wings, following the Prague-Moscow flight, suffered a crash on 29 December 2012 at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The airship flew over the airfield and burned down.
At the scene, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot, and the bartender were killed.
Two pilots were delivered to the treatment facilities, where they subsequently ended up with injuries.
Three other pilots, hospitalized with severe bodily injury, have undergone long treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car was severely damaged at the time of the Kiev Shoss disaster.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the disaster, the Transport Prosecutor ' s Office carried out a check on Red Wings, which identified numerous violations.
In February 2013, the company's licence was suspended.
The company resumed its work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelienco started training in SISO
A well-known Russian blended-out 33-year-old, Alexander Emelijanenko, who is in the SISO on the charge of sexual assault against the domestic worker, has been completely cured and trained.
That's what the Championship reports.
In May this year, the Russian Investigation Committee filed an accusation against Alexander Emelianenko in rape.
The suspect was reported on the investigation and was detained in Tambova on 9 May following a road accident, resulting in a fracture of the thigh.
The Emelianko-younger was arrested by 31 August and sentenced on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred and the investigation insisted on extending the term of detention until 30 September.
If a sportsman is found guilty, he is threatened with imprisonment for up to six years.
What power, brother?
Lenta.ru remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelienko's career
Emelianenko held his last unit in January of this year and lost his technical roommate Dmitri Sosnowsky.
Alexander is the youngest brother known as Fedora Emelianenko.

Anger was the most universal and functional human emotion
A person ' s hearty expression is biologically universal to humanity, and every organ and group of muscles involved in it is not random, but is an additional means of expression of power and threat, discovered by scientists in Australia and the United States.
They told about their openings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the persons who are pushed down and down the gates, drawn in the thin line of the mouth, scattered noses, is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blinder than the birth of a child, who has never seen it, notes the lead author of the Aaron Sell study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has arisen to deal effectively with disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage a person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his circumstances, and he brings it to the interviewer with anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and go to work, think that they have the right to impose on others conditions that are not beneficial to them, and prefer strong conflict resolution methods to peaceful ones.
Taking away from the fact that anger is primarily a “emotion of the market”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of mice that create angry expressions should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer, thus making it possible to agree as soon as possible with his or her conditions in order to avoid conflict.
To verify this hypothesis, the researchers modeled on a computer person where each of the seven elements of an angry person was present or not, and showed them to the informants.
Although the missing bridges or the ledge in advance did not make the individual evil, the more powerful physical participants of the study were unanimously recognized by such human drawings.
Man's anger, as in animals, is a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own power, which makes him agree and submit.
A person spreads his nose and lifts his lips for the same purpose as a spoon that is pumping, or a baboon that shows his claws.
“Angrily “starts” by refusing to accept the situation of the interviewer, and the person immediately takes the form of the most effective demonstration by the opposing party of the consequences of the refusal.
But the most striking is that none of the elements of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same," noted Anthropologist John Tuby.
Mincoms have proposed to allocate 250 million rubles to the Crimean Radio Company.
Minkomswiss proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget of the autonomous non-commercial organization Teleradio Company Crime in 2014.
This is reflected in the draft Government decision prepared by the department to which Lenta.ru was introduced.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be "to cover the cost of creating conditions for the extensive information of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment".
In particular, the dedicated money is intended to convert the equipment block, videotape, central equipment and video server.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fiber optic communications line (WOLS) and the maintenance of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the federal budgets provided for in the Minkomsvezi.
The Crimean State Broadcasting Company was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, the coverage of the television broadcast is more than 75 per cent of the territory of the peninsula.
In 2011, the Crimean Television Company received a digital television licence.
