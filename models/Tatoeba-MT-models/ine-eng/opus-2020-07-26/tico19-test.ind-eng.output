How long have these symptoms been going on?
And all breasts should be handled in this way especially at your age
And along with the fever
and your blood pressure and cholesterol also need to be checked.
And are you in a fever now?
And do you feel these breasts now?
And do you also have difficulty breathing?
And can you tell me the other symptoms you've experienced together with this?
And how high is your fever ever?
And I'm also stuck.
And I'm a little bit of a stick and a stick.
And I feel a heavy chest pain today.
And this is the age of rhinitis allergy.
and feels like a doll.
And I think I'm a little bit of a chicken too.
And I want you to explain where your breasts are.

Are there symptoms or other problems that you notice together with your muscles?
Is there someone else who's sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
Do you feel another symptom?
Have you ever felt a breath?
Do you still feel chest pain?
Because this is the flu season.
But we can't also afford to be sidetracked from the heart.
But the more important problem now is this chest.
And I feel a difficulty breathing
But I know a lot of bad people are in my way.
but we need to handle every chest of breast very seriously.
But now you can breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this chest.
Does it feel like someone's taking your chest?
Still feels like a breath.
Do they complain about the same symptoms?

The cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) which increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) shows a similar train in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK that confirms that, despite its different degrees depending on the country, COVID-19 has developed very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units, it is necessary to increase its readiness to launch COPID-19 patients who will need medical care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the pneumonia cluster with etiology was reportedly unknown in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tigkok.
On January 9, 2020, the Control and Prevention Centre Tionkok reported that this disease is a new coronavirus now called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far shows that about 80% of the COVID-19 sufferers have a mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with most of the suffering cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 has developed into a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of other cases have a critical disease that requires intensive care.
The patient's mortality in the hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 cumulative incident train in the European Union/Economic Region (EU/EEA) and British Ray (UK) and compared it with the incident in Hubei Province, Tionkok.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases currently in EU/EEA and UK countries with the number of cases in Italy during January 31–15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
After Tionkok, the COVID-19 has experienced a wider geographical preaching and dynamics of the COVID-19 in the rest of the world as it follows the dynamics of the Tionkok.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
At Eurosurveillance 2020, published on 5 March, Spiterie et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed on the basis of the WHO case definition.
In EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tigkok.
On 15 March 2020, the COVID-19 case was detected throughout 30 EU/EEA and Ingris Raya (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with that date, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get the COVID-19 case numbers and the COVID-19 incident
At the European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide is updated every day at 8 a.m.
This data is used to evaluate the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it with the train in Italy.
As an active prevalence proxy in the case of COVID-19, we count the cumulative incidents of 14 days, so calculate the natural journey of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK, during the period January 1-15 March 2020.
We also provided the number of cases that were reported to each country by 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. compared with the case of Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
Cumulative incident train crashed 14 days of the COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and the UK in general followed a train in Hubei Province (Tigkok) (Gambar 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative COVID-19 incident began to increase about February 21, and then increased hardware around February 28, 2020.
This train is mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar cumulative COVID-19 incident increase (In addition).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data indicates that, by 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparable to or less than the total number of Italy's three weeks earlier.
The results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The train observed on the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that the pandemium is increasing at a speed comparable to that in all countries.
This is derived from the degree of differences between countries, a variation in the response to public health, and the possibility of a different definition of the case between countries and a different protocol to choose the patient to be tested for the confirmation of the COVID-19, which includes a case-by-case examination.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who are affected explained the situation about 10% of COPID-19 patients need intensive care and media sources report that the hospital and intensive care unit in this region have reached its maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case reception data in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level are available only for 6% and 1% of cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and nursing facilities in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and nursing per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The model scenario is related to the lack of health care capacity, with estimates of the prevalence of the COVID-19 case concern for each EU/EEA country and the UK associated with risk >90% over the sleeping capacity of intensive care, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Because so far the most classified cases in certain EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are usually serving a population of a number of regional services, information on cases and intensive care sleep is best provided at the United Kingdom Area Planning Level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and the current train in other countries has shown that the COVID-19 runways are growing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COPID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, as in the affected area in Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC rapid risk analysis, a fast, proactive, and understanding approach is very important to delay the SARS-CoV-2 preaching, with a change from a detachment approach to a sweetening approach, because a rapid increase in the number of cases, as expected, may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it is not previously applied.
The rapid risk assessment also outlines public health steps to mitigate the impact of pandemics.
There is a short chance window when the country has the opportunity to increase its control in the slowing down of SARS-COV-2 and reduces the stress on health care.
If failure occurs, the health care system of another EU/EEA country is likely to face a patient who needs intensive care within a few days or weeks to come.
The plague of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tigkok and elsewhere in the world, causing human suffering.
Smells like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from the vertebrae and caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Even so, COVID-19 has lower rates of depression and mortality than SARS, but more and more about age than young people, and more about men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this new disease, this article tries to provide timely and understandable research on the subject of rapid research.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this move will help us to understand and fight this dangerous disease.
The Semi Festival, on January 25, 2020, has become an unprecedented memory for all Tionghoa people who were ordered to stay at home for vacation and a few weeks later because of the new virus disease.
This virus is very homologous with the coronal virus (COV) that caused the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was given the name SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, Tigkok, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has caused 80,000 COVID-19 cases confirmed, with more than 40,000 patients deployed and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy and potential to destroy stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report of January 7, 2020, which established a virus-insulated sequence of several patients, more than 200 were published about the COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
The goal is to include research progress in the field of this rapidly expanding new subject.
At some point, we're going to try to compare the COVID-19 with SARS and the other coV disease, which is the Middle East breathing syndrome (MERS, 2012 plague).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about disease prevention and forecasting, as well as some outstanding questions but pressing on.
Based on tradition, CoV is considered a nonlethal pathogen for humans, especially causing approximately 15% of the 4th dose.
Even so, in this century, we have found a very pathogenic coV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing the initial plague in Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
That's why, COVID-19 is now the third coV plague in human history recorded.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonia cluster was originally not known for the first time from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of the Republic of Queongkok on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, a coV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, the health care provider infection was reported, indicating that human-human transmission could happen.
On January 23, the district quarantine was conducted in the city of Wuhan, and the general ban was lifted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on this disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly associated with the Wuhan marine food market considered to be the initial site of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30th, WHO declared this plague an emergency of global health.
During this reporting period, the disease has spread to all parts of the world and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Because the situation is developing very quickly, the end of the world and the scourge still needs to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-faceted study in 8,866 patients, comprising 4,021 COPID-19 patients, provided a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected are over 50 years old, only a little under 20 years old, and only 14 are infected under 10 years old.
SARS-COV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expands into the cluster, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 consumes an average time of 5 (2-9) days starting from an interview to a diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time to start from dawn to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive count (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, according to mass transportation time before the Semi Festival in Tigkok.
Patients with confirmed mortality were 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality was adjusted for all patients at 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of male (man), age (≥60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large subfamily of viruses assembled with a single RNA sensor.
CoV can be divided into four kinds, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha and beta-COV known to be human infections.
Glicoprotein tonol or spike (S) binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) exchange enzyme and peptide 4 (DPP4) peptidyl, each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The virus RNA gene is released into the sytoplasm; after replication by virus, the genomic RNA is included in the sample glycoprotein and the protein nucleocapid forms a vesicular containing virion, which then experiences fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first SARS-COV-2 genomic sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-COV-2 is a new type of beta-COV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% of the 10 samples followed; the sample was taken from the original location of the Pacific Ocean Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-COV-2 is more similar to SARS-COV than Mers-Cov.
Through a microcopy of transmission electrons, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very small human breath sequence of epithelium.
ACE2 humans were found to be a receptor for SARS-COV-2 as well as SARS-COV.
However, S SARS-COV-2 protein is associated with human ACE2 weaker than its binding to S SARS-COV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes non-separable infections of SARS-COV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein that is attributed to orf3b and protein that is stored with orf8.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and IFNβ expression inhibition; however, orf8 does not have a known functional or motif domain.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the entire human cryo-EM ACE2 structure in resolution 2.9 Å in complex with the amino carrier B0AT1.
They found that complex, which has open and closed conformation, is designed to form dimer and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which is evidence of coV detection and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in the drug transplant to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate
SARS-COV and MERS-COV are known to come from the vertebrae and each is transmitted to humans through the ossuary and the ossuary.
By comparing the phylogenetic SARS-COV-2 with another coV, the vertebrae is considered to be the original vertebrae of SARS-COV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to the two coVs-like-SARS of the vertebrae called bat-SL-COVZX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, the mean waves that help the virus to overcome the barrier of the species to infect humans are still unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be explained.
Ji, et al. recommend the snake as a vector virus from the pelvis to humans involved in homologous recombination in the protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, suggested that the caller, the breast-mammary mutilated long food commonly used in traditional tionghoa medications, potentiated as a honeycomb between SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homologies on coV found in caller and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the difference spread throughout the genome is still a big difference; therefore, the concrete result as concrete evidence is not yet found (G. 3).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40-50%.
SARS-COV-2 may have a similar quality.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and hot light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, infection containing chlorine, acetatitis, chloroform, and other fatty ruminants, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disables the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-COV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study that reports on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another coV study earlier, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after ingestion, the virus is known by the immune system by means of a field detection receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through a variety of pathways, the virus induces the expression of an inflammatory factor, dendrite cell maturing, and interferon type I (IFN) synthesis, which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagositosis of antigen virus by macrophages.
However, the N protein on SARS-COV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Shortly thereafter, an adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
Cell T CD4+ stimulated cell B to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and cell T CD8+ killed cells that were directly infected by the virus.
The T-assistant cell produces proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cell.
Even so, CoV can inhibit T-cell function by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, is also important in combating virus infections.
For example, the isolated antibodies from patients who have been cured have been neutralized by Mers-CoV.
On the other hand, the exaggerated immune response produced a large number of locally free radicals, which could cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failure of organs and even death.
SARS-COV-2 infection, which is characterized by the avitan cluster, is more about the age with vector disease and pregnant women.
In general, people who are exposed to the virus in large numbers or whose immune function is disrupted have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and the emperor began from 0 to 24 days.
A new study, as explained above, shows that the incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days is based on demographic 8.866 cases.
The most important health authority adapts effective quarantine based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended until 24 days?
Demam is often the primary and early COVID-19 symptoms, with or without other symptoms such as dry stone, breathing, muscle swelling, swelling, headache, throat disease, kidney disease, chest swelling, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the diagnosis of the disease.
In a severe case, the development of patients' disease is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, septic shocks, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who experience fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even if they do not have a pneumonitis, should be prescribed for the diagnosis of this virus.
Demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the proportion of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for durum wheat, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed fan support.
A similar finding has been reported in two recent studies, namely studies on family and cluster clusters caused by transmission from an asymptomatic person.
Compared with that, a demographic study in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-COV also experienced fever (98%), dry fever (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than the COVID-19 patient and are consistent with the MERS lethality higher than the COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and arthralgia (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry rock (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and cholera disease (13-25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and ventilation support needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 accounted for 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed.
The previous study reported that R0 SARS-COV-2 reached 6.47 with confidence interval (CI) 95% to 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-COV only crossed 2 to 4.
Compare SARS-COV-2 to MERS-COV and SARS-COV in the event of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-COV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but does not semi-amiculate MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-COV-2 panmeal is greater than the MARS-COV panmeal and SARS-COV.
Awitans are often found in a family or from a group or a vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before a breakup.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are hospitalized can carry the virus again.
At the initial stage, the patient has normal or descending white cell counts (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia increased in 1,099 COPID-19 patients.
The incidence of heart and muscle enzymes and myoglobin increases in the blood of a number of patients, as well as the C-reactive protein and the plasma is rising in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the rate of D-dimer increased, i.e. the product of fibrin clearance contained in the blood, and the count of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
The difference in the picture of thorax was found in a large COVID-19 patient and marked with a bilateral wall shade or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, tatercontrolal inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravated gas exchange disturbances.
The type I and type II pneumonia function lowers the surface surface pressure and increases the surface pressure so that it lowers the lung capacity to develop and increase the risk of lung collapses.
Therefore, the worst finding in the chest photos is often parallel to the worst disease rate.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis showed pneumonia, hyalin membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, as well as the sensory cell involved a lot in the lungs that died of this disease, according to the pathology of virus and ARDS and the same with the pathological analysis of patients SARS and MERS.
RNA detection SARS-COV-2 through the reverse polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, because of its false negative rate, which can speed up the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) at Tigkok on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations also occur in SARS diagnostics.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiology findings is very important and a need to make effective diagnostics.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group explained the SHERLOCK-based technical usage protocol to detect SARS-COV-2, which detected synthetic RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using cell stick within less than one hour without the need for complex instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if checked for clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with new CoV, the doctor in particular offered supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying various therapies that had been used or previously initiated for other coV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This treatment includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral, immunosuppressive, steroid, plasma from a well-treated patient, traditional Tionghoea, and psychological support.
Even plasma from a patient who has recovered has been recommended for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical company is developing antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-COV-2 mainly attacks lung and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, the use and failure of breathing are a major threat to the patient and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of disease disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the most modified cardiopulmonary technique used to treat heart failure or respiratory threat.
In addition, electrolyte care, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic fungi, and protection of vital organ function are also very important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive immune response is known to cause cytokines in patients with SARS and mers.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction that denotes the release of the cytokine sequence, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines inducing immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and fail to detect organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in sitokin storm management, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to control the cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive control for cytokine clouds includes modulation of the immune response to T-cell; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JaK inhibition; blinatumomab; implantation of the cytokine 4 signal; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the risk of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can cause side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which greatly affects prognosis.
However, short-dose corticosteroids are provided at a low dose until they are encouraged to be given with caution in a COVID-19 patient who is critically ill.
At the time of this research, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the gift of remdesivir intravenously, i.e. a nucleotide analogue, was found secretly in a COPID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antivirus drug developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
In recent years, remdesivir has also shown inhibition of RNA virus from another single virus, which includes mers and SARS.
On this basis, Gilead has provided this life for Tigkok to perform a series of tests on the infected SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who have recovered and developed antibodies
There is a long history of patient blood collection that has been healed from a chronic illness to treat another patient suffering from the same disease or to prevent the health of the affected person.
True, patients who have been cured often have a relatively high level of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign substances, recognize the unique molecule on the pathogen, and directly control it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and are administered to 10 patients with severe disease.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, along with lowering the inflammation and the burden of virus and increasing oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification have to be done to recommend this method for the use of a large scale before specific therapy is developed.
Further, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immune response over time and cause cytokine discharge syndrome, which is a potential toxicity to the soul.
Blood antibodies are usually low and plasma is needed in large numbers to treat a patient who is critically ill.
The development and production of specific antibodies is fast enough to combat the global epidemic.
Therefore, more importantly and practically isolate B cells from patients who have been cured and identify genetic codes that deal with effective antibodies or make effective antibodies to proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the level of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tigkok for thousands of years.
However, most effects depend on combinations of components in the formula. This formula varies depending on diagnosis of disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify the component or the optimal combination.
Currently, because there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative therapy for patients with mild symptoms until they are or for those recovering from severe illness.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are available as an excuse for the COVID-19 therapy.
The rate of recovery in COPID-19 patient therapy was observed in several TCM-based provinces in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM only in about 30% of COPID-19 patients, had a mild recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very severe because many other factors, such as the number and severity of the patient, need to be assessed.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends involved a study comparing Western drug therapy (WM) only with WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time needed to restore body temperature, the loss of symptoms, and blind care was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
What's more impressive is the level of symptoms (from light to heavy) much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
Even so, the effectiveness and security of TCM is still waiting for a better-controlled test on a larger scale and at more research centres.
The other interesting thing is to create a working mechanism and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients expected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very afraid of a very deadly disease and even death, and the people who are quarantined also feel tired, lonely, and angry.
Further, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and sedatives and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
At the early stage of SARS, a number of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor geleacs, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicides have been reported.
Exploring the history of contact and quarantine, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 plague, can make people more concerned and feel guilty about the effects of revulsion, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients with COPID-19, those expected, and those who contact them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should cover the design of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine update and accurate about the SARS-CoV-2 plague, and the therapy and use of devices and professional electronic applications to avoid contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to break the transmission chain from animal reserves and humans are infected with slowing stomachs and are often able to complete antiviral therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by the onset of the virus.
Upaya has been designed to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which has long and effective antibodies to neutralize and/or immunity to SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live vaccines have been evaluated on a trial animal.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the age and model of the lethal challenge and its protection against zoonotic virus infection still needs to be determined before clinical studies are started.
This may be because SARS was fired 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, the sporadic case and the Mers cluster continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic region.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using denominative viruses, DNA plasma, virus vector, nanoparticles, particulates like viruses, and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in the animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunists is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is not easy to cope with the long-term development of the vaccine (as an average of 18 months) and the variation of the dynamite coV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just started to show a full clinical trip to thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient is able to heal himself without delay.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, designing a disease forecast model is very important for the health care body to prioritise its service, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors may affect or relate to the predictive of COPID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS forecast, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in a study with 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients who need intensive care tend to have a comorbidity and complications and significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median 66 years compared to 51 years), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for the end of the COVID-19 patient.
The sex type: SARS-COV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Comorbidity and complications: COPID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to have acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
A heart attack also damages the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-COV-2 is also reported to be associated with colangositis with ACE2-positive, which can cause heart function in COPID-19 patients.
It should be noted that basic age and disease are very flawed and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory finding: The C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or net injury and is induced as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
Correlation between the CRP and the breakdown and the COVID-19 forecast has also been suggested.
In addition, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed in very high organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional signs of heart and heart function.
Key clinical symptoms: Photos of chest and development of temporary clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As explained above, steroids are highly used immunosuppressive therapies for infections to reduce the risk of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of this disease eventually suffer from atrial osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short-term exposure in COPID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COPID-19 plague, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to endure long and extreme uncertainties and to witness the death of a family member close to each other.
Psychological advice and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on a demographic study so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiology than SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-COV-2 can efficiently replication in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or without symptoms at the early stages of infection, similar to other coV causing strokes.
Therefore, in the early stages or incubation times, infected patients can produce a large number of viruses during day-to-day activities, which present a major difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-COV transmissions were believed to occur when patients were severely ill and most did not occur at the early stage.
Thus, the COVID-19 plague is much worse and difficult to control than the SARS plague.
At present, a great effort is being made in Tiongkok, which covers the quarantine of Wuhan and the surrounding cities and quarantine runs around the entire population with the hope of breaking down the SARS-COV-2 transmission.
Although this action is very damaging to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has dropped, indicating the epidemics.
The most optimistic estimate is that the plague will end in March and the breeding phase will take place for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems much more expensive than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and said that SARS-COV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
Canada's research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-concest and convulsions of patients who had recovered and returned from the hospital two weeks ago. This indicates that the re-identified virus can be a recurring episode, similar to influenza.
Even so, the signs of promise occur in Tigkok, if seen on the basis of the new case number, which shows that this strategy may now work.
Ebola is again predicted to cause one million deaths as well as half of them.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a non-pathogen virus that can be side-by-side with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-COV-2 is very easy to transmit by means of skeletal or skeletal, and possibly also by contacting directly with substances contaminated by the virus.
This virus was also found at the feces so that it could trigger a new transmission, i.e. the fes-ne-mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which include 17 patients with previous disease and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, careful preventive measures should be taken to protect humans, especially those who provide health care, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who happen to be in contact with patients or those who are infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (the 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Medical masks ensure that the scars of people who have the potential for infection are neither air-tight nor glued to the material surface, where the scars can be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 mask (number 1860s) that can protect against virus inhalation with a small size 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion can fully internalize; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Because particles can internalize even five tumor masks that have been crushed into one, the health care provider that directly contacts the patient has to wear N95 (the 1860s) and not the tumor masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear a suit of fit isolation to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-COV-2 even though he wore a mask N95; the virus might enter his body through eye contact.
Therefore, the health care provider should also wear a face - to - face mask or glasses while working with the patient.
For the general community in affected areas or affected potential, it is highly recommended that each person wash his hands with soap is infected more often than usual, try to stay at home for quarantine, and avoid contact with people who are infected.
The length of three feet is assured to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homologous to SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, it must be a major warning to Tionkok that has a strong memory of the SARS plague in 2003.
Even so, on January 19, 2020, the Director of Wuhan Disease Control calmed the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and that prevention and control of this disease is not a problem.
This message greatly calmed the fear of society, especially when the whole country was preparing the Semi Festival, so that this critical time went by to cope with a small disease in Wuhan.
The disease control body in Tigkok should take lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is observed by the citizens and can change their attitude and decision; (2) more sensitive and responsive to non-clinical information than waiting for official reports from a doctor or authority; (3) more limiting the epidemic potential at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more often to eliminate targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of the disease and to test and increase the public response system periodically.
The COVID-19 plague was caused by a new SARS-COV-2 virus that began to sink at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout Tigkok and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this campaign.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 plague has a similar effect as the SARS plague returns.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to withstand the epidemic and deal with the patient.
COVID-19 is more about age than young people and more about men than women, and the rate of death is also higher in age than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COPID-19 transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit the virus when they are severely ill.
This explains some of the reasons for SARS-COV-2 spreading faster and wider than SARS-COV.
Routine RNA base to check SARS-COV-2 can produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a patient who has been healed may have further positive results in virus testing.
This meeting greatly increased the risk of viral transmission.
As soon as the COVID-19 research has progressed, some important issues still need to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although genetic homologs have been found to be 96% between SARS-COV-2 and two coVs-like SARS-Cov-2 tubes, we still cannot conclude that SARS-COV-2 comes from tubes.
What kind of animal is the middle species to implant the virus from the original, tell the bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we can't break the transmission effectively and the plague can refuel at any time.
Although molecular models and basic biochemicals show that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract and cause further pathological changes?
Does this virus also relate to a cell expressing ACE2 in another organ?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic go on?
How did the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will this panther be a panther around the world, ending like SARS, or going back periodically like flu?
The answers to the above questions and many more are important, but it may take time to find them.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Human crowned zoonotic virus origin
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven co-evolution of the coronary virus (coV) and its membranes, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coVs (HCOVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as dyspnoea.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverse the situation and reveal how highly HPV infections can be damaging and endangering the soul.
The launch of SARS-COV-2 in the center of Tigkok in late 2019 has made the CoV reintroduction and surprise us with high transmissions, but with a lower pathogenity than his brother, SARS-COV.
HPOV infection is zoonotic, which is why the original zoonotic understanding of HCOV will benefit us.
Most of the HCVs come from pelvis, in this animal, no pathogenic virus.
In the middle of some HCV reservoirs has also been known.
Animal identification is directly involved in the prevention of human disease.
A coV-interaction research in animals can also provide an important monitoring of coV pathogens in humans.
In this quest, we provide a general picture of the current knowledge of the seven HCVs, focusing on the history of its host and its zoonotic origin and transmission of its interspecies.
What's important is that we compare and interfere with the HCV from the point of view of evolution and the recombination of genomes.
Epidemi CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the rules for successful genetic alterations and the implications of the virus’s progression to disease disease are also included.
Coronavirus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses wrapped around, positive tingling, and a single victory.
This virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms between the RNA virus called CoV, because its morphology is like a crown under a microscope electron.
Based on its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar landing.
Approximately two thirds of the genome consists of two large open-ended reading sequences (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are intertwined with each other. Both are translatable to polyproteins of the replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein has further processing to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining genome consists of an open-label (ORF) sequence for structural proteins, which includes tonoons or spikes (S), envelopes or envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complete proteins specific to a given offspring are also attributed to a variety of coV offspring.
Depending on the protein sequence, CoV is classified as four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among those four types, the beta-CoV gene has the highest number of HCV and is further divided into four sequences (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that vertebrates and vertebrates are a source of most alpha-COV and beta-COV genes, while the ugarit is a primary reservoir of gamma-COV and delta-COV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross the species barrier and some CoV has become an important pathogen for humans.
So far, there are seven human coVs known.
Among the seven viruses, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-COVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, coronal acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-COV), Central Eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-COV), and SARS-COV-2.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, and HCV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as diarrhoea and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections to be more severe in relatively more patients and have a higher chance to develop into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung.
The first line of HCV-229E, B814, is isolated from a single patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through a thorough study of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, which has both caused a healing of its own.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCV infection is not generally dangerous until the SARS plague occurs.
The SARS plague that took place in 2003 was one of the most devastating plague in modern history, which infected more than 8,000 people with a gross death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East syndrome (MERS) caused a progressive epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula by means of a distributed preaching campaign to other parts of the world.
New HCV 2019 (2019-nCoV), hereinafter called SARS-CoV-2, is a cossatative agent of the epidemic of coronary virus 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm's gone, and the world has to prepare for the coming SARS-COV-2.
The seven HCVs all have zoonotic origins from vertebrates, rats, or pets.
A lot of evidence supports the evolution of all the HCVs from the vertebrae. In the vertebrae, the coV is well-introduced and nonpathogenic, but shows a great genetic suspicion.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created a huge medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge for Tigkok and the whole world.
Studying the original HCOV zoonotic system provides a working class to understand the natural history, the ability to move, and the limitation factor of movement among species.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for animal reserves, intermediates, and amplifying SARS-CoV-2, which has an important involvement in the prevention of coming time.
In this research, we gave a general picture of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCV pathogens.
We specifically monitor and discuss the general topic that the HCOV virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but became pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to new vessels.
We also noted the HCOV evolution train that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by pathogenicity clearance.
The outcome of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first strain of HCV-229E, B814 strains of patients suffering from angina, various coVs have been isolated from infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In a few last generations, seven HCVs have been identified.
The short history of HCV detection in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first line of HCV-229E is isolated from the patient's respiratory tract that had an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which is further adapted to be formed in the wi-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCV-229E show symptoms that include headaches, dizziness, leukaemia, and convulsions, including fever and dizziness seen on 10~20% of cases.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the body culture and the sequences of sequences in the brain that were still straining.
The clinical description of HCV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCV-229E, which cannot be automatically distinguished from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 spread throughout the world and the most widely transmitted trend during the winter season in the area is under way.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by illness for about two weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCV-229E have experienced mild strokes.
Just a little patient with a weak body failure system that shows lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is a pandex of the first HPV documented well in human history and its etiology agent is SARS-COV, which is the third HCV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tigkok.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 deaths reported in 774 deaths, widespread in many countries and continents.
Apart from the superseller, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with incubation time 4 to 7 days and peak viral load on the 10th day of illness.
Patients first infected with SARS-COV experienced myalgia, headache, fever, leukaemia, and aching, followed by dyspnea, spleen, and breathing disorders as symptoms of further levels.
Lymphopenia, abnormal heart function tests, and increases in kinase creatine are a laboratory’s fault with SARS.
Alveolar infusion, epithelium proliferation, and macrophages increase were also observed in patients with SARS.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal, heart, and kidney can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokines, which can kill, especially in patients who are weak.
The virus was first isolated from lung biopsy opened to zero-patient relatives traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, the effort has been tremendously dedicated to HPV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from children aged 7 months from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus is initially very sensitive to young children, the elderly, and the frail patient who suffers from respiratory disease.
The corrosives, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolytis are found on the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation of the male child's native specimen 8 months old who suffers pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, the virus has actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of the public respiratory disease and its peaks occurred early in the summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is related to obstructive laryngitis, which is also referred to as crude.
In the same year, HCV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had previously been treated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiitis, HCV-HKU1 is reported related to acute asthma exacerbations.
Similar to HCV-NL63, HCV-229E, and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
The four HCV communities have all adapted to human beings and generally have a small chance of mutating into a very pathogen disease, however, the extraordinary case is certainly due to unknown reasons, as in the case of a more virulent HPV-NL63 subtype that has recently been reported due to a severe lower respiratory tract infection in Tigkok.
In general, when the ability to move efficiently and maintain self-defence in humans, virulence and pathogenity of the HCV also decreased.
MERS-COV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old lung patient who had acute pneumonia and failed to kidney in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratories come from the Middle East, the import case has been reported in several European and Tunisian countries for a period of time.
The second secondary wave took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS clinical manifestations are similar to SARS clinical manifestations, which are identified by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MRS patients have also experienced acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs on MRS among the diseases caused by HCV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases have been reported with high-case deaths of 34.4 per cent, making MERS-COV one of the most feared viruses known by humans.
In the mid- to the end of December 2019, the pneumonia patient cluster, which is retrospectively related to SARS-CoV-2 infections, was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tigkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the underlying respiratory tract infection plague is ongoing and caused by SARS-COV-2 as a Global Health Treatment and named it COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the death rate of 3.4% severe cases.
It has to be recorded, the case death in Hubei, the Tingkok, about 4.2%, while the case death outside Hubei is about 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes a severe respiratory infection such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV with a picture of the tail, sneezing, and breathing.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly as an acute respiratory disorder.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar to high nucleotide homologies, 82%, both grouped into different phylogenetic branches.
Sars-CoV-2 pathogenisity is clearly lower, but more likely than SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
SARS-COV-2 infected subjects have been reported without symptoms and may play a role in the rapid preaching of SARS-COV-2 worldwide.
Compared and distinguished SARS-COV-2 with six other HCVs show very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation and duration of HCV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-COV-2 follows the general six other HCV trains.
Second, the COVID-19 barrier lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCV communities (e.g. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, and HCV-NL63).
On one side, SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a more general picture of the HCV community infection, which includes a non-specific symptom image of light or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small part of the COVID-19 case can look like SARS-COV infection, even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also showed interesting patterns, having a mix with both the HCV community and the SARS-CoV.
On one side, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCV community.
On the other hand, none of the transmission capabilities of SARS-COV-2 after several human routes still need to be verified, like the SARS-COV and MERS-COV case.
Last, just like any other HCV, SARS-COV-2 can be detected from the faeces sample.
"Does the SARS-COV-2 transmissions play an important role, as in the case of the SARS-COV transmission, at least in certain situations, it still needs to be explained by the next study."
What's also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is a seasonal character like in the case of the HCV community.
Anyway, the image of SARS-COV-2, which includes the ability to transmit, the pathogenicity, and the preaching of progress in a number of human lines, will have a profound impact on the fate of the end of the COVID-19 wave that is taking place.
Four HCV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCVs.
In other words, both HCV and humans may be the vector species of the HCOV pantheon in the past.
The HCV that causes severe diseases in humans and in humans with severe HCV disease has been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCV must be replicated in humans in an appropriate amount to allow adaptive mutation accumulation to fight the factor of agile elimination.
Thus, the longer the SARS-COV-2 plague persists and the more infected people, the greater the likelihood of this virus being fully adapted to human beings.
If the virus is properly adapted, the transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
For years, the four CoV communities have gone into the human population and have been triggering violence against people with immunocompetence.
This virus does not need an animal reserve.
On the other hand, SARS-COV and MERS-COV that are highly pathogenic have not yet been adapted to humans and their transmissions in humans cannot be defended.
Both need to defend themselves and make repairs in zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread to people who are vulnerable, possibly through one or more of the means and amplifications.
SARS-COV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCV communities.
SARS-COV-2 is very easily transmitted as a community of HCV, at least now.
However, SARS-COV-2 is more pathogenic than the HCV community and not a septogeneic SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It still needs to be observed whether SARS-COV-2 will adapt fully to humans and circulate in humans without animal reserves or intermediates.
Before discussing the origin of HCV animals, we need to discuss definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and HPV amplification.
Animals act as HCV evolutionary dragons if they have a close-rooted ancestor and share high homologies at nucleotide sequences.
The ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this gland.
In the same way, the amount of time that you spend in a tank carries HCOV on a perforated basis and in a chronic age.
In these two cases, the mucous membrane is naturally infected and is the natural membrane for HCV or the invertebrate virus.
On the other hand, if the new HCV enters the middle of the brain just before or about the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not been adapted to the new brain and is often pathogenic.
The mean can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplification agent by allowing the virus to reproduce temporarily, then transmit it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCOV may have a bloated infection if it can't maintain transmission in the middle.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt to interdependence and even cause long - term endemicness.
In this regard, the average person in the container is the same as the average person in the tank.
Epidemiological data retrospectively reveal that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with hunting animals.
A study of seroprevalence further indicates that the animal vendor has a higher IgG prevalence of anti-SARS-COV compared to the general population.
The moonworms and dogs in the animal market are the first to be identified with a similar SARS-COV virus that is almost identical to SARS-COV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the banks in the market were killed.
In this case, it is reported that the moon of wild or farmed animals that are not exposed to the animal market in most of the animals provides a negative test for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the moon's moon may only act as an amplification of the mean, but not a natural resource for SARS-CoV.
It has to be noted, because 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be counterbalanced that maybe many small mammals also function as the reason for the amplifying of the SARS-CoV.
It all looks like it's the end of SARS-COV.
A natural animal search for SARS-CoV further revealed a nearby coV tunnel, known as the Rhinolopus bridge of HKU3 relatives (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Tignkok yard.
This valve provides positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and sequence through SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This coV and the other coV valves share the homologous sequence of nucleotide 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study became the foundation for a new concept that the pelvis is good for a new human pathogen.
Some coVs like-SARS (SL-COV) were also identified from the tunnel, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is a known SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from the faeces sample is shown using ACE2 valves, valves, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
What's interesting is that the SARS covalesen patient serum can control the WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most laborious ancestor close to SARS-COV in the basement, with a 95 percent nucleotide homology.
Apart from the high homolog between these two viruses, it's generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct induction virus of SARS-COV and a non-reservative of SARS-COV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-COV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-COV use the same yellow receptor, called peptidease 4 (DPP4), as a virus entry path.
The sequence of polymerase RNA depends on the Mers-CoV RNA in a phylogenetic way, closer to the edge of the beta-CoV channel identified by Europe and Africa.
So far, there's no MERS-Cov alive found in the wild cages.
MERS-COV and close relatives of CoV-HKU25 are only sharing 87% of the nucleotide sequence homologies.
That's why it's probably not the Mers-CoV tank.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab ovaries produce seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize Mers-CoV, just like those of the Middle East in some African countries.
The mers-cov life identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from an Arab nasal strain, which further indicates that the mers-cov is a real reservoir for mers-cov.
It's also important to note that massive virus discharges with symptoms that are usually mildly observed on test eggs infected with MERS-CoV.
It has to be noted, the eggs that are infected require not only the virus through the respiratory route, but also the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral transmission from the jaw.
Even so, the question is still not answered because many MRS cases confirmed do not have a history of contacts with ostrichs before symptoms are revealed, possibly as a result of human-human transmissions or a route of transmission unknown that involves unknown animal species that carries MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homologies with CoV ratG13 insulated from Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the SARS-COV and MERS-COV case, the difference between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is too big to establish incest.
In other words, the pelvic may not be the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, except if the pelvic coV is almost identical found in later days.
It's possible that the animals between SARS-CoV-2 are one of the wild mammals sold and killed in the Great Ocean Food Market.
Some recent studies based on metagenological sequences show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as manis javanica, may also bring an excruciating beta-coV with SARS-CoV-2.
This new coV gene divides 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the coV is as close to the RATG13 as 90% in the nucleotide sequence.
Both were grouped into two subgenital viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which is more like a receptor binding domain (RBD) similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino sequence of 97.4%.
The same thing, RBD SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 are even more different, although the homologous levels are consistent throughout the higher.
A previous study on a disease-disease also reported the detection of contig virus from a lung sample, which was also found to be working with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a different method of recovery and thought manually to produce a sequence of partial genomes consisting of about 86.3% complete virus.
We can't afford to break up as one of the animals between SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence that supports SARS-COV-2 comes directly from a collision because the difference between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2 calls.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2.
The SARS-COV-2 evolutionary pathways in the ear, the crack, and the other breast must still be fixed.
Although the highest homologation in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 interlocking, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest homologation at the highest level of the entire genome.
It's too speculative if it says that the height of friction between RBD beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2 breaks and SARS-COV-2 is driven by the convergence evolution that is mediated by the selectivity.
Comparative hypothesis supports the recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 strains and RATG13 in third wild species.
As an evolutionary factor, many recombination occurs between beta-coV.
Researchers still can't decide about the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV, the zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63, and HCV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E may be derived from cov cleavage, while HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 induction viruses have been found in rodents.
ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American three-coloured gate shows a mortality close to HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E genetically worked with another coV tube, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also expected to be among its roots.
To make it more clear, the current knowledge of the origin of HCV animals known in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the transmission of HPV interspecies in history.
In about 1890, when HCV-OC43 crossed animal species to infect humans, it was recorded as a respiratory infection.
The history of HCV-229E transmissions is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV wires that work with HCV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there's alpha-coV alpha.
Some evidence supports the transmission of viruses directly from the jaws to humans.
First, humans, not the alpha, who may be in contact with the echoes in the ecological relay together.
On the contrary, humans have a close relationship with the alpha.
Second, the alpha-coV channel that works with HCV-229E has a variety of types and nonpathogenics in the tube, while alpha-coV causes respiratory disorder in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coV alpha was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpha-coV relatives of HCV-229E from humans cannot be taken for granted.
In fact, it is a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
That's why, it's not surprising that the wires may directly transmit HCV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while alpha-coV pelvis functions as a HCV-229E lung, alpha and arabic may function as an average of transmitting viruses to humans, just like the Mers-CoV case.
MERS-COV is a very good example for transmitting interspecies from the rivers to the Arab and from Arab to the human.
The origin of the evolutionary MERS-Cov of the vertebrae is known for the early identification of the virus and is also reinforced with the discovery after it.
It is clear that pelvis is a lung of the rich virus species for the exchange of the genetic fraction of the interspecies and the transmission of interspecies.
A long age, a well-suited colony, a close social interaction, and a strong flying ability, all are a condition that supports the deaf to become an ideal 'viral preacher'.
On the other hand, Mers-Cov has been in Arabic for decades.
This virus has been adapted to the veins that have changed from the inside to the stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-COV causes a very light disease and protects relatively low mutations in this animal.
Its transmission to humans happens by chance and humans remain proud of the end of the Mers-CoV because its transmission cannot be disrupted.
It's not like an engagement role in the Mers-CoV transmission, an interruption role, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
Especially, beta-coV-intercepts are highly pathogenic in interfering.
Calling may be the end of the beta-CoV relatives SARS-CoV-2, similar to the suspension in the SARS-CoV case.
In incoming studies, some possibilities of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be counted or side-by-side.
First of all, the pelvis could be a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 related virus, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological relays with the glaucoma by means of healing or rough stone mining.
Second, cutting could be one of the intermediate amplifications for the new SARS-CoV-2 cousin virus.
Humans get viruses through the capture and consumption of fish meat.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, including pets, slow down on SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies to pets and wild animals should be monitored.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that communicate well with the vertebrae or the vertebrae.
The original search for SARS-COV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Apart from the various species of animals, three major factors of the virus side are also important to facilitate the coV overcoming species.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to another single successful RNA virus, the CoV mutation scale estimate can be considered "current" to "high" with the average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year per hit, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to new pulses.
CoV has exoribonuclease fororexion, elimination that causes very high metabolism, attenuation, or even inviolability.
Interestingly, nucleotide analogues Remdesivir is known to suppress coV replication by inhibition of this exoribinuclease and RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-COV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the CoV mutation rate is about a million times higher than that of the corn mutation.
In addition, the change often takes place when CoV hasn't adapted to the wind.
Compared to SARS-COV that has high mutations, SARS-COV-2 mutations are actually lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation with humans.
Probably, SARS-COV-2 has adapted to other worms that work closely with humans.
Except for SARS-COV-2, this also happens on MERS-COV that has adapted to Arab anointing.
Theoretically, there is little chance that genetic suppression will quickly make the vaccine and antivirus agent against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA in the CoV provides additional flexibility in the modification of the genome, for mutation and recombination, so as to increase the probability of co-evolution of the interspecies, which benefits from the emergence of a new coV when appropriate.
This is supported by many unique reading sequences and protein functions at the end of the 3′ genome.
Third, CoV is often turned over randomly during RNA replication through the unique "choice-salin" mechanism.
In coals that function as a compound body, a change in frequency occurs during the transcription of RNA CoV.
A complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNA can be recombined to form a new CoV.
The phylogenetics of natural recombination have been found on HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as on animals such as SL-COV and CoV-HKU9.
Virus-inflammation related to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the virus interaction with the inhaler is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-COV is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection evidence during interspecies transmissions.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and musculoskeletal isolates, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in a variety of glands, especially with mutations on RBD proteins S.
In general, RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptor and intensively becomes the target of an inflammatory antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the amino acid to 318 to 510 on the S1 fragment, which is associated with human ACE2 and its receptor as the path to the virus.
RBD SARS-COV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including ticks, mosquitoes, rats, and rat dogs, so that they can transmit interspecies virus.
In fact, only 6 amino residues observed differ between human virus isolates and suspensions in RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-COV must have K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of tonal protein interaction with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for adapting viruses to humans.
It must be noted that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 protein S unit implies the affinity of protein S binding with ACE2 human potential has changed.
In fact, a Cryo-EM study shows human binding ACE2 affinity and S SARS-COV-10 protein to 20 times higher than human ACE2 affinity and S SARS-COV protein.
What's also important to know is if there's another corridor that might be needed for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are a lot of other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-terasetase asthma for HCV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the resultant adaptation of this coV in humans after transmission of interspecies from its pets.
In addition to cell receptors, the end-of-transmission of HCV interspecies is also organized by the interspecies factors and other constriction factors.
The difference between humans and natural reservoirs, such as eels, Arab eggs, and pets, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HPOV should take over the congenital resistance factor and exchange the congenital degenerative factor in order to achieve interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular sensor in the field of the interaction of these important viruses still needs to be identified and identified.
The whole throughput is unusual to see the influence and limitation factor SARS-CoV-2 using the highest CRISPR technology may be useful.
It's starting with a new HCV: back to the beginning of the plague
The CoV vision of the stars gave us a great opportunity to introduce a new HCV.
In this case, the coV pelvis functions as the HCV gene lung.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCV and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, seizures or loss of new protein implantation potentiates the medification of the phenotype virus dramatically.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in adapting to humans because of the strained SARS-CoV relatives virus found to deal with multiple ORF8 proteins.
SARS-COV with a special feature of the elimination of 29 nucleotide was found on the isolated site at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports incandescent changes.
In addition, SARS-COV may have a recombination history with alpha-COV and gamma-COV descendants, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination of the sequences of descendants was shown on the Mers-CoV epidemic, which took place in the Arab monasteries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombination has also been observed in other HCVs where HCV has been recombined with other coV animals in its non-structural gene.
It should also be noted that making selection can play a role in unintended changes in the viral genome, likely due to virus release from the current selection pressure, such as the immune system.
This effect is a complete loss of ORF4 on the HPV-229E prototype site due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While full ORF4 can be observed on the vertebral and ovary virus that works with HCV-229E, alpha-COV alpha shows a single nucleotide site that causes the order movement.
Finally, new HCV evolutions were also driven by selective pressure in the brain of its reservoirs.
Symptoms light or without symptoms detected when coV is infected, which show each other's adaptation between coV and pelvic.
Looks like the adaptive valves are good with CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, failure to activate the proinflammation response on the liver will effectively lower the pathology of CoV.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cell on the jaws was forced by the application of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer receptor regulation and the level of molecular expression complex of the lower class I histocompatibility.
In addition, the levels of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high metabolic activity of the gland can suppress the coV replication and affect the replication by exoribonuclease so that it gives selective pressure to produce highly pathogenic virus strains when entering the new gland.
A more pathogenic coV strain may also develop through recombination, resulting in new protein alloys or new protein fibers for ingenation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCVs have emerged in the last two generations.
The coV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in the brain of the reservoir, such as hives and ovaries.
CoV replication strongly without triggering a strong immune response.
This is where there's a secret driver without symptoms and the cause of heavy infections on humans.
Symptoms are especially severe due to the activation of excessive immune response and cytokines, with increased lung damage if the immune response gets stronger.
On the other hand, the immune response to the disease has been eliminated from the coV replication.
The same strategy to resolve the immune response relationship may benefit from anti-SARS-COV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong on the jaw.
Therefore, the type I interferon, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection on humans, should be beneficial.
Also, the inflammasom NLRP3 activation in the defective jaw.
For this reason, the inflammasom NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 may benefit from the COVID-19 management.
The Sars-Cov-2 occurrence follows the general occurrence of Sars-Cov and Mers-Cov.
While beta-COV dividers that share 95% nucleotide homologies with SARS-COV have been found, there are also coV dividers that share 96% nucleotide homologies with SARS-COV-2.
Although mosquitoes and other animals in the market were found to have a virus identical to SARS-CoV, no direct diameter for SARS-CoV-2 was found.
Beta-CoV intercepting very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which indicates that the interception may be one of the inter- or beta-CoV intercepting devices may contribute the gene fragment to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was deliberately or unintentionally made by humans.
CoV's back to the center of attention because of the SARS-CoV-2 plague recently.
The coV study in vertebrates and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reserves for HCV on human transmission.
A lot of evidence shows that SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 come from the jaw and are transmitted to humans through the middle wing.
Remember that SARS-COV infection comes from contact between humans and wetlands in the wet market, maybe the closure of the wet market and the murder of all wetlands in it that effectively ends the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the strains should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmissions, in memory of the discovery of some strain lines of beta-CoVs that work closely with SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism are transmitted to humans through a breakup and other mammals still have to be explained in the research in coming days.
On the other hand, Mers-Cov has long been in Arabic.
It functions as an important transport tool and as a primary source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for local communities.
The Arabians spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all the eggs to control MERS, as in the wild animal market in Tigkok to prevent the preaching of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop the mers plague, a comprehensive approach should be made to develop an effective mers-coV vaccine and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we can eliminate this virus, new genotypes can develop and cause damage.
Various zoonotic coVs go wild.
Especially, the coV is very diverse with zoonotic potential.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic coV to evolve and experience recombination, resulting in a new coV that is easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in Tigkok must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 sufferers, better preparation and recovery plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet from time to time.
These viruses are in its natural reservoir until there's a chance to preach.
Although the glaucoma has many characteristics that support the spread of the virus, the human potential for contact with the glaucoma and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Exploratory surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the coV ecology and its nature, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals-humans and the coming plague.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonose virus is for humans to keep the distance from the ecological relaying of the natural reserve of zoonotic viruses.
Some of the original zoonotic parts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
First, if an ex-sars-coV-2 virus is transmitted to a strain, the condition when a strain and a break is shared by an ecology relay is important to know.
Second, if the butterfly has a more direct role in transmitting to humans, the human contact with the butterfly must be determined.
Third, if there's a third breast that acts as an intermarriage, the way it interacts with other species, which includes humans, hearings, and throats must be explained.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets who may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, have a good test infection and surveillance to do.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Research in this field will evaluate the evolution pathway SARS-COV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnosis criteria "expected" and "confirmed" COVID-19 should be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance for the diagnosis and management of new coronary virus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV).
Even so, coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings and practical clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are being updated as well.
In this letter, we responded to one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "provided case" and "confirmed case" based on the Diagnosis and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Tignkok People's Republic.
In December 2019, the new coronary virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused the disease, which is currently formally called the coronary virus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guidance was published online in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
That direction has attracted much attention since its publication.
However, it needs to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and practical clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and control strategies are being updated as well.
For example, the Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the Tigkok People's Republic (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, this commission has released a total of seven editions with a large number of contexts.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., and they introduced a simple score offer based on their clinical experience.
The results of their work added new evidence for our guidance and proved to be valuable references to this worldwide plague.
We supported their meaningful work and expressed our gratitude to Jehovah.
However, the results of their work also need to be updated on the basis of the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Management Guidelines and the latest study.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), a combination of one of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations is expected to be confirmed, or three clinical manifestations are required if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and its surroundings, or another community in the case of COVID-19 has been reported within the last 14 days prior to the trial; (2) a history of contact with the case of the positive case of SARS-CoV-2; (3) a history of contact with a patient suffering from dementia or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and its surrounding region; or another community in the case of COVID-19 has been reported within the last 14 days prior to the trial; (4) a history of contact with the confirmed cluster of the case (≥ 2 cases of the patient and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a small area, such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 citric acid count; (3) total white blood cell count shows normal lymphocyte count, down, or decreases at the early stage.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) the real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full sequence of the virus shows high homogeneity for the newly known coronavirus; (3) the positive for the specific IgM antibody and the IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or the modification of the IgG-specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibody from the negative to the positive, or the titer increased ≥4 at the recovery phase above the level at the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR tests nucleate in the breathing or blood supply sample are added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples was added in the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the research of the evolution of researchers to find the optimal nucleate asthma detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of the respiratory tract including blood collection, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the release of certain positive antibody results into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence that reminds us of a patient with atypical symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s river basins should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be checked in practice and in clinical studies at an early stage.
As a cover, we hope that more direct evidence will appear and ask readers to comment.
For diagnosis of "expected" and "confirmed" cases, we recommend that we follow and follow the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also occasionally update our guidance as help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day due to that virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of cases of infection recorded including 114 cases of active substance and 33 cases of house healing.
Total 17 deaths.
In a news campaign, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death involves four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two sacrifices came from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was visited by the Kuwaiti Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video announcement, the Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obidul Quadr said that public transport would be stopped longer than redesigned until Saturday came.
This public transport stop has begun since March 26th and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4th.
Transporting wood supplies -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8th, on two new arrivals from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of infections of the SARS-CoV-2 corona virus exceeds one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths are related to COVID-19, a disease caused by a coronary virus.
The summit took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infection and Zambia suffered its first related coronary virus death.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from coronary virus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,056,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 30 hours of 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of coronary virus have been reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports, which reports data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 deaths in the United States were caused by coronary virus infections.
Throughout the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Moscow mayor, extended the area quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians would remain paid without having to go to work by April 30th.
The Portuguese parliament has taken the voice to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the voice was taken out with 215 supported voices, ten abstinences, and one rejected voice.
Saudi Arabia extended the hours of night in the holy cities of Mecca and Madinah until the full day; before that, it was only 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to apply nighttime between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended the residence order until May 1.
Stores in Australia lower the purchase limit of toilet tissue per transaction
On Sundays and Saturdays afternoons, Australia Woolworth and Coles's network of stores each lower the purchase limit of toilet tissue to two and one p.m. per transaction in all stores at national level.
ALDI also applied the limit of one set, on Monday.
It is announced as a message on the Internet and on the Facebook page.
The receivers are reported to be preparing for the fear of COVID-19 if the society has to do an insulating service.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet tissue for shipments to the house up to one parcel per shipment.
This change followed four orders for transactions previously applied by Woolworths and Colleges each on 4 and 5 March.
In his media statement on March 8th, Coles reported that with the ban on the four packages, "many stores have been running out in an hour since the shipment," and mentioned the request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".
The sale of "stamp up" last week, according to one of the lawyers who spoke Woolworths.
Costco shop in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two weeks ago.
To avoid arriving, Coles ordered a bigger package than the cook and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made preparations for the special hair promotion activities earlier available.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Perittel Association, said that the peritel was trying to increase the supply, but the local government's restrictions on the time of the truck delivery made it difficult.
He's expecting to pay the cost of production, while the cook's trying to meet the demands, and less special promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since the preparation had been made earlier, some shops could not hold special rabbis.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retel expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills the preparation every night.
He stresses that toilet tissue is a large amount of stuff that is so low in supply and, if it's sold, makes a lot of empty space in the racks so that things are getting worse.
Coles and Woolworths think [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet and catering can [purchase] and there's a lot of panic, maybe it can be minimized, Russel Zimmerman weather through the ABC News Office.
Who Gives a Crap's gold toilet producer said last Wednesday that they're out of preparation.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Uncle Kleinex's toilet, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, forced them to work 24/7 to keep the market, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real state site, reports that some property vendors offer free toilet tissue to the first lawn mower in Melbourne, when less grass is held because the buyer took the yacht to get rid of the rest of the week.
The magazine NT News, a newspaper published in Darwin, highlights eight websites that are meant to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
Shops are totally refusing to apply the limit, according to the ABC Australia report on 3 March, they say that they do not plan to apply the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, pens, dry food, hand soap, and soap.
Similarly, on Sunday afternoon, Britain’s Okado supermarket was observed to limit the purchase of Andres’s toilet to two decks of 12 pcs.
World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemi
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the COVID-19 plague is happening—the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to the extent to which the disease has spread, not to how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All the countries still have the ability to change their route.
If a country detects, tests, manages, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, it is known as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO.
We are very well aware of the level of our preaching and preaching activity and of the concerns we face as well as of the degree of apathy we face.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases, this "has never happened before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "except influenza, there is no respiratory tract virus that has ever been traced from its onset to global preaching that is moving forward."
Ghebreyesus expressed the same view, saying, "We have never seen a panda that was pimped by a coronavirus."
He went on, "and we've never seen a panda that can be controlled at the same time."
A new pandemi status follows WHO's decision in January that spells this plague as an association of society's ills that dominate the world.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "in his case, this plague will be worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandemium coronavirus 2019-2020 is a pandem disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) which is continuing and caused by coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The plague was identified at Wuhan, Tigkok, in December 2019, as a World Health Organization Resolution on 30 January 2020, and as a hostage on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have been healed.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in Tigkok, while the world's empire starts from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
It's common to have a demon, a stone, and every breath.
Complications can involve pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time has passed since the birth of the birth of the birth of Jesus Christ, but it can begin from two to fourteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific antiviral treatments.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Preventive action recommended involves washing hands, closing the mouth when it is broken, keeping away from others, and watching and standing in isolation for those expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantine, nighttime, workplace hazard management, and the closure of facilities.
This pandemic has led to major global economic disturbances, neglect or restriction of cultural, political, religious, social, social, and commercial activities.
Schools and universities have been well closed at national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
The lack of information on this virus has been reported by the net and there are an incident of xenophobia and discrimination against the Tinghoa people, people with East and Southeast Asian descent and appearances, and people from areas with a significant virus case.
As a result of travel bans and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions down.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok (jubei province ibukota), report that the pneumonia cluster was not known for the reason on December 31, 2019, and that research was carried out in early January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Sea Food Market and therefore the virus is expected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the plague is called SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has just been found and worked with the coronavirus convulsive, the coronavirus calling, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms then came to be known to be sick on December 1, 2019, and the person has no clear connection with the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the early cases cluster reported in December 2019, two-thirds of those were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was probably the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tigkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside Tigkok has exceeded the number of new cases in Tigkok for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with mild symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with 19-year-olds below making up 2.4% of the world's population.
The case refers to the number of people tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive in accordance with official protocols.
By March 23rd, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A research published on 16 March found that in Tigkok, until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30, estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than the case reported.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Disease concluded that the figure could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For those who are not healed, the time from symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with a total of 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, by February 5, about 80% of death occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had a previous health disorder, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official death estimates due to the COVID-19 generally refer to people who died giving a positive test for COVID according to official protocol.
The actual number of fatalities caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, since the official number may not distinguish those who died without testing, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the count of official COVID deaths with a factor of 4-5 fold.
A female juror for the U.S. Control Centre and Disease Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths reported] is lower than the actual number," a statement reinforced by the non-intelligible report about the U.S. calculations too low. A too low calculation often occurs in the pandemic, such as the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside the village was held on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was held in France on 14 February.
By February 28, more than a hundred deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and territorial areas have reported death, on every continent except Antarctica, and in general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This number varies from region to region and from time to time, and is affected by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the first plague, and the character of the population such as age, the type of accident, and the whole health.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the cause of death to the global case is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) on 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the area.
In Tigkok, the ratio of death to fall from 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) was 0.7% (for people with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Another estimate includes the number of fatalities in the case (CFR), reflecting the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities (IFR), reflecting the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are unbounded and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for a certain population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimated the number of fatalities for pandemics as a whole between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The limit on this estimate is determined by the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzes the impact of the investigation on the CFR estimate.
WHO stressed that this pandemic could be controlled.
The peak and end of this plague is unclear and may vary according to the location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University said, "Without control, the plague usually rises and then begins to fall when the disease is gone.
But it's almost impossible to make a reasonable project at this point about when it's happening."
Senior medical advisor to the Tiongkok Zhong Nahshan government believes that "this plague may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, possibly for one or two years."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical discharges and other steps will be required "until the vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear completely" and this disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Relapse virulence will depend on the group's integrity and the level of mutation.
CoVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and those infected can be without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and it is dry (68%).
The symptoms that are less common include fatigue, the production of respiratory spasms (flamma), loss of breath, breathing, sleepiness and muscle, headache, headache, dizziness, vomiting, haemoptics, diarrhoea, or psychosis. WHO states that about one in six people is severely ill and has difficulty breathing.
U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces emergency symptoms involving breathing difficulties, tight chest or chest stiffness, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and swelling in the face and lips; medical attention is advised immediately if these symptoms occur. Further disease can become severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm infection, therefore, the researchers suggest that those who are close to those confirmed infected should be closely monitored and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimate that the asymmetrical ratio is going from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (when between infections and symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, at least 5 days. For example, the number of COVID-19 sufferers who lose their first 30%, and then fall to 15%.
Indication of how the disease spreads is still under investigation.
The COVID-19 preaching is mainly ensured at close contact time and through small droplets produced when sneezing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that uncovered stone can cause the droplet to move 4.5 feet (15 m) to 8.2. feet (27 m).
Some researchers estimate that viruses may also be triggered by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when talking.
The droplet can fall into the mouth or the nose of a person who's close to it or perhaps fall into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can turn the respiratory secretion into an aerosol and spread over the air.
Preaching can also happen when someone touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, then touches the eyes, the nose, and the mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through pheasants, the risk is low.
The Tionkok government suggested the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a fecal-oral manner.The virus was most active in the first three days after the first symptoms, although the preaching may take place before signs of sight and at a later stage of illness.
People gave positive test results up to three days before symptoms were evaluated, indicating transmissions may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few laboratory-confirmed asymmetrical cases have been reported, but the asymmetrical findings have been identified by some countries in the investigation of contact releases.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) said that although it is not clear how easy this disease is to spread, one general person infected two to three others, and this virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and a hard steel 304, one day on the card, and more than four hours on the copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and humidity of the animal and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can develop viruses to humans, although the British authorities suggest that they wash hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have touched the infected person.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia-related patients associated with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the coronavirus in the natural world. Outside of the human body, this virus can be destroyed if you hit the home soap, which makes up its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely working with SARS-CoV at first.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus is genetically classed with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (the offspring B) along with two gene gaits.
This virus has 96% equivalent at the whole level through the other coronavirus sample (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Tionghoa researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the sequence between the calligraphy virus and the human virus.
So far, the whole comparison by finding the most common genetics is 92% of the same genetics between the coronavirus called and the SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the call is the cause of the SARS-CoV-2.
The virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is finally done through a reverse polymerase transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to the infected secret or to the CT transcription.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many features that are resistant to pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT can't be used as a first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO published some RNA test protocols for SARS-COV-2, first released on January 17.
Test using real-time (rRT-PCR) polymerase response.
Tests can be performed on a sample of breathing or of blood.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is carried out on a nasopharyngal strain, but it can also be used by a number of laboratories and companies developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these serological tests proved accurate enough to be widely accepted.
In the U.S., serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by the laboratory certified.
The characteristics of the radiographic and composite tomography features (CT) on people who are symptomatically involved in background glass opacity peripheral asymmetry and no pleural rash.
Italian Radiological Society is manipulating the international network database to find the enumeration in the confirmed case.
Because the hostage with other infections such as adenovirus, the unconfirmed PCR has limited specificity in the COVID-19 identification.
A major study in Tingkok compares breast CT results to PCR and shows that although less specific for infection, rhinitis is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as an instrument of epidemiology.
The neural convolution network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to detect the features of the virus in the radiography and CT.
A strategy to prevent this disease involves keeping a good personal cleaning comprehensive, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing a cloth when it is dirty or dirty and immediately throwing a tissue into the trash.
A person who may have been infected is recommended to wear a drug mask in public places.
It is recommended that the laws of the land and the laws of the land and the laws of the land and the laws of the land should be observed.
However, the virus has reached the extent of the population’s preaching activity in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of society don't know where or how they're infected.
The use of location data from the phone by the government for this purpose has triggered a privacy issue, with statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance limitation.
Various cellular applications have been implemented or recommended for voluntary use, and on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups work on a private interview solution, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of the user's cell phone.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're close to someone who's tested positive for COVID-19. Only misunderstandings about how to prevent infection; for example, chewing the nose and tearing with the cure is not effective.
There's no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing hands is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least two and a half seconds, especially after washing from the toilet or when their hands are dirty; before eating; and after washing their nose, ankle, or soak.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by a house soap that destroyed its protective layer.
Further, CDC recommends the use of hand-based alcohol management with alcohol content at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encouraged people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of channels (in one minute of the paparazzi infected for the hard core surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other routes, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are not effective.
CDC recommends that if there is expected or confirmed COVID case in public facilities, such as office or childcare facilities, all areas such as office, bathroom, public areas, electronic devices together such as tablets, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by the sufferer should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with chewed silk or tissue when it is sneezing or sneezing, and then immediately discard the tissue.
Various masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because using masks can limit the volume and short range of explosive droplets spread while talking, squeezing, and squeezing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner of masking.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch the face with the hands that are not clean enough, which is a major source of recovery."The mask is also recommended to be used by people who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who suffer from COPID-19, although WHO also admits that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
A number of countries have begun to push the use of masks for members of society.
In the US, CDC recommendes the use of a non-medicine face mask made of cloth. Kicks specifically recommend the use of medical masks are used to a healthy society, especially when approaching (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing masks when using public transportation or living in large areas.
Thailand’s health officials encouraged people to make linen masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited the public from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government urged everyone to enter the castle to wear a mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear a mask when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has commissioned train passengers and interstate buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama obliges the use of face masks every time outside the house, and recommends making your face masks for those who can't buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social limitation (also called physical limitation) is an act of infection control that is meant to slow down the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social limitation methods include quarantine; travel limitation; and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or financial centers.
People can apply the social limitation method by staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using uninvited greetings, and caring for the physical range of others.
At present, many governments are obliged to or precipitate social exclusion in the affected areas.
Maximum numbers of people gathered to be recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations are rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if there is no COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned meetings in the public area involving more than two people. Lansia and people with basic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune systems with a higher risk of serious disease and complications recommended by the CDC to be more likely only in the home area of the affected population. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health professionals began to use the term "social sealing" as a "physical printing", to clarify that its purpose was to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relationships, either virtually or from far away.
The use of the term "social networking" has the effect that people must be completely socially isolated and does not encourage people to stay in touch with others by alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This recommendation includes an incentive to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Isolation in the house is recommended for those diagnosed with COPID-19 and those expected to be infected.
Many governments are obliged to or recommend quarantine for the entire population living in the affected area.
The quarantine instructions are the most strictly issued for people who include high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to the COVID-19 sufferings and those who have recently gone to the country or territory with the wide-ranging COVID-19 preaching recommended to perform quarantine for 14 days since the possibility of the last siege.
The strategy of evil control is rebellion, oppression, and slander.
Guided at the early stage and aimed at tracking and insulating infected people and taking other steps to control infections and vaccinations aimed at stopping the spread of disease to the whole population.
When it is no longer possible to stop the spread of the disease, try to continue to shift to a mild degree: these steps are taken to slow down the spread of the disease and reduce its impact on the health and public health systems.
The combination of adhesion and adhesion can be done at the same time.
The suppression needs more extreme steps to reverse the pancreas by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the control of mental illness is an effort to lower the epidemiological peaks, known as the spread of the epidemiological curves.
This lowers the risk of obesity in health care and gives more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical intervention to deal with the plague involves individual prevention, such as hand cleaning, wearing face masks, and quarantine; steps at the level of society intended for physical limitation, such as closing schools and canceling mass meetings; social engagement to stimulate reception and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also apply various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced local mass abusers and quarantiners, and it issued warnings about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who make quarantine stand and wear large dentures for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan enhances the production of facial masks and penalises medical preparations. Simulation for England and the United States shows that mysticism (lately but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and depression (returning to epidemic growth) has a major challenge.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce the demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and poor health systems.
The suppression can be selected, but it needs to be maintained while the virus is still leaving the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first available), because if not, the recovery will be re-launched as soon as the removal steps are completed.
Long-term intervention to push the pandemium has a social and economic impact.
There's no specific antivirus drug approved for COVID-19, but the development effort is being made, which covers the existing drug testing.
Consuming flu drugs sold free, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the level of depression, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the patient’s condition.
Some of the deaths previously approved for the treatment of other virus diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and domestic services" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO said that increasing the capacity and adopting health services for the patient's need for COVID-19 is a basic step in response to the illness.
ECDC and the WHO regional European offices have issued guidelines for primary health care and hospital services to divert resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services for the COVID-19 testing, if it allows to cancel the electrical procedures, separate and isolate positive COPID-19 patients, and improve intensive care capacity by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and sleeping places.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called a zero patient).
The first known case of a new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, Tigkok.
In a month, the number of coronary viruses in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Atlantic Food Market, which also sell animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these species; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia cluster with unknown causes was observed on December 26 and was handled by Zhang Jixian at Hubei's Hospital, which informed the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27th.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Center of Wuhan Hospital told their friend about the "sars-like coronavirus".
Eight of this doctor, including Li Wenliang, was warned by the police because of the spread of fake disasters, and others, Ai Fen, were advised by him for the warning he was issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then released an announcement to the public on December 31 and informed WHO.
A large number of pneumonia cases are not known to be reported to health authorities in Wuhan, who then began research at the beginning of January. In the early stages, the number of cases increases twice every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of Tignkok, supported by migration during the New Year's Imlek and because Wuhan was the transport centre and the main railway station.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States has exceeded Tiongkok and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have been healed.

Director General WHO Tedros Adhanom said that PHIIC was stated because there is "a global risk of preaching, especially to low-performing and middle-aged countries that have not yet had a promising health system.

Furthermore, Ryan said that this data currently does not allow the public health office to report global pandemics, and says that such a declaration means "we basically accept that every human being on this planet will spread the virus."

Director General WHO says that WHO "is very concerned about the level of preaching and the concern for unemployment, as well as the level of the fearsome nature of action."

Some commentators believe that this step is meant to protect the secretary-general of the Communist Party Tiongkok Xi Jinping from the public anger of the coronavirus plague.
Several Tigkok officers, such as Zhao Lijian, refused prior confession of the early coronavirus plague in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theory about COVID-19 came from the US or Italy.
The U.S. Governor Donald Trump referred to coronavirus as "Tionkok virus" or " Wuhan virus" and said that "Tionkok's cover-up action gave power to the virus that is now becoming a global pandemic."

The Daily Beast received a message from the U.S. government that analyzed the communication strategy and clearly came from the National Security Council, with a strategy described as "All about Tionkok.

The source charges Russia with a "geopolitical and diplomatic" attack.
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo ignored the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo ships with medical assistance to the United States.

On 14 March 2020, President Iran Hassan Rouhani wrote to world leaders to ask for help and said that his country had difficulty fighting the plague because it lacked access to the international market as a result of United States sanctions on Iran. This plague has prompted a call to the United States to adopt general social policies in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, family benefits, and higher levels of education for public health.
Political analysis suggests that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's ability to re-elect in the 2020 presidential election.

Coronavirus plague is dependent on the lack of supply, which comes from an increase in the use of equipment globally to fight the plague, the purchase of panic, and the disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Drug and Food Authority issued a warning about the lack of drugs and medical devices because it increased consumer demand and consumer interference.
Some areas also suffer from a panic that causes the need for trees, such as food, toilets, and bottled water, which causes a lack of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the transmission of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the request for a protective device increased by 100 times.
This request led to an increase in the price of up to 20 times the normal price and resulted in a four - to - six - month sale of medical supplies.
This has also led to a worldwide lack of self-protection, and the WHO warned that this would endanger health.
In Australia, pandemi provided new opportunities for daiguou to sell Australia’s products in Tigkok.
This activity results in the arrival of milk formulas in some supermarkets and was finally banned by the Australian government. After the prevalence of the COVID-19 case in northern Italy and Wuhan region, and the demand for food, the two areas were prevented from lack of food.
The steps taken by Tigkok and Italy in the fight against kidnapping and illegal trafficking of important products have succeeded so that the lack of acute food expected to occur in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large number of farms, has not yet undergone a census, but prices can be increased according to industrial administration.
Empty food was found only temporarily, even in Wuhan’s city, by the Tiongkok government’s officials to clear the pig’s meat supply to ensure a sufficient level of public health.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which requires food producers to keep a reservation for emergencies like this.
Global economic degradation has been felt in Tigkok: according to the report on 16 March, the economy in Tigkok has been hit in the first two months of 2020 by government steps to prevent the spread of viruses, and sales of the ringworms to 20.5%.
Because Tiankok is the centre of the economy and major manufacturing, the virus plague is considered to pose a major risk of destabilization to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimated that the market would keep moving until there was a clearer picture of the potential of the end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the economic fall from the epidemic on global growth could exceed the SARS plague in 2002-2004.
An estimate by experts at the University of Washington, St. Louis, said the plague affected more than $300 billion on the world market, which can last for up to two years.
Country Export Organization Earth Oils (OPEC) is reported to be "reduced" after the oil price has been severed as a result of a reduction in Tigkok's demand.
On February 24th, the global stock market fell due to significant compliance with the number of COVID-19 cases outside the country's Tiongkok.
On February 27, because of his increased concern about the coronavirus plague, a number of U.S. stock indexes covering NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the latest census since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest census of one day since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
The three indexes closed the week with more than 10% pollination.
On February 28th, Scope Ratings GmbH stressed the credit levels of the Tiongkok government, but defended Outlook Negative.
The amount of anchovy again because of the concerns of the coronavirus, the largest discharge occurs on 16 March.
Many people think that economic recovery might happen.
Economics Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency steps of the central bank and the state of the region at the right time.
The central bank reacts faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst sectors of travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist sites, and government actions that limit travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights because of little demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Quantas, while British Flybe regional companies fell.
The impact on the shipping industry is at a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and railway stations have also been closed.
The epidemic is close to Chunyun, the main journey season related to the New Year's holiday.
A number of events involving many people have been cancelled by the central and district governments, including the New Year's Imlek Festival, and private companies have also been able to close the shops and tourism sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many of the New Year’s events and the closed tourist resorts to prevent mass meetings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional temple exhibition.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, cities, and Tigkok districts, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10 and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until that date.
This area is a producer of 80% of the country's PDB and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased disease management to the highest level and announced emergency situations, closed school to Maret, and cancelled the New Year's Festival. The Rite sector is affected globally by the temporary hours or closures.
Visits to Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
North and Central American explorers have a 50-60% census.
It's also due to a 33-43% census, then a foot-and-mouth trip to the shopping mall in March compared to February.
Operators of the world's financial centre take additional steps, such as increased sanitation, the installation of the browsers to check the buyer's temperature, and the closure of the event. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the resections caused by the pandemic can increase the number of people in extreme poverty in Latin America from 14 to 22 million people compared to the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, some 5 million people in Tigkok lost their jobs.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus plague may cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the rate of unemployment may reach 32%. In India, the quarantine region has caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages). Survey of Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have suffered some kind of job losses. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they had quarantined the region in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, a total of 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers submitted a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted short-term work schemes to the government for its officials, called Kurzbek.
The German short-term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Throughout the world, the art and cultural heritage sector is affected by the pandemi, which affects the operation of the organization and individuals, both employed and present.
The arts and culture sector is trying to support their high mission (often publicly owned) to give cultural heritage access to society, to the security of workers and society, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, across the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, venues, and other cultural institutions were closed without time, with exhibitions, events, and demonstrations cancelled or staged.
In response, intensive efforts are made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, resulting in the loss of another recent disease and very rapid development is the removal of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, as well as violent entertainment.
The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy City in Rome, which ended in the last week of the Christian Passover, was canceled.
Many groups encourage the Christian age to live at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, direct radio or television, while others offer drive-in or uplifting services.
With the closing of the church and the chapel of the Roman Catholic Church and the emptying of the Holy Peter’s field of Christian ministers, other religious bodies also canceled the service and restricted public meetings at the church, church, synagogue, temple, and temple.
And the people of the city said, “The people of the city are the people of the city, and the people of the city are the people of the city, and the people of the city are not on their way.”
It has caused the most significant disturbance to the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events were cancelled or banned, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, the 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 season NBA, and the 2019-2020 season NHL.
This plague disrupts the 2020 Summer Olympic Plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will "be scheduled again by 2020, but will not be longer than the summer of 2021."In the world, the casinos and other playgrounds are closed and the poker tournaments are broadcast directly or cancelled.
This has caused many gamblers to move to a network, many online gambling sites to report significant increases in the number of new entrants, and the entertainment industry has been affected, with various music groups lagging behind or canceling a concert tour.
A lot of big theaters like Broadway also delay all the shows.
The artist explores various ways to continue to produce and share works through the internet as an alternative to the traditional direct display, such as a direct broadcast concert or making a "festival" web-based for artists to view, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many of the Internet’s themes of coronavirus are spread out with many people who turn to humor and turn their attention in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the suspicion of the COVID-19 plague, there has been an increase in discrimination, xenophobia, and racism against the Tinghoa and East Asian descendants, and against people from the affected regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
An incident of fear, suspicion, and hatred is seen in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
A report from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in Tigkok) recorded racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that Tighoa deserved to receive the virus or accept what they claim to be a similar reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-Tyongkok sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei people report discrimination because of their region.
There's already support for Tinghoa people, both chains and scars, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the development of the plague to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to suffer from the serious COVID-19 plague, can also be a target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea at first sign a petition to ban Tionghoa from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag is a train on Twitter.
Tinghoa and others in the United States and the United States reported an increase in the rate of racial and attack relief.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling coronavirus "Tiongkok Virus", a term that was considered racist and anti-Tiongkok by critics.
The Ukrainian feelers attacked buses that took Ukrainians and foreigners who were evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, bordering with Tigkok, and learning in large cities of India were reported to experience a related coronary virus plague.
The president of Bharatiya Janata's party, the state party of the West Bank Dilip Ghosh, said that Tiongkok had destroyed the universe and "that is why God revenged them."
The statement was then threatened by the Tugkok Consulate in Calcutta, by calling it "kluru".In Tugkok, xenophobia and racism against non-Tionghoa people are expelled because of the plague, with foreigners being described as "foreign" and targeted for "refoulement".
Many newspapers that use paychecks have removed them for some or all of their coronaviruses.
Many scientific scholars make available open access to the subject of the plague.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on a work server, such as bioRxiv.

The discovery of wild insects and zoonoses - health risks related to trade in exotic wildlife
Laboratory testing for coronal respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and virus SARS-CoV-2 included a method that detects the presence of virus and detects antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect RNA SARS-CoV-2 alone.
This test is used to confirm new infections or still active.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used to diagnose and monitor populations.
An antibiotic test shows the number of people who have been infected, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report, or those who have no symptoms.
The mortality rate of the exact disease and the level of mortality in the population can be determined from this test.
Due to limited testing, by March 2020, no country has any data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests that countries have made.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of fatalities reported, which are likely to be too high in some countries.
Using a real-time (rRT-PCR) polymerase response chain, this test can be performed on breathing samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngal surges or spout samples.
In general, results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests carried out on the throttle strain can only be carried out in the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to reproduce in the lungs.
As an alternative, for those who are infected on the second week, sample materials can be taken from the breathstream by using a catheter or a material released through the fungus (sputum) to be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time polymerase transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 testing tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
British Raya also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korea's Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 authentication device based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) that ranks on 28 January 2020.
This device seeks the "E" gene that contains all beta coronaviruses, and RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In Tigkok, BGI Group is one of the first company to receive emergency consent from the National Medical Products Administration Tigkok for PCR-CoV-2-based authentication devices. In the United States, the Control and Disease Prevention Centre (CDC) has distributed the RT-PCR Real-Time Koronavirus Panel to the public health laboratory through the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test apparatus provides unconvincing results due to reaction errors, and the number of tests on the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed during February 2020.
Tests using two components are considered unrestricted until 28 February 2020, and only after that is the part country laboratory and the local laboratory allowed to perform the tests.
This test was approved by the United States Medical and Food Supervisory Board on the basis of the Emergency Use Authority. The US Commercial Laboratory began its testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made a COVID-19 test available nationally on 9 March 2020.
There are no quantification limits announced; the collection and processing of specifics should be done according to the CDC specification.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Center of State Research on Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Care Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop tests to detect COPID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that can be performed within 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation (U.S.) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA previously issued the same authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also accepted the US from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using isothermal isomermal nuclear amplifying technology that is not PCR.
Since there is no need for a series of temperature shift cycles, this method can only produce positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Now there are about 18,000 machines in the US and Abbott are looking forward to increasing production to 50,000 tests per day, testing using monoclonal antibodies specifically related to nucleocapside proteins (protein N) of the new coronavirus being developed in Taiwan, hoping to produce results within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza testing.
A library research published in March 2020 concluded that "the thoracic photo has a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while finding CT [computed tomography] may already exist prior to symptoms. "
Special features of CT include multi-lobar background-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura dominance, paving crazy, and consolidation are formed in the development of disease.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the original pandemium point currently shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with a lot of puncture features with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used for setup or as the first line test in the COVID-19 diagnosis."In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for initial alignment.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections on individuals since about 7 days after symptoms examination, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance. Checks can be done at the central laboratory (CLT) or with a point-of-care (PCT) test.
The system automatically with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this check, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLTs, generally one peripheral blood specimen is used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, in general, one peripheral blood specimen is used that was obtained through a skin clot.
Unlike PCR methods, extraction steps are not required prior to the check. On 26 March 2020, the FDA listed 29 agencies that provide notices to agencies as required and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe's approval for their test tools that detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in the blood sample.
Its test capacity up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR checks on RNA virus.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after the outbreak of infection, and early April, Raya discovered that none of the antibodies that she bought were good enough for use.
Hong Kong plans a schedule to allow the patient to stay at home, "the emergency ward will provide the patient with a special tube," they slammed into it, sent it back, and obtained the results of the test some time later. NHS England announces that NHS is pioneering the case test scheme expected at home to eliminate the risk of patients falling into another person's home if they come to the hospital or have an ambulance infection if used. In an emergency trial for the case suspected of COVID-19, a professional health officer will take samples of appropriate prevention measures.
At 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance German physicists said that Germany had about 12,000 tests per day in road maintenance and 10,700 tests had been carried out last week.
The cost is borne by health insurance if a medical examination is requested.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a series of tests were presented in several large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, overall, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Hospital Technion and Rambam developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by merging samples and testing only further if a positive combination sample was found. In Wuhan, the laboratory's emergency verification laboratory is estimated to be 2,000 metres long (in Mandarin: ↔, or "Api" in Indonesian) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction monitored by BGI Wang Jian's side and ate for 5 days, the model showed that the Hubei case could be 47% higher and the cost related to quarantine management could be doubled if this test capacity was not available.
Wuhan's laboratory was immediately followed by the Hua-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout Tigkok.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. The design of the open source multiples by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 checks. The design of this balance can be run in a small laboratory without the need for robotic irrigation.
Until March, the lack and lack of sufficient reagents have become a challenge for mass testing in the European Union, the UK, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers have tried to explore the sampling protocol involving sampling at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the DNA for further testing. On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates was reported to perform more coronavirus tests per capita of the population compared to any country, and is preparing to increase the testing scale to reach a large majority of the population.
This is achieved by a combination of an up-to-date test and the purchase of a massive-scale laboratory of population sizes from Group 42 and BGI (based on an emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" in Tigkok).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory that has this scale out of Tionkok.
A variety of test recipes designed for various coronavirus genetic profiles were developed in Tigkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German recipes for the production of test tools sent to low-power countries without the capacity to develop themselves.
German recipes were published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until January 28 to delay the testing available in the United States. At the beginning of the plague, Tigkok and the United States faced a problem with test tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the other hand, experts say that the availability of extensive testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of new coronaviruses.
The test capacity, most of it in the private sector lab, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the testing program as the best way to delay the increase in the COVID-19. High demand for testing because of the widespread virus spread caused hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for operations at the US private laboratory, and the supply of weapons and chemical reactions became critical.
In March 2020, Tíongkok reported on the aqueducts on their test apparatus.
In the United States, the test tools developed by CDC have "defected"; the government then removed the bureaucracy barrier that prevented the testing by the public. Spain purchased test tools from the Shenzkok Shenzhen BioEasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may result from failure to collect samples or to use test tools correctly.
The Spanish Mint said that they would attract the wrong produce, and replace it with other testing tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeacy.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from Tungkok produced false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from Tungkok that were not accurate.
Prime Minister Matovic recommended that this test device be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of Turkey's Mental Health said that Turkey's test equipment from Tungkok had "high error rates" and they didn't "use it". The English government purchased 3.5 million test tools from Tungkok, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test device could not be used.
Tests, followed by quarantined people who tested positive and tracking people who contacted positive people SARS-CoV-2, produced positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vo Italia, the first death site due to COVID-19 in Italy, did two rounds of tests on the entire population of 3,400 people, with a range of about 10 days.
About half of those who tested positive have no symptoms, and all the cases found in the quarantine.
With the restriction of travel to this community, new infections were not at all carried out.
With aggressive contact tracking, travel banning, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has evolved much slower than other developed countries without extreme restrictions, such as the closure of the restaurant and the diesel company.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore recommended that people stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened at the right time after the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics by tracking aggressive contacts, restriction of entry, testing, and quarantine, but with non-aggressive quarantine, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower number of fatalities, perhaps because these countries are more able to detect people who have mild symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity, and national labs with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive samples first COVID-19 and ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America, and 1 are in Australia.
In the following instance, the "positive test result" column was influenced by the country's policy of testing.
The country that only tests those who are hospitalized will have % positive results higher than the country that tested all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, as well as other factors.
Washing hands, which is also mentioned by hand cleaning, is an act of cleaning someone's hands to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Wash your hands with soap consistently at a certain "critical time" all day long preventing many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which have been developed through the faecal-oral route.
People may also experience respiratory disease, such as influenza or stroke, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouth (that is, facial membranes).
Five critical times throughout the day that is very important to wash hands with soap are: before and after a large drop of water, after cleaning the child’s ass or changing the popcorn, before washing the child, before eating and after and after preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or garlic.
If there is no water and soap, hands can be cleaned with gray. World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after treatment for the sick.
After changing the pans or cleaning the children who had just used the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, lips, or lipstick.
After touching animals, food, or dirt.
Medical hygiene claims that medical procedures are involved in the practice of cleaning.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for the public.
Washing hands has a lot of health benefits, including minimizing influenza, coronary virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality rate at home.
A study carried out in 2013 showed that the practical increase in the hands of the female child can slightly increase the growth rate.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children due to respiratory and respiratory disease can be reduced by identifying simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diuretics to about the same size; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in a low-performing area.
48% of cases of diuretics can be related to washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diuretics and acute respiratory infections (ISPAs), as a subconscious behavior performed at home, in school, and in society all over the world.
Pneumonia, the main ISPA, is the cause of the death of a female child; it causes the death of about 1.8 million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets as a first-time habit can save more lives from any vaccine or medical action, and reduce death by almost half and death by acute respiratory infection by one quarter.
Wash hands are usually combined with other sanitary activities as part of the water, sanitation, and cleaning program (WASH).
Wash your hands and protect yourself from the impetigo caused by physical contact directly.
A small side effect of washing hands is handwashing that often causes skin damage due to skin relief.
A study carried out in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive washing of hands can lead to smoldering skin conditions, known as hand rash or hand dermatitis, which are particularly common among health officials.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
There are five critical times throughout the day when washing your hands with soap is important for reducing the flow of the disease in the faecal-oral way: before and after using the toilet (small water, large water), after cleaning the child's ass (skinning the pop), before and before and/after preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or raw meat.
Another important time to apply the technique of washing hands properly for the prevention of disease is before and after the treatment of the disease; after brushing, sneezing, or brushing the nose; after touching the animal’s dirt or handling the animal; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of the households used to wash hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi has the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was almost at 77 percent; and a drop at the lowest level of 23 percent. Now some behavioral methodologies are available to improve the usual adoption of handswashing with soap at a critical time. Washing group hands for students at a time determined is one of the options in developing countries to wash hands in child behavior.
The basic health care program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the right time to take steps to support the health and education of children.
Two times a year, handwashed with soap and toothpaste every day with fluoride, is the essence of this national program.
The program was also implemented in Indonesia.
The treatment of microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by addition of soap or detachment to water.
The main task of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to running and to increase the power of running.
Only water is an inefficient skin cleaning due to fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, is not easy in the water.
In this way, fat and protein are helped by a sufficient flow of water.
Fat soap, which may be re-used, may contain the bacteria that have been found in previous use.
A small number of studies that study the removal of bacteria from thick soap contaminated conclude that the removal cannot occur because the bacteria are contaminated with rubber.
Even so, the CDC continues to say, "The liquid that is released from the fabric without touching the hands more like it."
Anti-baker soap is greatly encouraged to a society that is conscious of health.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or infections that are recommended is better for an antibiotic-resistant organism in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent, such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant strains of the organism.
So even though the resistant strain of antibiotics is not targeted by antibacterial soap, this soap may not be effective based on it.
In addition to surfactants and skin protections, high formulations can contain asthma (ascetics, ascorbates, lactates) as pH adjustment, asthma benzoate as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioner (faeces, vitamins, mentols, and growth extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Health at the University of Oregon shows that common soap is as effective as the antibacterial soap that contains triclosing in the prevention of disease and cleansing of bacteria from the hand.
Hot water is comfortable to wash hands not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot water is more efficient than cold water is in the removal of natural oil that holds up dirt and bacteria.
However, with the confidence of many, scientific studies show that hot water use has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Manual or antiseptic surveillance is a waterless cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand cleaning agents used non-water-based alcohol (also called alcohol-based hand-washing, antiseptic hand-washing, or hand navigation) began to be known.
Most of this cleaning agent is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is formulated together with anti-cancers such as Carbomer (acrylate ash polymer) into gel or with humectan such as glycerin into liquid or Bus to be easy to use and to reduce the dehydration effect of alcohol.
The addition of peroxide hydrogen to the enzyme enhances antimicrobial activity further. Manual management containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient male killer.
Alcohol management kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and snakes.
Alcohol management that contains 70% of alcohol kills 99.97% (log release 3.5, similar to 35 decibels) bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after dressing and 99.99% to 99.999% (log release 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after dressing.
Alcohol-based hand science is almost completely ineffective with norovirus type (or Norwalk), the most common cause of oral gastroenteritis. Antiseptic or alcohol-suppression in the amount of alcohol should be used to wash or to cover two hands completely.
The front and back parts of the two hands and on the back and on the back and the end of all the fingers are burned about 30 seconds to the liquid, boob, or dry gel.
And the edge of the finger should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing it in two hands. The Control and Prevention Center of the U.S. Disease recommends that the hands should be washed over with the hands, especially when the hands are dirty.
Increased use of the pendulum agent because of the ease of use and quick killing of the microorganism; however, the pendulum agent should not be used as a substitute for the right hand wash, unless soap and water are not available.
The use of hand-based alcohol management can often lead to dry skin, unless the emolin and/or the progenitor is added to the formula.
The effects of reducing alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and/or other emolin to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand-based alcohol - containing surgery results in irritation and skin weakness far lower than soap and antimicrobial disorders.
Dermatitis allergic contact, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive in the hand-washing of alcohol rarely occurs.
A lower trend has led to contact dermatitis that interferes with the attractiveness of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clean their hands from organic substances, but only disinfect them.
Because of this, soap and water are not effective in preventing many pathogens.
Alcohol - free research depends heavily on its materials and formulations, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol abuse.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have proven to have a continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after clothing, not like alcohol, which has proven to be diminished after repeated use, possibly due to a progressive side effect.
Many in the community have been unable to buy soap and use it as a substitute for wheat or land.
Abu or land may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is that if contaminated with micro-organisms, soil or gray may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, gray is also a disinfectant agent because, if you contact water, gray will form the alkaline chain.
WHO recommends gray and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Technique washes the right hands based on the recommendation of the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent disease recurrence include the following steps:
With warm, cold water.
Water flows to recommend the presence of a bacon, which may be contaminated, while water temperatures seem to be ineffective.
Put your hand around it with a lot of soap, including the back of your hand, on your fingernails, and under your thighs.
soap raised from the skin, and the study showed that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using only water.
Gosok for at least 20 seconds.
Burning creates shocks, which help to remove the foam from the skin, and burning longer removes more gums.
The water flowes gently under the water.
Counting in the pool can make your hands contaminated again.
Swallow it with a dry sheet or let it cool in the air.
It's a wet hand, and it's easier to recontaminate it.
The built-in coarse coarse coarse coarse coarse stick can keep microorganisms.
The lotion is often recommended to ensure that the hands do not shrink; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection.
The low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands when the water is not available and/or soap is not available. For example, draw water from a well or a bottle hanging over and use it as a grey, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water is limited (as in a developing country or as in a developing country), there are water-stained solutions such as "typy-tap", and other low-cost options.
The tippy dish is a simple technology that uses a bottle of water that is tied to a rope, a rope that is operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a piece of soap.
Effective handshake is an important part of the hand cleaning process, but there is a debate about the form of the most effective handshake in the public toilet.
More research shows that the paper sheet is much cleaner than the electric hand washing machine found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and by the European paper sheet industry Tissae Symposium, comparing the cleaning rate of the paper sheet, the heating of the air hand, and the air hand washing of the more modern jet.
After washing and shaking hands with hot air coolers, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by 194% in the fingerbooks and 254% in the outpouring of the hands.
Motivating with jet air cooler causes the total number of bacteria to rise by 42% in the fingerbooks and 15% in the palm of the hand.
After washing and shaking hands with paper sheet, the total number of bacteria decreases by 76% in the fingerbooks and 77% in the hands. Scientists also do tests to determine the potential for cross-contamination on other toilet users and toilet environments as a result of each type of mitigation method.
The jet air controller, which discharges the air from the unit at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of spraying micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially pollutes other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 metres.
The use of hot - air hand cleaners spread microorganisms to 0.25 meters from the miner.
In 2005, the study by TÜV Product and the Environment carried out a number of methods of hand-lining.
After hand relief, changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand washing machines, and the hand washing machine has been compared to a pencil using a paper sheet.
Washing your hands using the hand pendant tissue is an alternative during the journey if there is no soap and water.
The alcohol-based handwriting must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical washers were required long after the physicist Hungaria Ignaz Semmelweis found their effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital.
There is an electronic device that provides a back cover to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection fell with the use of the device.
Medical handwashing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in large numbers or gels to moisten and soften each part of the hand.
Hands should be burned together with the fingers tied together.
If there's dirt under the foot, the hair can be used to disappear.
Because the man can survive in the water in his hand, the hands need to be washed thoroughly and the hands are washed clean.
After drying, the paper sheet is used to turn off the water (and open the door out if necessary).
This action avoids hand recontamination from that surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care is to eliminate the microorganism pathogen ("human") and avoid its predators.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that at least wash your hands still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash your hands before touching the patient so that it can trigger microorganisms.
One study showed that washing the right hands and other simple procedures could lower the blood flow rate of the catheter to 66 percent.
The manual on cleaning the hands of WHO can also be seen on its website for public comments.
A significant conclusion was reached by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand cleaning if compliance with the rules is required.
World Health Organization has "Lima Time" to wash hands:
after exposure to blood/dry body
before aseptic task, and
After patient treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (including "medicines" or "antimicrobials") functions to kill the handwashed substances.
The killer function may be desired before doing the disease or in a situation where the antibiotic's holding organism is very sensitive. For the hand to be burned before the surgery, it is necessary that the aqueduct can be detected and killed without touching, chlorhexidine or iodium wash, sterile sheet to wash hands after washing, and sterile ink to wipe and other sterile tools to clean the base of the knife.
All the jewels have to be released.
This procedure indicated the washing of hands and hands down to the jaws, usually between 2 and 6 minutes.
It is not a long time to burn (10 minutes).
When it boils, the water in the lower arm must be shaken so that it does not flow back into the hand.
After the washing of the hands, the hands were washed with sterile clothes and the clothes were worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or to use the manual before and after treatment with the patient.
To control Staphylococous infections in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit was cleaning the hands from the first 20% washing, and that the extra benefit obtained was very little when the hand cleaning rate increased by 35%.
Washing with soap usually causes more than three folds of infectious disease to food compared to wash with antibacterial soap. The comparison between rubbing hands with alcohol-based treatment and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds shows that wiper of alcohol-based hands reduces the contamination of bacteria 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand-washing alcohol to reduce influenza A H1N1 and Clostridium spores difficult than hand. Intervention to increase hand-washing in health care care can involve education for staff on hand-washing, increased availability of hand-washing alcohol, and written reminders as well as literature on staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic cost - effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, at least some water supply, soap, or toilet facilities in the homes, schools, and workplaces make it a challenge to achieve a universally owned lifestyle.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, handwashing near private toilets or public toilets is rarely available, although options are available to create cheap toilets.
In any case, a lower level of washing of hands can also be caused by the habits that have been planted rather than by the lack of soap or water.
Moving and washing hands with soap can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and bring about changes in the behavior of the long - term population.
To walk effectively, monitoring and evaluation are needed.
A systematic conclusion to 70 studies found that an effective community-based approach in improving the washing of hands in LMIC, while the social labelling campaign was less effective. One example of washing hands in school is "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF, which stimulates school to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other cleaning conditions.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one star to three stars eventually.
Building a toilet can be part of a hand washing campaign to reduce the disease and death of children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that try to achieve the goal of changing behavior. As a result of the coronary virus 2019-2020, UNICEF encourages handwashing.
Some studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of washing hands in the entire country as a result of disability-adjusted life year (DALY) or the loss of a year due to illness.
One study showed that promoting soap-washing is significantly more expensive in exchange for water interventions and other sanitation.
It's important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in a state of emergency, such as a newborn mother or a wounded soldier in a hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hand-cleaning stages: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who works in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "modern care" in England.
At that time, many people still believe that infection is caused by the smells of weeds or bad air.
In the 1980s, the plague caused by food and infection related to health care made the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases more active as an important way to prevent infection.
In 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, increasing awareness in many countries will be important to wash your hands with soap to protect yourself from these infectious diseases.
For example, the "right hand washing" posters are hung next to the washbasin in the public toilet and in the office and airport toilets in Germany.
The expression "cleaning hands of" means something that tells a person's willingness to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
That expression comes from the cover of the Bible book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands over the decision to include Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began washing her hands continually to clean up imaginary nodes; her actions showed her guilt for the crime she committed and for having seduced her husband to do so.
It has also been noted that after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate the handwashing tools.
Further, those who were allowed to wash their hands after the meditation had a smaller possibility of being involved in the "cleaning" compensation action, such as volunteering.
The religion orders the washing of hands for the purpose of cleansing and symbolism; the symbolic washing of hands, using water, but without soap to wash their hands, is a ritual part of the washing of hands in many religions, including the faith of Bahá'í, Hindus, the Jews, the lepers, the Christians, and the Wudhu in Islam; and the religion commands the washing of hands to purify themselves, especially after certain acts.
The Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religions obligated the washing of their hands after the use of the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam were required to wash their hands before and after eating.
Hazard management for COVID-19
Hazard control of the workplace for COVID-19 is a safety and health assessment of the workplace for the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Hazard management at the right place of work depends on the place of work and the job, based on the risk assessment of paternity sources, the level of disease degradation in society, and the risk factors for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk employment has a minimum working contact with the public and other employees; for this work, basic infection prevention steps, including washing hands, causing workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics, and cleaning and routinely infected work environments.
Paparaan risk work is covering jobs that require close or frequent contact with people who are unknown or suspected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected because of a decline in the ongoing society or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contacts with the general public, such as at school, working environments with high - population appreciation, and high - volume labelling.
Risk management for this group, besides basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high-efficiency airflow, protection against sensitising, and providing self-protection devices when meeting with COPID-19.
OSHA considers the health and the body room to be the most common of the people known or expected to suffer from COVID-19 high-risk paternity, which increases the risk of paternity very high if workers perform aerosol procedures on, or take or handle specifics of, the people known or expected to suffer COVID-19.
Dangerous management for this worker includes technical control, such as a negative ventilation room, and self - protection devices that are suitable for the job.
The COVID-19 plague can have some effects on the workplace.
The workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear the possibility of paralysis.
In the matter of goods which they are asked for, and in the case of goods which they are required to obtain, there is a change in the course of trade.
Finally, shipments of goods from a highly affected geographical area of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Constipation and plans to prevent infectious diseases can be used to guide protection actions.
The article takes into account the level of risks associated with various workplaces and jobs, including paternity sources, the risk factors arising from domestic and social settings, and the risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The articles also identify the risks involved and the emergency situations that may arise as a result of the disaster.
Sickness and disease management plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the deployment involves reducing the gap between staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, defending business operations, and minimizing the bad effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The level of disease in the business community has been affected by the abuses taken.
Hazard - control surgeons are often used in safety and health at work to group dangerous controls based on their effectiveness.
When the COVID-19 hazard cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last self-protection tool.
Technical control involves insulating workers from the risks related to work without depending on the workers' behavior and can become the most expensive solution to be applied.
Administrative management is changing policies or procedures that require action on the part of employees or employers.
Self - protection tools (APDs) are considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but they can help prevent some of them.
All types of APD must be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, properly installed as is (e.g., the respiratory system), consistently and correctly, checked, treated, and sometimes replaced, if necessary, and then cleaned, and stored correctly or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - risk employment has a minimal contact with the public and other workmates.
Steps of basic infection prevention recommended for all workplaces including frequent washing of hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics includes covering the trunks and sinks, providing nets and trash, preparing work from a distance or working circles with the time of arrival/stage, if necessary, telling workers not to use the tools and equipment of others, and doing cleaning and disinfecting the working environment routinely.
The rapid identification and isolation of individuals who are able to train is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from the fever, the symptoms, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of any other anti-emetic medicine or medication, and that the disease relief policy be flexible so as to allow workers to stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, paparaan risk work is covering jobs that require close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 m) with people who are unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-COV-2 because of the population's downturn around the business location, or because someone has just made an international trip to the location with the extensive COVID-19 downturn.
This group includes employees who have contacts with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high-level audiences, and high-volume retellers. Technical management for this group and high-risk groups cover the installation of high-risk air filter, increase the level of ventilation, install physical barriers such as leaking plastics, and install a drive-thru or stand-up window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups encourage sick workers to stay at home, turn face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, make working rounds with the time of arrival/future, suspend non-essential travel to the premises of the guard, stop-to-holding to-holding premises that are passing the riversidesidesidesideside, develop a flight-to-run communication plan and turn-to-to-run traffic control and control the control and control-to-end the control, control-end the control, control-to-fight-run, control-run, control-run-run-run-run-run-run, control-run-run-run-run-run, control-run-run-run-run-run-run-run-run-run-run-run-run-run on on the on on on on on on on on the-run on the-runs on the-runs on on on on the-runs on on the-runs on on on the-run, turn turn turn-runs on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on the turn turn turn turn turn-a on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on the on on on on on on the loss on the loss on on on on on on on on on on on on on on the loss- the on the on the on on the on the on on on on on on on on the on on on on the on on on on on on on on the on on on the loss- the on- the loss- the loss- the loss on the loss on the loss on the loss on the loss on the loss on the loss on the loss on the loss on the on the on the on the on the on the on the loss on the loss on the loss on the loss- the on the loss on the loss on the loss- the loss on the loss- of the loss on the loss- the loss- the loss on the loss on the loss on the loss- of the loss- of the losss on the losss on the loss- the losss on the loss- of the loss on the losss on the losss on the loss of the loss on the loss-----------------19, and the on the on the on the loss-------- the loss- the loss, and on on the loss- the on on on the loss and on on on the loss, and on the loss and the loss- the loss--- the loss- of the loss- the loss- of the losss and the loss and the loss and the loss- of the loss-of the loss- the loss- of the losss and on the loss- of the loss- of the loss and on the loss and the loss- of the loss- of hold on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on whether whether of the loss and on whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether whether or or or or or or or or or or or or to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to get- of the loss on the loss and the loss on the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss on the loss and the loss and the loss and on to to to get to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to get- of a what what what what what what what what what what what what to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to get------ the loss- the loss- the loss- the loss- the loss- the hold- the whether of a a a a what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what to, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for, and the or or or or or or or or or or or or the or or or the or the or to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to whether or the or the or or or to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to have or to to to to to to to to to to to make, or the or the or to to to to to to to have for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for
The workers in this risk group rarely need breathing.
If a person falls ill on a plane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick from the other person at 6 feet, pointing out a cabin to take care of the sick, and offering a mask of face to the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a cloth when he sneezing or sneezing.
You cabs should wear a medical handkerchief once when you are caring for sick passengers or touching the body or surface that is potentially contaminated and perhaps another protective device if a sick passenger is suffering from a fever, sneezing, or breathing difficulties.
For commercial voyages, including cruise ships and other passengers, the risk management includes a trip of illness, isolation, and medical attention on board the ship.
Ideally, there is no further medical treatment in the cabin of a person who is isolated. After preaching to the public, for schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in school.
If there is a social gap at the minimum level until now, the social exclusion strategy can be implemented, which includes: cancel field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, voice classes, or food in the cafeteria, increase the distance between tables, time and time-consuming, limit non-essential visits, and use separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high rate of education in the local community, alongside a social exclusion strategy, the length of school closure can be considered. For law enforcement officials who do day-to-day activities, health risks are considered to be lower by the CDC.
The law enforcement officer who has to make contact with the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same guidance as emergency medical techniques, including using appropriate self-protection devices.
If a close contact occurs during arrest, the worker must clean up and disinfect the pockets and tasks before being used again by using a vacuum or ladder cleaning house and following the standard operation procedure to control and discard the former APD and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers that the health and safety of certain bodies are at risk of being high or very high.
The high-risk job includes health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation that is shared with a known patient or is expected to be COVID-19.
This job becomes a very high risk of paternity if workers perform aerosol procedures on, or take or handle specifics of, a patient known or expected to be COVID-19.
The aerosol process involves intubation, stone induction, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and dental examinations, or the collection of invasive specimens.
The work of the living room is highly risky, including those involved in the preparation of bodies of people known or expected to be COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes a very high risk if workers perform an autopsy. Additional technical management for this risk group covers the isolation space for the patient known or expected COVID-19, including when the aerosol performance procedure is performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care centers and in some bodies.
The specimens should be handled with the prevention of Level of Biosafety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to a different waiting room be separated if they are expected to be COVID-19.
In the United States, the N95 - approved or better NIOSH - based face-to-face respiratory system should be used in the context of written and comprehensible breathing protection programs that include conformity tests, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respiratory agent can provide greater protection and improve worker security. WHO does not recommend covered clothes or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not cured by body fluids.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for a screening officer at the point of entry.
For people who take respiratory specimens, care, or carry a COVID-19 patient without aerosol delivery procedure, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses, or facial scarf, clothing, and gloves.
If the aerosol generator procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Remember that the APD market is not enough around the world, the WHO recommends minimizing the APD's needs through long-range medical services, physical vessels such as the visual window, with only people involved in direct treatment can enter the room with COPID-19, use only the APD required for specific tasks, continue using the same respirator without allowing it to treat many patients with the same diagnosis, monitor and ordinate the APD market chain, and do not induce the use of masks for people without symptoms.

SUGGESTION: [Covid-19] Lighten the burden and prepare the future
YEAR BORN: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes the global human relationship and the responsibility we have for each other clear.
We've never had a challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, work, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we have witnessed among all our workmates through e-mails, calls, and conversations is an extraordinary validation there are extraordinary people, whom we are lucky enough to work with them.
Thank you and my indescribable pride can call you a workmate.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of what it means for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this important resource to remain available to everyone.
Your work enables this to happen, whether you make sure this site keeps running, helps pay our fellow, or helps to maintain our community's security.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, especially at this time.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, it will make a difference to the world.
Because the important thing is this mission and your role in it, we'll make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months coming.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenge and the best way to keep an organization alive during this time.
We are eager to remove the pressure and support our long - term mission.
If you need to reduce the schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our hope for the future is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a holiday, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now, and whether you need to take care of your loved one, shopping for trees, or going to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your work.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should not have to be said, but we did.
Sickness or PTO is not necessary, enough to inform your manager and your team's help review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work can be resolved.
(If you are diagnosed positively suffering COVID-19, please inform Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from the manager).
The employees whose wages are based on hours will be paid in full.
We have said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to fellow contractors and hour-based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours.
This includes if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their employment as a means to cope with the stress of the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Once again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Some work is considered essential.
There's a few jobs to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and the Data Protection Team, among other things, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start a process with all departments to evaluate the current purpose and shift our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential project.
It's getting late right now. It's gonna be okay for the future.
We don't plan on "devoting labor" after this pantomime has passed.
You won't be expected to work diligently to meet a time that is not realistic right now.
We realized that the situation had changed and would try to set a new target and timeline if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adapt to new realities and expectations of working hours, we meant to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the Year's 2020-2021.
Our point is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to estimate that employees can prioritise important work, self-care, and loving care while recognizing their needs or wanting to work on schedule less for a few weeks in the future.
The length of this time line has greatly reduced the workload and the current planning pressure throughout the organization.
We'll present our proposals to the House next week and update the delegations and teams in the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Status, Mapping, and Office Cleanup
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based partners might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But, being very worried, we hired an antivirus treatment crew to infect all the surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They use antivirus fluids across the hospital to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
Buildings use their own safety storage protocol to support the safety of their occupants.
We are glad that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all staff members based in the DC.
From the start of last week, our DC office moved to the far - reaching work site, marked by a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our partners at NYC know, we're also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our partners worked far away for the first time.
Our longtime partners have long worked long enough to realize that it may need adjustment and they want to offer you advice:
The duration limit is at least one or two hours.

The SDM Operation Team is looking for web-based ergonomic guidance to support the expansion of the work distributed throughout Yayasan.
Last week, we've been asking all the community funders to cancel the public event that's based on Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO says the pandemic is over.
We have told them that we understand our request for limitation and other limitations that could not possibly complete the agreed conductive activities and that no one will be given the gate because of the delay or re-modification of the target.
This week, we will continue with additional guidance on Wikimania and the regional and other community conferences.
In general, feelings from the entire global community seem to be the result of this interference, but at the same time relieved of the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT is trying to prepare a page at Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT for special staff.
We're going to use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time for each other.
We're in this situation together and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all essential information related to the other COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will keep updating this page and making sure all the information is in one place.
We also try to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have a question about travel, shows, work schedules, or other difficulties, or other matters that may require help, do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with the CRT.
We're here to help provide support and to be connected to the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an e-mail to Bryan Juden, Global SDM International Operations Director.
Do not make any such changes as your secular work or your secular work.
Rather, it is an admission that, at present, our work and responsibilities may need to be adjusted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are steps we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support for our moves, and provide the world with the services they provide.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and create a room for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months ahead.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of Team Leadership (Grand I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is placed on the outer surface of the cell (brained cell) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and users.
ACE2 has an activity that is opposed to angiotensin-II (ACE), by reducing angiotensin-II levels and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as a point of entry into the cell for several coronaviruses.
ACE2 human version is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin 2 vertebrate enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains a spleen placed on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has a M2 domain of terminal-N peptidease and a domain of an amino renal terminal-C transporter.
ACE2 is the protein membrane of a single type I passenger, with an active enzyme domain on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other networks.
The ACE2 extractal domain is separated from the transmambrane domain by another enzyme, known as scheddase, and the next protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is in the majority of organs: ACE2 is placed on the membranes of the most common alveolar cell type II, small-use enterositis, endothelial cells and veins, and the muscles of the pool of arteries in most organs.
MRNA ACE2 is also found in brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stems.
The main function of ACE2 is the ACE balance sheet.
ACE inhibits angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut the amino phenylalanine terminal carboxyl from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hecdrolysis into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break up a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, orange, neurotensin, dimorphine A, and grelin.
ACE2 also arranges the flow of nitrogen carrier membranes of the neutral amino SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 functions as the primary point of entry into the cell for several coronaviruses, which includes HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 protein to spikes or tonal SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with an enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endositosis and the transfer of virus and enzyme into the endosom contained in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires the priming of the S protein by TMPRSS2 protease, which is currently being investigated as potential therapy.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend further ACE and standard ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis research, published on 11 July 2012, found that "the use of an ACE inhibitor causes a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of an ACE inhibitor also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of an ACE inhibitor is also associated with pneumonia-related mortality, although the result is less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is expected to be new therapy for acute lung injury, and seems to increase lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhaACE2 on humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute job interview except for 24 hours of effect.
Some findings indicate that rhaACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to the renin-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitor or disease with angiotensin II in the increased blood circulation. RhaACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'Application COVID-19 is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to support the use of coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contact") that may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications have been developed or developed, which have received official government support in a number of areas and jurisdictions.
Some workflows for building up contacts have been developed.
The problem of privacy is asked, especially with regard to the system based on the geographical location of the application user.
Alternatives that don't get too close to privacy cover the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tiongkok, Tiongkok government, along with Alipay, has distributed applications that allow citizens to check if they have contacted the COVID-19 suffering.
This application is used in more than 200 Tigkok cities. In Singapore, it is used by TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community, written as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launches "StopCorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to track the proportions of people with potential infection and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application is being developed by Communication and Technology and Health.
By 14 April 2020, the application is still awaiting the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application was in the process of further development and would be available for dissemination within a few weeks. Similar applications were planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia means introducing geophencing applications for the diagnosed COVID-19 patient living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positives and may not be effective if the data collected is limited to only a small part of the population.
To overcome concerns about the preaching of the "coronvirus" application that is misleading or dangerous, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add the related coronvirus application to the App Store, which is limited only to the "resm" organization or that has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply a similar limitation.
Private supporters expressed their concern about the involvement of massive surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that limits such surveillance.
This organization has eight requirements for government projects:
surveillance must be "in accordance with law, necessity, and proportionality";
the monitoring and surveillance needs to have a solar eclipse;
use of data must be limited for the purpose of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data shall be protected and proved on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalisation;
each division of data with a third party shall be defined by laws;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of nationals to respond to abuse;
Participation means all my "relevant stakeholders", which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple article means to deal with surveillance problems continually by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating system after no longer required.
Some countries use network-based tracking, not application, to eliminate the need to disable the tracking of applications and capabilities.
In Israel, network tracking was agreed upon.
A network-based solution that has access to the root location data has the potential of a significant privacy problem.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use the central server only for communications (see below).
In South Korea, a non-based application system is used to track contacts.
Instead of using specific applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes data tracking mobile devices and card transaction data, and connects this information to produce notifications through text messages to people who have the potential for infection.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is permitted by wide changes to the privacy laws after the mers in that country has been compromised.
This information is available to the general public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using a system that is broken down and that protects privacy.
By April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been written.
A privacy-protected contact is a concept that has already been mapled, with a large number of research literature beginning in 2013 at least. On 7 April 2020, more than a hundred expert groups work on a private friendship solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the proximity of the user with other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is an attempt to coordinate which has a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol covers the Approaching Protection of the Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called the Contact Event Number, CEN), the Protocol and the Privacy Sensitivity Mechanism for the PACT, and so on.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified has never left the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Media Lab Private Group develops SafePaths, a platform to use a technology that protects privacy when collecting and using location or natural intersection data to track the COVID-19 preaching.
This is based on research from the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in An Epidemic" written in March 2020.Another similar work is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology and was originally built in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without sacrificing the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was set up by groups that had the same basic approach as a highly complex protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is the main aspect of reaching a wide reception.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that manages Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography technologies that protect privacy.
They also publish the specifications of the intellectual technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
the launch of tools to enable government to make official application of Crownvirus tracking that protects privacy
the integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to deal with data collection and surveillance problems continues with the initial distribution of the system through the upgrade of the operating system, and then delete it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Reposition drugs (also called a new purpose, new profile, or a new task on a medicine or a therapeutic change) are the use of drugs that have been approved for new treatment purposes, i.e. for a different medical condition or disease with an initial purpose of drug development.
This route is a scientific research course that is currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Another study included the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfusion of plasma convalescent. SARS-COV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several binder sites.
Analysis of these binder sites can be the basis of an effective antiviral development project for COVID-19 proteins.
Some SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are most important proteases such as papain, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphate.

A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "there is no benefit to be observed".
This drug is designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to medicate the drug to find a life that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 protease.There are criticisms in the scientific community about resource guidance for drug repositioning that is specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO incorporates lopinavir/ritonavir into the trial of International Solidarity.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a cure for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir has antivirus activity in vitro against some philo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is resistance through mutations that can lead to a worse disease and transmission.
Some early trials have shown that remdesivir may have a high genetic potential for resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital Hospital, one for people with disease and one for those with severe disease.
There are three clinical trials taking place for intravenous vitamin C for people treated with IVC and severe COPID-19, i.e. two controlled placebos (Tyongkok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The New York State began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.

Heparin is a low - molecular bottling agent that has been used to treat patients so that the Italian Medical Body can publish guidelines on its use.
A multifaceted study in 300 patients who studied the use of enoxaparin sodium at the prophylaxis and therapeutic doses was published in Italy on 14 April.
Because SARS-COV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention has been focused on providing new treatment targets to approved antivirus drugs and developed for previous diseases, such as MRS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the guidance of the 7th edition.

Some antibiotics identified potentiates as drugs that can be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor IL-6): Agreed by Tigkok.
In addition, testing is also done in Italy and Tigkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaccin COVID-19 is a vaccine of hypothetics against coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine that has completed a clinical trial, there is much effort being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, this causative virus would not be available within a period of less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in the Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The Great Wave spreads around the world in 2020, which resulted in major investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the genome published to develop vaccines that may fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative made a statement in April that what should be observed in the development of vaccines is speed, production capacity, preaching on the scale needed, and global access.
In April, CEPI researchers reported that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during early 2020 to make an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform target that has advanced to Phase I security study, including:
nucleate asthma (DNA and RNA) (phase I development and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
vector virus (phase I bumper and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be planned or planned).
Phase I-II tests are performed by the initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually by randomized, placebo-controlled, and in some locations, determining the most effective dose.
Phase III test usually involves more participants, including control groups, and tests the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 active candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 are not yet in human evaluation (still in "praklinis").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that they were investigating the potential of a molecular booster vaccine that would genetically medify the virus protein to trigger an immune response.

On 2 April 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical School reported a trial of PittCoVacc, a vaccine candidate for COVID-19, on a mouse; they said that "MNA that gave the vaccine subunit S1 SARS-CoV-2 produced a specific antigen-specific reaction that was potent [in mice] that began to appear 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the Department of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a vaccine candidate based on DNA as a potential native outbreak.
By using bacteria, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce non-hazardous-like particles, which can induce immune systems to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
It means that these vaccines can benefit from outside the disease.
Further tests in Australia try to follow 4,170 health - care professionals.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate vaccine clearance using a specific model of COVID-19 animals, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicate the need to take steps to achieve the level of biological safety 3 in the management of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on a non-human animal model.
By 2020, there has been no protection medicine or vaccine for SARS that has proved to be safe and effective for humans.
According to the research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to cure SARS is a priority for the governments and health institutions around the world.
When MERS is a prevalence, the established SARS research can be a useful platform for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA base) that completed phase I clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines are in process, all of which are virus vectors, two adenvirus vectors (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The social media positioning conspiracy theory that claimed viruses behind the COVID-19 has been known before and that the vaccine has been available.
The patents covered by various social media posts refer to patents that exist for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus diseases, such as coronavirus SARS.
b'Penyat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a malignant disease caused by coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
It's common to have a demon, a stone, and every breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle swelling, diarrhoea, arthralgia, loss of pen strength, and stomach pain.
The time has passed since the birth of the birth of the birth of Jesus Christ, but it can begin from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some develop virus pneumonia and failure to control organs.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed, and this virus is mainly spreading interpersonality when close contact occurs, often through small cracks or droplets produced by the bats, scissors, or when talking.
Although produced when breathing, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and do not move to the distance.
People can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is very fast for the first three days after symptoms are evaluated, although the preaching may take place before symptoms occur and after the next stage of the disease. Standard diagnostic method is with the response of the real-time polymerase transcription chain (rRT-PCR) to the nasopharyngeal strain.
The use of masks is promoted to those who are suspected of being infected with the virus and those who care for it.
Recommendation on the use of masks by the public; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommending its use, and others to maintain its use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antivirus treatment specific for COVID-19.
The transmission of local diseases has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO areas.
People infected with the virus may experience symptoms such as flu, such as fever, dizziness, fatigue, and breathing.
The signs of emergency include difficulty in breathing, breathing, or shaking of the chest, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and the face or the lips of despair.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sensitising, convulsions, or convulsions, can be found, but they are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are observed in several percentages.
A few cases in Tiankok initially only with a clinical scan of the chest and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can develop into pneumonia, an organ failure, and death.
It's called incubation time.
Incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can be ruled from two to 14 days.
The report shows that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of a pilot without this phenomenon in the recovery is not yet fully known; however, early evidence shows that they may contribute to the preaching of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is not yet known and are being investigated, with the Control and Prevention Centre for Korean Diseases (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remain undetected during hospital treatment.
The National Health Commission of Tingkok began highlighting the case without symptoms in its case on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of the test.
Sputum and running water can carry the virus on a large scale.
Talking with a louder release more cracks or drops than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered copper could cause the droplets to move up to a height of 4.5 feet (15 m).
Although this virus is usually not produced by air, the United States National Academy of Sciences has shown that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air collectors placed in the hallway outside the room produce a positive sample for RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can turn the respiratory secretion into an aerosol and spread over the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through pheasants, this risk is considered to be low. The virus lasts when people walk; although the preaching may happen before symptoms occur, the risk is low.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) said that although it is not quite clear how easy this disease is to spread, one general person infected two to three others, and this virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/cardus, for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and hard steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies depending on temperature and humidity.
Sabine and detergen are also effective if used properly; soap products decompose the protective layer of the virus, deactivation of the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Another route, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (diabetic infection), is less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, live water samples were taken in the middle of two days after treatment began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day's test.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to acute respiratory disease cluster in Wuhan.
All the features of SARS-COV-2 virus are on the coronavirus that is working in nature.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by a domestic soap, which destroyed its protective membranes.
The lung is the most affected organ by the COVID-19 because the virus accesses the lean cell through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most abundant in the alveolar type II lung cell.
This virus uses a special surface glucoprotein called "spike or tonjolan" to connect to ACE2 and enter the inhaled cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of the infected people who were treated with indigestion in Wuhan, Tigkok, and more frequently on serious diseases.
High cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disturbance during disease development, but acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with a heart ACE2 receptor.
ACE2 receptor is expressed very high in the heart and is involved in the heart function.
Thrombosis (31%) and high venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients with COPD-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Otopsy to people who died because of COPD-19 detected peripheral alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrate containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for the epithelium-inhaled cell expressing ACE2, COPID-19 patients have a severe systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, the T cell that surrounds the GM-CSF pathogens has been shown to be in line with the monosit group that surrounds the IL-6 inflammatory and pulmonary pathology that is severe in the COVID-19 patient.
Lymphotic infiltrates have also been reported on autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
Standard test method is the real-time (rRT-PCR) polymerase response.
This test is usually carried out on a breathing sample obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal wound; however, a nasal wound or a sponge may also be used.
In general, results are available within a few hours to two days.
The blood test can be used, but it takes two samples of blood taken within two weeks to produce a small amount of time.
Tingkok scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus galaxy and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop an independent polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibiotic test (which can detect active infections and if someone has previously been infected) was under development, but it is not yet widely used.
Tiankok’s experience with the test showed that the accuracy was only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidance of the Zhungnan University Hospital at Wuhan suggests a method to detect infections based on clinical imaging and epidemiological risk.
Multilateral background-glass opacities with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and then a lot found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, paving craziness (supply seven-passes with varying alveolar discharge), and consolidation can occur along the path of disease development.
A little data is available on microscopic lactase and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathology finding on the autopsy is:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of pneumonia virus breakdown can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration, and the formation of giant cells is very important
Pneumonia severe: DAD damage with diffused alveolar output.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disease (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the recovery phase: exodus secretion in alveolar and interstitial fibrosis pulmonary
Blood: intravascular coagulase insemination (DIC); leukoerthroplastic reaction
Steps to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding places of mass, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with the tissue when it squeezes or squeezes and recommending the use of the part in the tissue if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene is a suitable hand after being brushed or brushed.
The CDC recommends the use of cover-up of clothing in public places, some of which are limited by people without symptoms. The social exclusion strategy aims to reduce the contact of people infected with many people, by closing schools and jobs, limit travel, and cancel large-scale meetings in public places.
In addition, the direction of the border includes keeping at least six feet [1.8 m] in length or six feet [1.8 m] in length.
There is no known effective cure to prevent COVID-19.Because the vaccine is expected not to exist until the beginning of 2021, the main part of managing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic peaks, known as the "curve settlement".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after washing from the toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating, and after washing their nose, lips, or lipstick.
Further CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand management that contains at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand management is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it's "not active for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a helmet.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs that are affected.
CDC recommends people who suspect they bring viruses to wear a simple face mask.
The extracorporeeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory failure, but the benefits are still under consideration.
Self - cleaning, lifestyle, and eating habits are recommended for increased immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful for people who have mild symptoms at the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission Tignkok have published recommendations to deal with the ill-treatment of COVID-19.
Intensive treatment and lung patients in the United States have recommended treatment from various institutions as a free resource, i.e. IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some of the medical powers recommend parasetamol (astaminophen) as compared to ibuprofen for first use in linen.
Preventive action should be taken to minimise the risk of virus withdrawal, especially in health care when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health-care professionals who treat the COVID-19, CDC recommends placing the person in the Tular-Air Insulation Room (AIIR) other than using standard prevention, contact prevention, and radio prevention activities. CDC provides guidance for the use of self-protection tools (APDs) during the pandemic.
The recommended device is: APD clothes, breathing or facial masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, breathing masks (not facial masks) are better.
The N95 Respirator was approved for industrial screening, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the U.S.
The N95 Respirator is designed to protect from particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned in the label.
If masks are not available, CDC recommends using face protection or, as a last attempt, own masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are very heavy.
The type of breathing support for people who have failed to breathe associated with COVID-19 is being actively investigated for those who are being treated in an open environment, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-voltage duct or a positive air pressure.
It is unknown whether one of these two methods produces the same benefits for those who are ill.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique limits the preaching of aerosol particles compared to a high flow tube.
Many developed countries do not have a hospital bed per suitable captain, which limits the health system's capacity to handle suddenly the number of cases of COVID-19 that are severe enough to require care.
A study in Tingkok found that 5% of intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tigkok, about 30% of the COVID-19 sufferers finally entered the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex than acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurs at COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
A ventilator that is able to perform pressure control mode and high PEEP is required to maximize the transmission of oxygen while at the same time minimising the risk of lung injury and related pneumotorax.
High PEEP may not be available on an old fan.
Research on treatment potential began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take time by 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested have been approved for other uses or have been tested further.
Antiviral drugs can be used to try people with serious diseases.
Volunteers recommended by WHO are also involved in the testing of efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has provided temporary authorization for plasma convalescent as experimental treatment in the case of a person's very or immediately at risk.
Convalesen plasma has not yet been studied in clinical trials to prove the safety and efficacy of this disease.
In February 2020, Tigkok launched a mobile application to deal with this disease.
User is asked to enter their name and ID.
This application can detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so that it can detect the risk potential of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends the presence of quarantine, but also inform local health officials. Data analysis on the phone data, facial identification technology, phone tracking, and artificial intelligence used to track the infected and the people who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security body to track the expected coronavirus phone data.
It was taken to treat quarantine and to protect people who might be in contact with the infected population.
Also, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed telephone location data to the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in a series of studies and prevention of the virus.
Russia uses face-to-face technology to detect quarantiners.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by the phone operator that "40% of the population is still moving places".
The German government did the hackathon at the end of the week 48 hours with more than 42,000 percent.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the preaching of coronavirus.
People may be under stress as a result of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are the perfect storm that threatens mental health and public health."
This disease can take place mildly with little or no symptoms, similar to the respiratory tract disease in general.
Mildness usually occurs within two weeks, while those who suffer from severe illness or criticism may need three to six weeks to heal.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for coovid-19 severe infections based on data from a similar virus, such as SARS and MERS, but data for coovid-19 is still low.
In the worst person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood clotting errors, especially prothrombin time increases, were observed in 6% of COVID-19 patients treated in the liver, while the renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COPID-19 picture show a transaminases increase.
According to the same report, the median time between symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in obese care.
However, the patient transferred to ICU has a median time of seven days between blind care and death.
In a study that examines early cases, the median time starts from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with a full flow of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tigkok, men have a death rate of 2.8%, while women have a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples indicate mucous alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exodus on both lungs.
The cytopathetic changes of the virus were seen on the pneumonia.
The picture is similar to the acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
On 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with an increase in troponin levels or cardiac arrests.
According to the United States March data, 89% of people treated with cancer have a low level of risk, and the availability of medical and social resources in a region can also affect mortality.
The mortality estimates of conditions vary because of the difference in the area, but also because of methodological difficulties.
At least a simple calculation of the number of deaths can result in an excessive number of deaths.
However, the fact that death is the result of a case in the past can mean the number of deaths at this point being counted too low.
Percok is likely to have 1.4 times the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times the risk of intensive care or death is higher than that of non-percoceived.
The Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a clearance of lung capacity from 20% to 30% in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause an intensive after-treatment syndrome.
By March 2020, it is not known if previous infections give effective and long-term immunity to people who are cured of this disease.
Immunization may be obtained, if you look at the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have been reports of a coovid-19 case followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
This case is believed to be a malignant residue infection, not a recurrence infection.
This virus is supposed to be natural and comes from animals, through widespread infections.
Originally unknown, but in December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely caused by human exploitation.
A study on 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed the date of the earliest medical examination is December 1, 2019.
The WHO's official publication reports the most early medical findings on 8 December 2019.
In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region and from time to time, and are affected by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first plague, and the character of population such as age, type of feline, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established an ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for death as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and U07.2 for death as a result of COVID-19 clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the cause of death to the global case is 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies according to the area, and the other measurement includes the number of fatalities in the case (CFR), which represents the percentage of the diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities in the case (IFR), which reflects the percentage of the infected (diagnosis and non-diagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are unbounded and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all those infected make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
In an epidemic in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, this disease was spread through the Karnaval festival, which spreads to young people, causes relatively lower mortality, and probably not all of the deaths of COVID-19 were classified as COVID-19.
Further, the German health system has not been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by a blood donor.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have died of COVID-19.
The effects of the pancreas and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher for men in a study conducted in Tigkok and Italy.
The highest risk to a man is at the age of 50, with a different risk between a man and a new woman not appearing at the age of 90.
In Tigkok, the number of deaths for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reason for this difference is unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be justifiable.
Immunological differences based on the type of sex, the lower prevalence of smoking in women, and the men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected are men and 72% of the people who died because of COVID-19 are men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government did not track the related type of feline infection for COVID-19.
Research shows that viruses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health officials who are of a higher type of female sexuality, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of spreading the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus explains that CO is short for the Crown, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first time the plague was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid reference to a given geographic location (e.g. Tigkok), animal species, or a group of people, marking with an international recommendation to prevent stigmatization. A virus that causes COVID-19 to be given the name of the acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses the "COVID-19 virus" and the "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communication.
Both the disease and the lesion virus are called coronavirus.
At the beginning of the plague in Wuhan, Tigkok, the virus and this disease are called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to the 2015 guidelines to avoid using the location name in the name of disease and virus.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because capacity constraints in the standard packaging chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal sprays and fan components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital really needs the fan caps, and the cook can't give in the time needed, a local company backs up and prints 100 caps that were needed last night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19, conspiracy theory, false information, and information appeared about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly.
People seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, pigs, and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has yet been approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization employed the "Solidarity Trial" to investigate the effects of the four antivirus deaths that have been most promising.
Vaccines are not yet available, but institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies on SARS-COV were used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 used the ACE2 receptor to enter the human cell.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, researchers aim to produce a full virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either inactive or dead, is intended to rapidly trigger the immune response of the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus narrow down the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear asthma vaccine (a DNA vaccine or RNA, a new technique for making vaccines).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies should be tested to find out its safety and reliability. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains non-hazardous genetic codes derived from the virus that causes the disease. An increase in antibodies has been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials taking place in April 2020.
Seven trials try to evaluate the treatment that has been approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The antivirus drug that has been given a new purpose forms most of Tigkok's research, with nine trials of Phase III on remdesivir in some countries with a reporting date at the end of April.
In April 2020, the dynamic research on clinical development for vaccine candidates and COPID-19 medicinal products already exists. Several antivirals that are currently being evaluated for the treatment of COPID-19, including remedesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir were combined with beta interferons.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for remedesivir clearance.
Clinical increases observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, Tigkok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was first examined in Tigkok in February 2020.
However, there is a call for an interview with the researcher.
Korea's health authorities and Tionkok recommend the use of chloroquins.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending the daily dose of one gram, notes that the dose is twice as dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the policy of a doctor who has been treating COPID-19.The 7th edition of the Citrus Code also highlights interferon, ribavirin, or omifenevir to be used against COPID-19.
The initial data indicate that a high dose of ribavirin is needed to inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 decommissioning at low concentrations.Research shows that the early premium for tonal protein by transmembrane 2 protease (TMPRSS2) is very important for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through an interaction with ACE2 receptor.
A study on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has a major limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this treatment without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm complication can occur at the COVID-19 heavy next step.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antisytokin properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission Tigkok after a small study has been completed.
This medicine is undergoing a phase 2 test at national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe disease.
Combined with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify the cytokine storm, this medicine is meant to fight the cytokine storm, which is thought to be the cause of death on some of the most affected.
In 2017, antagonis receptor interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA on the basis of a retrospective case study for the treatment of cytokine refractory steroid release syndrome induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there's no random and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is a cure worthy of CRS.
Transfer the purified antibodies and placed produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it is being considered as a passive non-vaccin immunization method.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
The neutralization of the virus is a mechanism of work expected for passive antibody therapy that can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depends on the antibodies and/or phagositosis, are also possible.
The form of other passive antibody therapy, such as using the monoclonal antibody produced, is being developed.
Convalescent serum production, which is part of the fluid of the patient's blood that has been healed and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronal disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Center of Wuhan's Hospital, who then fell down and died because of the COVID-19 after the outbreak of a condition to preach the virus.
