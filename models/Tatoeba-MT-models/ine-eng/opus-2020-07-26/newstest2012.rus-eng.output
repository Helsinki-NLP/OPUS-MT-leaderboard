Parliament does not support the amendment that gives freedom to Timoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to abolish an article that condemned opposition leader, Julia Timoshenko.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister ' s prison, was rejected at the time of the second reading of the draft law on the reduction of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was considered unfavourable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoshenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is the political place of the regime; the process has also been suspected in advance in the West.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to be ratified.
Libya's Victory
In the history of liberation, or resurrection, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Kaddafi was buried somewhere in the desert without him.
It's time to identify the winners.
As a rule, Islamists win; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the ordinary law of Sharia, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the punishment for theft is a cutting-off.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be punished; and so forth.
Instead of a dictatorial society consisting of rival clans, the Koran will be united.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is not the only one in its own kind, nor the best, and it would probably not have happened to the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors received help from the unbelievers.
Their only justification is that they believe that NATO led, not the American General, but Allah, whose greatness they glorified after every blow.
And if you're looking for winners in Libya, the West doesn't belong to them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies were delivered from the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to give up Libya's military occupation.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of the Crescents.
Although without occupation, will the oil companies receive the black gold of Libya almost indiscriminately?
Probably won't, and the West will finally be able to resort to useless civil rights protection.
Unless Sharia's followers put an end to this.
The New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are at the heart of investors.
A statistical storm passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries reported GDP in 3 quarters.
Compared with the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stable, Germany and France showed growth.
Nevertheless, today's debt market beats record.
Investors are not only looking at Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP rose by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, where Germany had a better case than expected (growth of 0.3 per cent instead of original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared with the previous quarter of GDP, the Czech Statistical Office has confirmed the trend in the slowing of economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was stable compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy rose by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the Eurozone and the European Union have shown growth compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 per cent, which coincides with analytical forecasts.
Greece's economy showed a preliminary drop of 5.2 per cent.
Its 10-year-old bond income is 28.45 per cent.
Income from both Italian and Spanish bonds is close to a critical note.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are experiencing difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the Czech 1-year bond income remains around 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Assembly has passed a selection in EURO.
In Montenegro, they won the 1:0 and celebrated an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully met the most challenging challenge of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chechnya and the beautiful hill of Peter Iráček, they won the 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was lucky to retain a significant advantage after the home-responsible match, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and made a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first time and great success in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech Republic; and the heroic Iraq; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the European Championship.
The supreme defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vucinic have become the most successful match couple ever since they lost two great opportunities.
Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and thus the Czech football will earn some 200 million Czech crowns.
Since the first minute, the game has been very tense.
Both teams had difficulty conducting combinations; most of the time the game went to the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure on the first-time team of the owners, and the further attacks on the defense line were duly taken over by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have built a living shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
They therefore wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday, Friday morning, before entering the building, the students prayed for death, both in the United States and in Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have built a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme for their own lives.
In its last report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that it was all evidence that Iran had not left an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, Friday, the students’ prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant were followed by a prayer of death, both in the United States and in Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press will aim to establish both in Isfahan and in Natanze, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Question of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and dinner sausage
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are subject to higher standards; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families who are not healthy.
Again, we see the importance of the environment and models of conduct that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears at the tables of children who suffer from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children who suffer from obesity eat free potatoes before an inquiry into the educational event known as the Diaspora is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children who suffer from obesity do not engage in sports, but most families of modern schoolchildren, only 15 per cent of them, have said that their parents find time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last year’s education year; it was attended by nearly 900 primary class students throughout Bohemia.
The Ozierje event was not a second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company General Health Insurance and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient sports load are the main determinants that cause the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either excessive weight or obesity.
"For example, only half of the respondents said that they ate five times a day under the breakfast-loop-loop-loop-loop-hoop-hoop-hoop-hoop-hoop-hoop-hoop-hoop-hoop, as one of the essential conditions of proper nutrition," said one of the findings of the study.
No chain and no sausage at dinner.
Experts warn that even relative details such as family mornings are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school families are leaving together.
In most families, everyone's breakfast is on the separate side.
The quickest opening was the fact that in every ten families, people do not have to die at all.
But tomorrow is the basis for the right day-to-day management.
The study showed that burned food is used more often in families with children who suffer from obesity.
Almost every one, regardless of weight, drinks sweet drinks every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly involved in sports, this figure is reduced by more than twice, up to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Build your own menu.
In another part of the study for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), it was proposed to draw up their own menu based on the products proposed and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The preference of Czech children aged 12-15 is far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large number of painful, meaty, and sweet foods.
"The particular concern is caused by the high popularity of sweet-flavoured drinks," says the final part of the study.
As the main vigil, the shepherd defeated the bird with a little overhang.
However, children had virtually no interest in bees, fish, and vegetables.
Satisfying a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits, provided that relevant information is provided to them.
"Many participants in the study control group showed a significant preference for healthy food when they completed the survey after the completion of the lecture, Ozierje is not an accident," the project said.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet sweet drinks, more children became preferable to just water.
In addition, as a primary care, children were more likely to mention birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet care and shelters.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, according to professionals
In the first article on stylistic training, I visited information in introductory sessions.
I had no idea what would happen next.
The lessons of three experts in this area; the advice on choosing clothing for non-standard figures; and the seminar on how all of this works in real life.
Keep it up, keep it up.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really filled with information.
This time, we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetric.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One short neck, the other boy's figure without proper shape, one more weight rule.
The stylist should know how to significantly reduce the width of his shoulders, lengthen his neck, or add the missing volumes.
We have been advised to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopes, that is, the owners of the cleaner chest and thigh and narrow waist, and not to wear them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in size and size of the waist is so great that it is not possible to improve the waist or waist, there should be at least one thing to order.
You're obviously not sorry for the money you've invested, because perfectly sitting clothes are worthless.
In the jube, you'll feel much better than in the one who always rides, caresssss, finds a plate, and so on.
Children's figures may, on the other hand, wear clothes with gloves, application, height or storage.
Taking into account the abundance of information and types of figures, I'm glad I've had a whole week to realize.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we've got.
Each participant had to think of two together for some celebrity: day and night.
We need to take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's much simpler to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who's just fixed to a tone (please, let me say I'm proud) or quite young Selen Gomes.
We need to cut off the magazine clothing or find it online, print and process using graphic programs.
The Mudbord, which is called the result of the work, then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphic composition.
A stylist not only wears real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was only on Sunday.
A Stylistic Need for Common Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on the types of figures, has brought three specialists to life in this area.
Stylist, Honza Podorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist is able to use one object of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is key to success.
For example, a suit can be worn in a normal way, above the gins and football as a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without any marks, as a plate.
Another option is to hit the sleeve or lift the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I most appreciated the following advice: "You must know the rules perfectly for your work."
Then you can start breaking them,' Jacob told us.
I finally figured out why we're going to get all the definitions and rules that match what and why, when we often see each other in modern journals.
I'm not talking about fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist must have more options in place than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten in pairs), I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the painting, the subject of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with others rather than in reality.
We must have that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorna confirmed that the image and style are often half successful.
Just look at Madonna, who does not have a striking circle, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
Relations with the Czech Republic's stylish services are still quite cold.
Even famous people often think it too much (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we have to wait for them to call us a different size than what they really wear.
Then we're going to Google and we're going to find out if we've written the tabloids anything about the fact that there's some familiarity of the floor/floor, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed that for a stylist, it was not enough to be in fashion and be able to improve at the same time.
Our work is primarily about communicating with the people we wear; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to appreciate people, not to build them up and hold their own opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw out her entire wardrobe, you tell her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you can praise, and advise what you can carry with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that the work bag should be included specifically.
It's a bag you tie around the plate to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as knives, sticky roll or English beads, it should be a nylon thread (styles use it when collecting some items, such as a sum or a pencil), special clips to strengthen the back tissue if it wears too large (paints and similar items are prohibited because they wear clothes) or a set of dressings.
To learn from the lessons and to gain some practical experience, we learned to do the right thing to put on the shoe pads.
Even during surveys in a studio where half smooth can get damage - not about street surveys.
And that's what we did.
You don't have to cover a shoe with knives to keep them out of the way.
This requires the present skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
Those skills didn't touch my soul.
It's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't as easy as talking.
V Need for Speed: escape takes place in America.
Review
What must have been a jobless walk has become a routine morning trip to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and unnecessary mistakes.
The ambitions were to some extent satisfied, but it was not important, since no one obviously wanted to do more work.
Before leaving with a new version with the sub-heading of the Rung, there was a lot of hope.
It was expected that she would move the previous series Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of hunting games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero came out of the car and ran.
As often as this happens with NFS, it is very different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty small arcade race, but the general impression is a few unnecessary mistakes that have been in the game series for several years.
It means, in fact, it's not a mistake, it's an inexplicable developmental line.
The adventure is starting very well.
You're part of a history that Jack, the main hero, has decided to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
Here are a few interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty cannons.
This means that each race is going on its own route, and the individual stages are going on in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there is no feeling that the game is always the same.
Despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are pleasant to watch.
Still, the game does not produce strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in autumn, or high in snowy mountains, it is very pleasant to drive.
In addition, racing from time to time will bring an unusual detail to life.
For example, in the desert you fall into a sandstorm, which is much lowering visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under the lava.
The individual races are pretty well arranged.
There's only a few varieties, but that's enough.
Some time you're trying to get a couple of opponents (in essence a normal race); then you're trying to improve the time (the standard race with a second) or you're fighting one opponent.
Besides, from time to time, you are facing the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of Jack's time is running away from someone and you have to help him with the buttons he needs at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
Although it's amazing that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game because it doesn't add up; given all the above, it's one of the things that make the game more fun.
The gonorrhea model follows the previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a lack.
If you're looking for real life imitations, you're going to have to find somewhere else.
However, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic chases, although better options can be found on the market.
It's all right.
However, some time has passed since problems began.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect complex transformations and clashes from this game, but if you don't have the idea of a collision with an object, how will your car behave, something's wrong.
Usually, when you drive or drive past a flat-flowing car, you sometimes have a hard time dealing with another car, and sometimes in a similar situation, your car begins to break down.
Or you're breaking up.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to make fun.
Restarts are arranged so that if you break or walk away from the trail, the game will bring you back to the point where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start running from the very beginning.
It's helpful if something doesn't work out, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes restarting is not enough, and you have to learn to run a separate race.
The important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often occur in the same places.
For example, some rotations need to be done in a certain way, otherwise you just don't sign in.
In other cases, you will meet civilian cars in a particular location in the same configuration regardless of whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly disturbing in situations when you see your opponent passing easily between two machines moving in the opposite direction, while when you're there, the machines are already in place so you need to either drive them or drop them.
It doesn't matter when you come near them; it's built up so that the situation always happens just before your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game you find several places where, regardless of the time, the same rival entraps you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand up to you in spite of anything.
The thing is, when he walks in front of you, he's making you look bad, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to cause irritation fast.
Sorry, because despite a simple driving model, the game is busy and sometimes so busy with events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's happening around you.
It's not important that you don't miss the concept of fifty unique tracks, the sequence of chases or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the chase is unusual.
You need to track the gears on the way, because that's what your car can change on them, even though in most cases it's enough that you already have.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are approaching cities; powerful American cars are for direct sections of the road; and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, along the high road.
The main story mode mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it is a race on individual sites that you will know in the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal affairs both medals and eyes, common for the challenge regimes and stories.
Many possibilities are available for a higher level of driving: starting from cars and closing the profile data.
In addition, the profile relates to the Autolog online function, which compares, among other things, the results you have achieved with the results of other players and provides a link to the public.
Here is another flaw that is hard to understand; this is an example of the last race in sequence.
You and your car fall into the subway tunnel (we'll consider you're like that) where you're going down the tracks in the dark (we'll consider you're like that).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we would think so) when suddenly you are hit by a subway train turning your car into a metal metal chest.
For a few days, our editor discussed whether it was true that no one thought for a second at the time of the game, or that its creators really thought we were such boulevards.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video set is most pleasant, sometimes even surprising.
Although, in some critical moments, the quality of the record is sometimes rather severe, it is falling.
This is particularly true of events involving a large number of participants, where a good record would not be particularly helpful to you.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's on the lover.
In order to enjoy the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack 'extremes from different styles', but hardly many people buy a game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: escaped rather indisputable.
If the game were to avoid obvious unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Rung is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of infinity.
Of course, it's a good time, but be prepared to be blinded by the disadvantages as an airport searcher.
The Karlova University will take part in the "Students in the Barthet" concert

Ambassador to the EU of Vicenova:
The Czech reputation of beneficiaries and skeptics with respect to the euro.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has caused considerable differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation is stabilized, calmed, and all the players are used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova began his lecture in law school.
She demonstrated how well she adhered to her “Clearly and openly about Europe” motto in the very first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and their relations so simply and clearly that many of the lecturers from the Faculty of Law would be jealous.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompey:
"The critics at first said that he was an ordinary serial office mouse, which can't play any role; I must say, everyone was defeated how well he managed his role."
"The person who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven participating countries has a wonderful relationship with them and who has a clear idea of which side the EU needs to develop."
She explained her new post on international relations and security issues as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?", i.e. how important a step towards the unification and transparency of the Union's policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheeses.
The evaluation continued to focus on a key programme for the EU in the past, in the present and in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a successful one last year.
The Czechs have dealt with the pressing financial crisis; they have overcome this crisis and have organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time had been a negative phenomenon that had done little harm to the Czech Republic.
The Czechs are currently very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis had caused the ongoing siege.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult in view of the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be poor and economical, what areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which will be less; all these issues will be in the future programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "About Europe, the Language of Understanding".
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words and jargons that nobody understands.
How citizens can understand that people in Brussels are not trying to sell curves or round corners, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties.'
It is also going to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more cheques to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - our future
The Ambassador argues that the Czechs are considered Euro-Sceptics; as well as people who note negative rather than positive aspects of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believed that several factors were involved: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivated letters; and, at the same time, little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we join in a word, the French next to me says, "Oh, what about the assembly again, the Supreme Group?" and he doesn't like the hats.
In the future, the Vicenova Union is looking forward to a largely new set of rules for the budgetary policies of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of two-speed, unless a multi-speed Europe is more realistic.
"We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution for enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that wanted to be united, while those that didn't want could remain side by side."
"The number of such institutions will increase; it will actually be a two-speed Europe," Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompey in promoting the rule that all issues relating to the EU as a whole should be discussed by all the countries parties, not just those in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
The IBM novelty will enter the second century of its existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest is likely to be "long-lasting."
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was laid by her first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson-old.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His "Immediate" slogan thus became a press release about which the life of the future giant was being developed (and also called his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson had carefully worked out.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement to the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because he remained faithful to his original values, although he was not afraid to change everything around him.
In our first hundred years, it has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," said the current leader of Samuel J. Palmizano on the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson came to the issue of employee concerns, like Batya in the Czech Republic, IMB staff were one of the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniform and complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same advances are long-term IBM relations with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company has had a brilliant application of talented people, one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, which has given it a great choice.
It is in line with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan under which the woman, Virginia Rometti, will change Palmizano next year.
She worked in IBM for thirty years; she is currently director of sales, marketing and development.
For the past few years IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, where many future innovations occur.
It is not surprising that many ideas work in companies around half a million people.
Organization with a good reputation
The strong position of the company in the business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning IBM concept was rather an organization rather than a technology company," said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business issues using technology," adds George Colony from Forrester Research.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that it is the most universal technology company, developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, with five of its staff receiving the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a ATM, a bank card, a financial soup, a barcode and a discette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM has become the second largest technology company this year (first place in Apple) and Microsoft has been the first time since 1996.
Look ahead
Not all of its products were tasted by buyers and entered the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online service Prodigy and computers IBM PCjr.
"If your business is defined as moving forward, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundation on several platforms -- if they don't work, it's giving up.
It therefore differs, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, who is based and experienced in Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
The main revenues of IBM are services, approximately one fifth in each case comes from computer programs and hardware.
As in 1990, with double capital, it was the strongest equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets of $15 billion, while at the same time investing 58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
It continued its investment even after 2008, when the current economic crisis struck the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who has increased the number of investments in the years of the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price for IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have increased steadily.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything but its own values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
History of IBM: from raw knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original title "Corporates, Tabulations, Records" was quite complex.
She named it IBM in 1924, originally called a brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was a merger of four companies, the history of which began in the 1880s.
They had technology, such as the legendary "table hours", i.e. the hours of fixed time when staff members came and left work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also led the company's board of supervisors until 1930.
Flint hired a competition company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then turned the founder of IBM into a shadow - Watson's ideas remain the basis for unscrupulous corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, beginning with the production and sale of various equipment for business, from raw knives and meat products to cash machines.
For the first four years, Watson’s leadership doubled to $9 million, and the company’s expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his place in the director's chair was taken by his son, Thomas Watson-younger.
Under his leadership IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first language of programming.
In 1960, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights -- on Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 -- human flights to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which established computer standards at the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
20 years later, IBM sold the production of Chinese computers from Lenovo, while purchasing the PricewaterhouseCoopers consultancy office, thus focusing fully on consulting and services with high added value.
In the last three years, IBM has achieved great success with its concept of Smarter Planet.
Its objective is to use technology wisely in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the field of trade IBM has recently presented a Smarter Commerce platform that helps business to control the entire business cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at the same time, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ is also managing the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where the World-level Research Group is also working on the recognition of the subject.
Rigurage about his unfaithful husband:
Iveta, leave yourself a fool, I don't need it anymore!
Darina Richtaržovov (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtary (53), became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartošov (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wanted to wait, and marked clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner anymore," Richtaržov explained.
When Darina Richtarzhov gave her blood to Bartošov in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she had Yvette leave Rzycan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the song.
Moreover, he publicly acknowledged his love for her.
After a while, Darina gave up, making her look like she had calmed down with her husband; and now she's finally forgiven him.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richtarge and Bartošov were ever to break up, his wife would not accept him with scattered bonds.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him away."
"At the same time, he will end his days, not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but the man with whom I am bound," Richtarzhov said, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on being united.
Joseph had nothing to do with his wife’s rejection of him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union continues to function; I'm responsible for repair, garden, home and shopping."
"Darina and I are getting along perfectly well, but we don't share the bed anymore," Richtarz told Blake magazine.
He claims that if Richtaržov finds new love, he will not interfere with it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who and if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Eve and I'm in full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Mature women: Are they devoted to you?
When you ask men to call some typical bad women habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Dear ladies, do you know yourself in the following lines that describe several female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains that you're going to the shops all the time?
You need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like making big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a stupid habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping.
And yet, which one of you would like to give up a walk around a store of clothes in search of ideal sitting clothes and examples of it (if any, in different color options) in examples?
Maybe it's a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you said your second half to wait outside...
Everlasting Dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"I have to drop at least five pounds -- maybe I'll start doing gymnastics?"
"You're still drawing on me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you go into a group of women intertwined in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop following yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to the constant complaints of their partners in their appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more often such complaints are made, the more women are angry with them.
The most important order and purity
It's like an endless story.
Mother's glass, chicken cleaning, mother's sex, anti-smoking, clean-up bathroom-- at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming to a clean café in dirty bottles; children for scratching in clean sleeves and fingerprinting their fingers on a window glass in a hotel that was so difficult to clean?
If you are suffering from this “disobedience”, try to realize that it is bad to fall into extremes; and that order and purity should not be in the first place in your family.
A healthy desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships as well as your entire family.
Order of command
"Put the white in the basket."
"Are you going to put on dirty legs tomorrow?"
"The open seams for vessels should not be on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may feel that it is very offensive.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command so often...
Shuffles
Some women like to gossip, insult, and pry intrigue against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, and why.
From time to time, we're probably all breaking up.
Let's be frank, that's the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious issues, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the women's working group, pose a major threat to their environment.
Jagra and Voračeka's results have helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transmissions of the hockey attacker Jaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia to win 5:3 on the Karolin ice. He again became the most effective Czech player.
In both cases, Claude Girau used the experience of a thirty - nine - year - old star; he added another transmission and was declared the best player.
Two successful match transfers also belonged to a player in one team with Yagre Jacubu Voraček.
After the match, Yagre told the foreign journalists that he had predicted a wonderful evening for the jury.
"I told him before the match he'd forget the het-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel such things," Yagre explained, after which giru shot the goal at the first opportunity that Fliers gave.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "cheese trail".
The closing Harrikeins Voraček seized the Shibe and handed it over to Maxima Talbot, who killed between the circles.
During the second to the first break of the home game, Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap with a lot of advantages, but Flyers was again taken back to the beginning of the second time.
Especially the jury.
After his successful delivery, Yagra killed the third goal; his strike was further turned into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best league game, but he's exactly in the best three," said Jagr, complimenting his central.
"I never thought I'd end my career with a hockey game like him."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now my turn has come," Jagr added.
Caroline made the game more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Routu and the Dwyer Penalties, reducing the gap to one goal.
The further complications prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"The proponer worked well in our area."
"He hit the shib, I hurried, and Reed crossed the far end."
"I'm glad it worked," Voraček described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place at the Eastern Conference.
The protector of the Montreal Czech team Yaroslav Špaček did not complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to the trauma of the upper body.
Together with an experienced Canadian defender, they lost their two-eyed advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of prisons.
Tomash the Plecanic couldn't kill during one of their attacks.
More than lost eyes, the home coach was upset with a large number of rear row injuries, as the match ended with only five defenders.
It's a bad situation.
"We've just finished the match with one experienced player, the others were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just need to calm down," said Jacques Martin.
"For replacement, it was devastating and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the shark from our zone."
"What was our weak side," added P.K.Suban's defender
After thirty attacks by Czech golfer Onjay Pavelec helped Winnipeg to win Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Golls, who interrupted the five-year series of defeats, were killed by five different players.
Price dynamics for travel since 1989
Until 1989, only five public tourist agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Cédok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at that time mainly sold tours to the socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, resulting in significant restrictions on Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually through socialist countries.
If a Czech-Slovak citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; another individual trip was impossible.
At the time, tourist agencies offered trips to the West, but it was necessary either to stand all night, with a common bag, or to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
A currency permit was required to travel to the West, and it was not issued to politically untrustworthy people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czech currency was not freely converted; without the currency, it was impossible to obtain money (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often, the Czechs had their vacation home, which led to the emergence of large numbers of cats and summer homes, which is still the custom today.
Since 1989 tourism in the Czech Republic has thus survived the present revolution.
While before 1989 the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that by 1989 we could not freely visit Croatia's most popular at present, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe had been abolished, and this was the beginning of a huge wave of short journeys mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get on their way to the West, and they all wanted to go there for a while.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, since their income at the time did not include a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring their own food (conservations, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown. After decades our tourists can finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income grew, leading to another important situation around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourism agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries except the United States, which made our journeys even easier.
The next major event in the history of post-revolution journeys took place in 2000, leading to a major demand for the historical first direct charter trip from the Czech Republic to the exotic country of Thailand.
Since then, direct charter travel has been made by Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will be sent to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need for visas for Czech tourists, and our country has always joined the most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, more than half of their vacations were spent abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during abroad leave, including their expenses in the assignment item.
The general meeting must elect the President, the threat of the road is returned
For about five months, the Czech football had no president, and there was a risk that the successor Ivan Gashek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) would not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Hamburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what electoral rules to follow.
Without that, one of the three candidates will not begin to vote.
The Indrezh Reichle, Miroslav Pelta and Thomas Paclik want to take the lead in Czech football.
Gaschek left his post in June, leaving, he invited his colleagues to join him and find a strong personality that would lead the football in the future.
However, Gašek's era re-loaded football between the two chambers of the association, which cannot elect one candidate.
This was clearly 16 September when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had recently arrived at the National House in Prague, Smileov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general assembly - only legal representatives or officials who had been authorized.
This has since been partially resolved through the recommendation of the State and the Law Institute that a delegation based on the powers conferred cannot be made possible.
Disputes with regard to electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help too much, although in its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
Opinions on voting have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we get to the 3rd round and get out of the way?
“The challenge is whether to follow the established standards or to find another model,” said one of FAČR Vice Presidents Dushan Freedom, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received considerable support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is claimed that Moravia agrees with compromise - to consider the winner of the candidate ' s election with the highest number of voters in both chambers.
The Czech side insists that the winner should vote at least two thirds in the overall percentage ratio.
"Nonetheless, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of the two chambers," Freedom agreed with Moravia's arguments, and he said that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing rules.
Tomas Paczlik agreed with his opinion a few unexpected times, although the election rules, as defined by the statute, were assessed by Pelta more than other candidates.
"I'd like the elections to go as far as the constitution is concerned."
"I want to avoid all possible representative nonsense, as in the previous general assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzeň, who was the first candidate; and in his statements he was mostly opposed to Pelte.
The Pelta remains an optimist.
He believes that the new president will be known in Hamburg; he also hopes that candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional stress will calm down after today's expected national assembly in the European Championship."
"Successful football again, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablonec. Among the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very different."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to adapt the rules deliberately."
"This could cause another collapse of the general assembly."
"I hope a healthy sense will win," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, individual negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved to the winner.
The additional voyage, which was to be delivered, among other things, to Vice-Presidents Dalibor Doger and Reichla in Podgorica, did not depart from Prague in the morning due to technical failure, and requested an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the venue of a re-playing match.
Finally, a meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected to take place on Wednesday, can be crucial.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like the opponents of the country's strongest sports association to reach an agreement.
Many: government subsidies; football credit; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with a new Czech sport direction following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik enters the presidential struggle because he does not see an appropriate candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of the football team, Plzeň Tomas Paclik had seen a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements to the President of the Czech Football Association (FACHR), he would not even claim a high position.
"If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Paclik CTK.
Paclika's motive for fighting Miroslav Pelt and Indrezhi Reich - to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged election favor, from entering FAČR.
Moreover, Paclik emphasizes that in the event of a victory, he will remain the president only until 2013, when a regular general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be held by an experienced top manager who was not too involved in football.
"I've talked to a few people that might be relevant."
"It was horrible to hear some of them say that they don't even want to be involved in Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that opinion," he said.
The main dispute between Paclika and Pelta is now related to the relations between the latter and Roman Berbrom, president of the Pulsen Regional Football Association. Berber is a man of a controversial reputation known as an influential lobbyist who is able to influence the votes of delegates of the general congregation.
Paclik thus considered it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and the football will not move forward."
"With Berbra's support, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," said Paclik.
He points out that several years ago, the name of Pelta was written during a phone interview in an investigation into corruption; Pelta was able to avoid convictions.
"I don't know what reward Pelta's victory would bring for football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, he now does not mention his previous statement that he is "selling the Pulsen Club if Pelta becomes president."
If Paclik wins on Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelt in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclik supported before the general meeting in September, which ended in Fiasco.
"He would be the first to come to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present it in the head of the assembly."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have a nose in what I don't understand," said Paclik, who drew a lot of attention to himself in September, when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade led by the Man Macel, who changed Dagmar Damkov.
Paclik argues that he will risk managing the association.
He referred to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he has managed the Plzeň team, which with the help of him celebrated his first triumph in the League in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
“Restricting the influence of some groups of people who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, leading to repugnant situations,” said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krjetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money to sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points that the new president needs to take care of."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they must state clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship to the Plzen Club as a burden, although he argues that President FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Jablonese, and Rachel with the Prague Dock.
"It's not an ideal option."
"And yet I don't see the point in the hypocritical transfer of my shares to someone else at the Pulz Club when I'm about to return there six months later," said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new FAČR rules to avoid the electoral path
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for the new FAČR rules in order to avoid disputes about election rules in the future.
Before the negotiations in Hamburg on Thursday, Jablonec's official remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the pre-election struggle will significantly diminish the expected success of our football team today.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus both on representation and on obtaining funding.
He decided to participate in the elections last moment before the last general meeting, so a two-month delay could be useful for him to resist his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that it is now the time for someone to lead an association," claims the person who is mainly associated with the Jablonese club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believed that the current problems were caused by the ephoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the June General Assembly."
"If different forms of representation had not been adopted, we would already have been president since September," Pelta said.
He referred to the census of the key document of the civil association as a false target for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will assume personal responsibility if this attempt proves unsuccessful."
"This is a fundamental question that we cannot exist without," says Pelta.
In addition, he says he's not trying to separate himself from his rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Indrezhi Reich, whom he appreciated for his legal education; he fully recognized the fact that his opponent had to become his first vice-president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paccik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been on football for more than a year and has made some success."
"No matter what, his attacks were inconvenient, and many people were amazed at the methods of his pre-election campaign."
"That's why some of them now doubt his true personality," Pelta said about her rival, and Pelta himself claims to be faithful to the declarations he made in September.
He considered his main weapons the knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to national gathering.
The national collection should represent the whole football.
"I would also try to put an end to all incidents, starting with the case of the Goddess or the consequences of the last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then focus on negotiations with both the private and the public sectors to ensure a sufficient amount of money for the whole football," a 40-year-old candidate told CTC two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football leader would not result in staff dismissals.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual staff," he said.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he believed that delegates would not come to Nimburg in vain on Thursday.
"If the only question is how to hold the third round, we can deal with it."
"The football needs the confidence he can get, just by choosing his leader," says Pelta, who remains optimistic two days before the key day of his career.
Rachel promises that under his leadership FAČR will start working actively
If the meeting on Thursday of the Indrezhi Reichl, the Vice-President, would become the President of the Czech Football Association, many in the Association would be dissatisfied.
Rachel promises that if he is selected, it will be a difficult time.
He wanted to establish changes in the system and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual areas in football.
He also promised to address the problem of the Bogemen; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the former President, Ivan Gashek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football in general."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national collecting, professional football and youth football activities.
"That's why I don't want to say that I'm doing it myself," Rachel said in her interview with the C.T.C.
"I am a team player, and I want to distribute powers in the executive committee so that each member will focus on a specific area."
"I'm carefully assigning tasks so that in each of these segments, football will take a big step forward."
"It probably won't please many people, because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly caused him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there is any meaning in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put their fingers in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Nonetheless, many people have told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's trust I can't give up," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to interrupt it all."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before the Gašek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what Mirek Pelta is hardly competent to do."
"He's surrounded by people who play football in such a way that it's only available to the chosen ones."
"I can be accused in a lot, but it's not about subjectivity anymore."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everything will have a good time, not just a chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he denied the charge that he would only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to claim back, I plan to make the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and Moorish parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravia teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
While Pulzn Paclik's ruling club entered the presidential struggle, Rachel was not reluctant to assess his chances of victory.
"Nonetheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as my vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Rachel, who has successfully saved tens of millions of crowns in unfavourable contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for not having unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was "exempted from the process of return of creditability to Czech football", he considers another rival, Paclica, a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked well in Pulsen this year."
"If he is selected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without any significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't be breaking the facts for his own good," said Rachel about his rival.

One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder has been unable to get around during her research trip for the last half of the year — without her purchase suit.
She was lying on her back in the water, looking up at the taste-shaped dome, swimming to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the end of the pool, and fell in love with carefully restored swimming pools in the ar-new style.
She had to add every favorite pool to her notebook, with important details about the building and the history of the building.
The history of Meder's architecture has seen more than 200 swimming pools - and has now brought together the impressions of its recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of the Cup), where everything came from the public pools in Munich to historical shopping gardens in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited the bathrooms in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is the present enthusiasm for buying culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in water everything else.
The only defect is that the swimmers must rest with the blue capillary plate and the smell of chlorine, while the fugitives can breathe with the brilliance of the pine forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says a woman living in Vienna Meder.
"That's how I started to collect beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Swimming in the pool and the oil found in the sauna is a healing factor in the baths, because in Meder's view, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a pleasure to the eye if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the pool sex, you have the surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is clearly reflected: high surfaces, colour tiles and trampling.
The illustrated edition of The Joy of the Cup on 190 pages contains valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of the health oasis - and it is your desire to water.
The water collector Meder found several outstanding specimens during the study in Hungary.
It found rich nitrates in the karst cave (Mishkoltz-Tapolce) and thermal bath filled with water, in a building built in the shape of a bottle (Város Termálfürdö in Jasbren), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths, such as 100-year-old baths in Budapest.
Many of the heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, have a stunning look. You can see all the Towers from the bathroom on the roof or look at the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anthony, and there is a steam window that lets you see what's happening on the floor.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for bathers in Langenfelde.
In winter, a pair of three open shells appear to be quite small in the background of the Ectal Mountains.
Algambra in Schwarzvalde
Not every pool in the pool met the smell of chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell the cheese. The bath names of Arpad in Beijing smell so much oil that you may find it difficult to believe that you are in a healing source.
The smell causes hydrocarbons in the water in the bloodstream. The water is almost black from the bloodstream, which is attached to the skin as soon as you get into the pool, the health experience of a certain type.
At some point, however, Iris Meder was disappointed to find her beautiful bathing grounds, and when she tried to visit the open pool of the Czech bath in Lugačović, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms designed by the architect Dushan Yurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked into the visible sights of the red-white-yellow-style ar-new-style building, she saw mushrooms growing between brown tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was halted on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzvalde, the Palace of the thermal water in Bad Wildbad.
The Basins have already passed three construction stages. You will find not only the neo-Roman elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritian Algambra-style hall, which was added about 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace, a favorite swimming pool of pools Iris Meder, was not just because it was born in Schwarzwald.
"This achievement is so masterful to combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Getting into the thermal pool in such a yard is obviously a secondary exercise.
Speculation of agricultural production
The Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Titus
Will Doyce Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann gave the working group the task of investigating the impact of speculation on the world ' s poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg-
According to one study, 84 per cent of German citizens find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Dutch Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems faced by the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Shuman, shows that the world's stock market is playing a high price - and the banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is directed directly against the head of Doice Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses, such as Godman Sax and Morgan Stanley, are trading in the same way.
Product prices were originally thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, the majority of experts now agree that the players have rejected the rules of the proposal and the demand - and are being made available to the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann has responded to criticism and has pledged to investigate the charges and stated that no trade “is worth risking the good reputation of Doyce Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Doha Bank, with recommendations for action.
The Bank ' s head then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may be reduced or stopped at all.
Akkermann is working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude to the financial sector. "The attitude towards rising food prices is an example of how foolish banks are currently acting against common interests."
As Ackermann's chief lobbyist has a certain responsibility, Bode thinks.
"The Bank's daughter must remove all investments that make money at food prices from the portfolio," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's about starving people or the daughter Bank's reputation."
Akkermann ' s immediate reaction was surprising at first, but in the meantime, the director would like to have an unmistakable image only a few months before his office was completed.
The Bank's daughter announced on Monday that the president would not go to the monitoring board as planned.
The elimination of the speculative dispute on the food market could improve its image.
He also did not have to worry about the costs - with the consequences of his successor's case.
Each second would have refused to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday, and the study was conducted for the Institute of Social Studies and Statistical Analysis Forsa on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 attended.
Not more than eleven per cent believe that investments making a food price rate are acceptable to the Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade; according to the study, each second would withdraw the contributions that ultimately lead to the speculation of goods.
43 per cent would recommend getting out of the bank, 49 per cent said they were thinking about closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st Century House in Vienna
Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeburg Vinsovski
Architectural history, with excursions, falls and happy endings. The Pavilion of Austria won prizes for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, became a museum in Vienna, was deserted and abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, courageous people who expressed faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Schwancera won Gran-pri on architecture in 1958 for its light silver construction of steel and glass.
The building is considered to be a hub in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he celebrated the world in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder garden BMW and her sister, a glass-shaped building.
Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss Garden around the South Vienna Station, transformed and opened as the Museum of 20th century in 1962, and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th century" for this reason.
In any case, the building did not approach the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not contain walls on which art could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna had received a new home.
The house has been deserted since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far refurbished the pavilion, which was called the House of the 21st Century, and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is the Belveder Museum office, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in all respects a joyful event.
Agnes Husley-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery of Belveder in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Huslin-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant youth figure career, which worked at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and conservators to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to be a permanent exhibition of Fritz Voruba, coffee and bookstore along with contemporary art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict control of the budget
Krishnitz was then an ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Session Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied at Schwancer at the University of Vienna technology, and the pavilion was for him “an extremely important place”, where he attended the exhibitions “ almost every week”.
He knew the original design and the tasks that were ahead of the building, the building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that have arisen during the last restructuring were much more serious, and the idea was "energy absorber," says Krishanitz.
Window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, reinforced with a glass fibre glass, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-end safety glass.
The steel versions of the heat bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the floor.
Two lower floors have created space for new use of the building, a falling light source between the building and the street provides lighting - almost a new building, but the Schwanzer pavilion is still clear.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was decorated in the old red and brown color of protection from corrosion.
Hol Movie Theatre is the same as it was before.
All of this is under the strict control of museum management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum administration," Krishnitz said, pointing to an uneven style in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite restrictions, problems and conversions.
Krishnitz recently noticed that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a rough, typical story of "a chapel in the city".
Such an architecture is “not always in its place” and still wants to “stimulate the present awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is in a very right place, as the city's planning has brought unexpected success. A fully redesigned headquarters with offices and real estate is growing around the Swiss Palace.
The house of the 21st century may be supplemented by the second building of Krishnitz, the collector of French von Gabsburg, has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city on its location in the neighbourhood of the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion winter crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has launched an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of winter trains.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year in order to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to the internal anti-crisis plan for Deutsche Bahn, Bild reported that by 2015 total investments were planned at around 300 million euros.
Investments are designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of staff employed in the snow treatment from roads and platforms will be increased by 2 to 16,000.
The aim is to clean the platforms from snow and ice before the start of work and 90 per cent of the necessary shots within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, Head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and delaying the winter trains to meet with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as it did not catch up with the reserves at the time of the deterioration of the weather conditions.
Many new regional trains for years were expected to be approved by the Federal Railway Service.
There have also been some delays in the provision of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE train axles much more during the years after one of the ICE trains broke down on the main train station in Cologne.
Lake Bank will pay millions of fines in the United States
New troubles followed the riots around Joseph Akkermann, Director General Doice Bank: Doice Bank threatens a fine in the United States in many millions of pounds of sterling.
The recent industrial giant in the U.S. has been forced to face little family problems. The Bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million) to settle disputes arising after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem was about the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Management of Credit Unions (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and submerged credit unions.
"We are pleased to have resolved this problem without referring the parties to the court," said the representative of the Dutch Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not accept its responsibility.
The same is true of Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Mattz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
National Credit Unions Management (NCUA), is responsible for U.S. credit unions and is involved in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is struggling to compensate for the losses that have flown from billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The Governor also drew attention to other major banks, and in the summer he set up a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspected mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a mortgage credit pool.
They're backed up by internal loans.
This led to the fate of a number of financial companies, when the real estate market in the United States was hit in 2007.
The U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long time to live in September 2008 in the grave financial crisis.
A few years later, U.S. banks are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims requiring compensation or punishment for fraud.
The Federal Housing Funding Agency (FHFA) is the largest claims.
It accuses 18 major international banks of acquiring approximately $200 billion from US credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Bank's daughter is also at risk of being prosecuted by FHFA for multiple agreements of a total cost of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator demands that the Frankfurt headquarters bank assume responsibility for “substantial losses”, but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Bank's daughter rejected the claims as unfounded and reported her intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffett's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
As of March, he had purchased shares of more than $10 billion.
So far, Warren Buffett, the largest American investor in the world, has always stated that he does not invest in computers and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM ' s annual report changed its view of investment in this sector.
According to Buffeta, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffeta's investment was assessed as a risar.
IBM, an IT plant veteran, has now received the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the U.S. business channel CNBC Buffett reported that in March he had acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM shares of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said even IBM had no knowledge of his involvement until recently.
He commended the management that had been able to make progress even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
A significant time for IBM was focused on high-income IT services such as date centres.
The founder of the computer industry, which has been offering software and consulting services for over 100 years, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffett's been running away from technology companies so far.
He claims he invests only in those companies he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway has shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher Rück), together with some 80 of his own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquires a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and builds on it one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His life course, however, remained modest.
made it a cultural figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct in making money brought him the Oracle of Omaha.
The price of IBM shares increased by one per cent before opening markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Unresolved risk
Following the discovery of the "sex in Civicau", Turkish media began to question the power of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers said about "blood ideology", which is now being resurfaced on the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of the right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been a response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-German community.
For many tourists in Germany, this news has caused long forgotten fears. Such rights-extremist attacks on Turks have not since been burned in Mellen in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, but there is a xenophobia in Germany.
However, the rights-extremist network now found is of such magnitude that it is not yet fully aware of it.
"Rebirth of blood ideology?" was the title of the internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret intelligence officer, and expresses concern that the German authorities might be involved in the rights-extremist side.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded peacefully by referring to the victims of racial hatred by a silent picket against the Brandenburg Gates in these exits.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light, as a history of success.
In some Turkish media, education was like a waste. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the "Haber X" Turkish Internet, commenting on the murder series.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not miss the occasion of this parallel.
"He makes bad smell" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their work had contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful area were severely criticized on the German-Turkish Internet Forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought of monitoring suspects in the rights-extremist circles before.
Some authors have come up with a rather severe rhetoric. "If they continue to act as closely as possible, migrants will have no choice other than armed self-defence."
"This will be the best self-defense."
"The peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the entire network will be exposed and on the fairness of punishment," says Selen.
The crimes in Mellen and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to the world in Germany.
The photograph of burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply engraved in German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown to the Turks here so clearly that they are in danger, and to the Germans, that mistrust and equality can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Do not repeat the previous error
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Cole refused to visit the survivors in Mellen.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the burnings in Zolingen, but his participation in the memorial ceremony in Cologne was taken by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel to account in his speech for the taxes paid by the Turks in Germany,
It is as if he had defined the value of the person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in Turkish media has again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks to the present German State has deepened since then.
It was clear that efforts should now be made to identify and reassess the right-wing terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal at Lake Zurich
Most European banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has not yet been anchored during the financial crisis, and since then it has been constantly fighting with one another and with the other.
Now he has to return to the German course.
Alex Webber probably didn't suspect he'd take that role.
In July, following his effective withdrawal from the position of the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013, he would begin his work at least as President of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was obviously in a hurry, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its renewed strength, and made several friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Fillier and Oswald Grubel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London went through the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of UBS has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take his position?
Weber has to consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said Tuesday, he will be the President of the Council in May, rather than in 2013.
It's not gonna be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He was secondly responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved that he had long deserved the name "the biggest bank scandal in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently he has managed the world's largest assets and, on the other, has not come out of scandals.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank is not saving anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had a wonderful reputation.
The Bank combined the image of a hidden and sustainable but at the same time a hunting asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the biggest player in the investment bank.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more stable clients than any other bank in the world,
and entered the league of the world's largest banks as an investment bank.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a professor of banking, who has long taught at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains: "I have always brought my UBS students as a model of a good bank."
"Know what we know now, you can ask how I could be so wrong."
He really made a big mistake.
Only in 2007 did it become clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered to be a prominent intellectual and to the same extent a shining banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The Investment Unit of the Bank tried to play on substandard valuable papers and had to write billions.
You want to believe you don't, but UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs in order to withstand the crisis.
The Bank was indeed able to find investors -- but investors, whose services many bankers had recently refused -- one very clear Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, so secret that even its name was not reported.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to declare new billions of losses, and the chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the second at the salary level of the Chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, retired in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred, and due to the lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was at risk of collapse and the State had to save it.
The National Bank has purchased UBS toxic paper for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation has paid six billion Swiss francs for convertible bonds with a binding conversion to become the bank's successor.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the huge banks in the small country.
Finally, the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was five times more than all of Switzerland's production (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred soon after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was ready to transfer data from permanent clients who may have been taxed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unwarranted income from business plus fine.
UBS thus acknowledged more or less that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS lost what was always his advantage in fighting for rich clients, a veil of secrecy.
After that, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as it was before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The client's cash flow started.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main areas of its activity, in investing due to miscalculations and in asset management as a result of assistance and tax evasion.
And everything just calmed down and it seemed that UBS was able to break down the situation, as this affair with an apherist-trader happened, and the only trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
Clearly, risk management in the investment office is not working yet.
"Adobolian incident has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks is also unquestionable: "The UBS problem is that he does not have a risk control tool".
It was the caution of the Swiss bankers for a long time that kept the world's largest assets -- not too risky, but safe for money, whether or not the world was broken off outside the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss banks' safes have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the fine taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Her mood is just classic.
The main office of the bank is located in Zurich in Banhofstrass, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, in the area of snowcapped Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops of the Confiserie Sprüngli type, you can find such Jewelry companies as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been available here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Court of Creddy Swiss and elite private banks, such as Julius Bear.
The heavy door leads to UBS.
Along the walls of marble, there's a lot of big leather on the wall, and a number of the bank's emblem is a large "safe" sign.
UBS knows his clients need it, security.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point rejected Swiss concepts of banking - or, according to one of the small Swiss banks, they were betrayed.
He would not like to see his name in the newspaper - like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large - in particular in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
He thinks the Swiss have something to add here.
"And if there's anything, it means they've adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs a long time ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank that changed UBS, which brought him the first big profits, and then the fiasco, and no other financial institution in Europe lost as much money in the jungle as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became evident on 15 October 2008.
"In that environment, a small coalition of seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of the country," writes Lucas Hassig in his book Crah UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If the Swiss banks ask, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined a large group in June 1998.
A bank was established, which was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This also helped the two banks that raised UBS to complement each other. One was a rich but progressive bank that specialized in asset management in Zurich; the other was not such a rich but much more internationalized.
International investment banks suddenly got access to a large amount of money that they could use to turn the most powerful wheel.
Two names relate to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffley, Executive Director of the UBS group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wolfley and Ospell were a team of dreams," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, an intellectual, a modest and deeply understanding model and statistics, and Ospel, with his inner instinct, went all the way up, starting with an intern in the bank."
But Ospell finally went to Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride is ahead of defeat.
UBS employees remember well the meetings of members of the government in which Wolfley has always repeated the same slogan - to admire Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the tournament table, where the success of the banks was achieved.
UBS wanted to go to the top of this table.
He was able to do part of it.
UBS was the largest player in currency and public securities trade.
The management consultants, however, indicated a weak position and therefore, which is called "permanent income" in the banking terminology, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
To shut the door, UBS entered an adventure that hardly cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in American substandard securities.
This was developed in a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgages and sold them further - continuing to bear the risks itself.
Even when other banks have long sought a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought up until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," said bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to go after the other as the attempt to bring the bank in order was more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts to UBS have become a child game with chairs and remain hopeless to date.
In front of anyone who will lead this huge bank, a task is almost impossible.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned his back on all existing business models.
Gaeger's bank analyst already had the idea of turning down the investment bank, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
Bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment needs to be substantially exploited.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Hermotty, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker actually considered it only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly separated with its predecessor Grubel.
He has been able to show the character in the past, and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he is in charge of UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to its condition in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions are probably axel Webber.
Publicly, he has just said that they and his wife are looking for a place in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe draw down the US stock exchange
The escalating recession in Europe deteriorated the mood of American investors early in the week.
The change of Governments in Athens and Rome had not had much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has clouded the hope that a debt crisis can be overcome in the future.
The general relief that followed the change of Governments in Rome and Athens did not receive any support.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek bottlenecks were still half-full, not half-empty, but now the problems are back in the first place, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on sale lists.
The industrial index of Dow Jones closed at 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer in trade ranges between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
A larger S&P 500 index was closed at 1251 points, falling by one per cent.

In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5985 points.
In 17 countries, the euro area's industry has significantly reduced production and adjusted to the end of growth.
Eurostat's statistical service reported that in September companies had made two per cent less than in the previous month.
"We're not on the island, we depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe would hardly be able to resist recession quickly and that banks would demonstrate further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffett could only confirm these fears, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still difficult for Europe to do everything it needed to end the crisis.
He therefore believed that it was too early to invest in European public bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffet has released a ten-year-old principle into the garbage bin and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM amounted to more than ten billion dollars in the trade price of the shares of this older company, almost one per cent against the trend.
The shares were closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffett stated that he had paid an average of $170 for the share and now has a share of 5.5 per cent.

Bank of America's shares fell by 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank has turned almost all remaining shares of the China Building Bank into cash, with $6.6 billion.
The Bank is primarily planning to support its share of capital net profit from the sale in order to comply with stricter rules.
The aircraft manufacturer Boing won, reducing the losses on Dow-Jones.
The share price rose by 1.5 per cent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.

Concealed Caves Fill Cities
The players are considered to be troublebirds in many places, and today experts say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to escape the cities.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The caves of centuries have been part of the urban landscape, but people who complain about thunder and noise are growing in many human settlements.
A solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first symposium on crows, experts in Lear, East Frisia, claimed that the player could no longer be removed from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
The conservatives claimed that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected toys, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitat areas.
The growing construction and cutting of traditional trees have made life difficult for birds.
The crows are safe.
There are large colonies of more than 600 parents in the city of Zest in Westfalia and in the northwest of Ivere, Dipholce, Ahima under Bremen and Lere.
The unparalleled project of shooting holes in Lere caused unfavourable newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the capture of birds in their traps and their killings as special cruelty.
"There's no such thing as the physical movement and the spooking of anything," said the architect and landscape designer Werner Cliver of Lere.
The bending of water currents or the rubbing of trees often has adverse consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are scattered, and large colonies are divided and extended into other areas."
Dissemination may be possible only in the form of an exception to hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're going to have to live with them, and to get rid of them is no choice."
There will be no problem in urban areas, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
A combination of the flight of birds from sheltered areas and their incentive to return to other areas could be an exit.
“Information stands instead of benzopils” was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uto Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. “We need to be confident to live with this problem.”
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational enemy route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Golstein, where information stands on the lives of highly thoughty players.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also voiced his opinion on the complaints made by birds, "The noise transmits a lot of information, and they have to tell each other a lot."
The mind and the smile of these birds came into the legends, and the players often use not only the tools to grasp the pieces, but also the tools themselves.
Researchers in conduct at Cambridge University recently protested the measure of a bird’s mind on four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they needed to knock on the raindrop to get the beak of prayer.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to crush the rain.
In another experiment, matching players had to face a more complex challenge.
The researchers put a small weed with a mole in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get a cockroach.
But the researchers gave them pieces of lead.
All four birds were used to make blood and use blood to seal the liver by hand and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have been able to do this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo concludes Portugal on Euro-2012
The hope of the Bosnians and the Turks for victory in the last minute has not been maintained for a long time.
Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last seats at the Euro-2012 Championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of the superstar Christian Ronald, who killed for 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 6-2 (2:1), perfectly formed its fifth Euro exit after 0:0 in the first phase.

The former Wolfsburg gamer of English champion Manchester City sent a ball of his head to the bottom of the barn at 33 minutes, but the ball did not cross the line of the gate.
Iraq Kills the Czech Republic
Then Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding turned his attention to the center.
Following the attack on Elder Poštig in the Bosnian police station at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese game was simulated and showed him the yellow card.
Stark also sentenced suspicious criminals for playing by hand after Fabius Quentran-Misimovic had carried it out.
Since the end of the 2004 European Vice-Champion, the account has been sealed with four more goals.
Peter Iráček had all the remaining doubts about the 81-minute check.
The 1976 European Championships are sent to the European Championship on the fifth round.
The team of coach Michael Bilek and the legions of the Bundesligi Michael Kadlez (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1th FC Nuremberg) were also smiling after a mistake at the very beginning that could be disastrous.
Peter Chech's 9-minute return, thanks to the instant reflex, prevented the potential autogol of Thomas Sivok.
The best chance in Montenegro was when the duet of Stephen Jovetic and Dejan Damianovic were on the field.
Damianovic hit the end of the crime scene at 40 minutes, and he barely hit the Cheho goal.
After the break-in, she saved a world-class Czech golfer already in touch after FK Seoul left the field for 50 minutes.
The winner's goal was killed just before the final whistle.
Turkey did not enjoy football in Zagreb at the time.
Four days after winning 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play better than destroying 0:0 in Zagreb.
While there is no doubt that coach Gus Hidddink will now release the team's ski team to third place in 2002, the Croatians are the fourth in the final round of the European Championship.
Turks have almost perfected 31,000 spectators at Maximir Stadium.
Seljuk Inana's long strike at the seventh minute stopped, and the attacker Kazim was unable to turn the ball off the net.
Croatia then woke up and took control of the game more and more.
After the interruption, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
The legionnaires of the Bundesligi Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukic of the Wolfsburg team, who took over Ivana Perishic of Dortmund at 62 minutes.
Trapattoni is going to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro departure after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already looked confident in its place after winning 4:0 in the first phase, took the lead for the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Constantine Vasilev from the guest team compared the account at 57 minutes.
Ireland took a good pace from the beginning, but only at the 23rd minute Robbie Kin from Los Angeles made the first clean head shot.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender could not have allowed him to bring Ireland forward.
The goal was killed in 32 minutes.
As Paul Londak’s golf team was protected, Ward went to the right place and, leaving the ball through the line, changed his account at 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of employees in China over the next few years.
The company listed Dax reported on Thursday that it is going to invest about two billion dollars by 2015 (about 1.5 billion euros).
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people," said Bill McDermott, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The state of 2500 has to grow to 4500.
The world leader of the industrial software market plans to double the number of offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chandu and Daljan.

"Now we want to change the scale of our operations," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China."
Mass killings - human dimension
An exciting and very good new book by Peter Engunda "The Beauty and Grief: The Personal History of the First World War" begins with a long list of active people whose heart dies.
Here is the advice as to how to read: Cut this page out carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Anglond's presentation, and this list of active persons will be your GPS, your bait, when, like one of these men and women, you will get out of the way and lose yourself in the dark of war.
Mr. England is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, who is awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he wrote now -- unusually, he describes it, quite precisely, as an anti-history work.
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, journalists or discussions of tactics and war technology.
It's not as much a book as it was -- it explains how much "the book about what it looked like." It's about " feelings, impressions, feelings and state of mind."
The book Crassota and Grief has combined the experiences of more or less undetectable men and women over the 20 years, from both sides of the front line, from school students and botanists to alpineists, doctors, early-help drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone falls into prison, loses his hand or his leg, comes out of his mind or dies.
Their lives die here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some will be destroyed at this time.
Mr. England's book is a departure from the historical book standard.
This is an amendment to the assumption that the First World War was only a serious war in the West Front.
"Crazy and Grief" is well-known for other theatres of military action: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
There are bees in this book; one of them will meet Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is the flies of the cesium.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people, like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, who smells of smokeless dust.
When the cannon is nearby, and you're a woman and you're at home with your children, will you stay or flee?
Anyway, who's going to do this?
Almost nobody understands what's going on and why we have to fight this war at all.
"The lack of facts," notes Mr. Englund, "is filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, compelling ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and hearings."
"Crazy and Grief" follows the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German Navy sailor.
Their stories were taken mainly from memoirs, letters, and other material that had already been published.
The stories about their lives may be horrendous or fascinating, but they are, to a large extent, alive because of the small moments and the fragmented details gathered by Mr. England.
Many of them are about deprivation and how they deal with them.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzaz, there's an Erzaz."
"Foreign coffee, false aluminum, unsweetened resin, paper binders, wooden puddles."
He continued to tell about the footpath in Germany.
It describes "the meat of pressed rice mixed with fat (and decorated with fake bone made from wood); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes; footwear covered with wood".
It notes that there were "837 registered substitutes for meat authorised to produce sausages, 511 registered substitutes for coffee".
Some of the stories relate to honor and courage.
One American observes the burden of cruelty in himself and says about war: "You feel that, at the end of the day, this is what men were created for instead of sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or bestsellers and claiming that this show is civilization, and under your finely trimmed sleeves, there is no barbarity."
The British soldier, on the other hand, notices that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or be grieved.
"When a person is calm about self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen before the public," he writes.
But it's, on the other hand, awfully like a convicted man who's been hanging out in secret.
Other comments concern an old Europe that is being demolished and new forms of fear.
"The conflict has become an increasingly economic competition," writes Mr. England, "a war plant".
He notes the coming of what he calls "a new species in the beast of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a good shrill suit that sets a cut, sitting behind a written table".
People are unforeseeable: low-level actions are as much heroism as they are.
Mr. Anglond told of soldiers who were trying to lure out of prostitutes a venereal disease in order to avoid service on the front.
"The only gruesome expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea, which soldiers have bought and slaughtered themselves in the genitals in the hope of entering a hospital," he writes.
"All the desperate people threw him in the eye, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated by Swedish Peter Gravez for Mr. Engunda's flexible, but nebroic, very suitable for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war has “freed completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People start asking why their leaders make them fight.
The best books on the 1st World War were often undirected, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassela or by such novels as "On the West Front Without Change" by Erika-Marie Remark, not exaggerating historical works.
Mr. England's book is part of this untempered pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final, which I can remember in unscrupulous literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he got out of the book to the page with a list of characters, pulled it out of your hands, and burned it with a spear.
After the previous error - carefully calculated
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because at Zukotti Park at that time there must have been fewer people.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others said they were going to school.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of events, and his presence emphasized the importance of the operations of the Department of Police.
There could be no repetition of such episodes over the past few weeks as the use of gas against protestors, which was contrary to the Department ' s rules and caused a storm of sympathy for the public to the occupying.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to free the Zukotti Park protests began.
The authorities were prepared to watch the occupations unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis studies were conducted on Randells Island, calculated on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called trainings in the case of riots - counter-terrorism measures that allow for the rapid movement of a large number of police - with the exception of Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place in the evening on Monday on the east-river Manhattan side.
The order to enter the park came in the last minute, and told the source known as the order in which the order was referred only to as "training".
"There's a couple of cops that I know and called on this case, they didn't say they were sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who was talking about anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was a lesson that taught the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clean up the park, but they withdrew from hundreds of protestors who had slipped inside before the appointed time, hearing about these plans.
On Tuesday, staff from various police units, including the district forces, were involved in the operation, which were usually used to control the crime zone.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like work, come and leave the park during the day, which makes 1 hour of the night suitable for arrival.
"It was right to do this when the park was the least of the people," he said.
The search engines and loudspeakers were assembled at Pike-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt-Drive, around the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The projector and the earlier written announcements made by loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protestors.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue winds, many protestors simply gathered their things and left.
The police reported that the camps did not touch up to 1:45 at night, giving the protest time to collect things.
Other police groups, according to the testimony of the witnesses, gathered on the perimeter to enter if the park needed arrests.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, head of the Department of Police, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they have not been allowed to see how the police are doing and that the police have treated them cruelly.
Mr. Brown said that cameras on Church Street, along the west border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through the chest of personal protests, including bags, plastic covers and polyethylene bags, full of clothes, the Department of Health teams followed her by collecting what had been thrown away.
Some protestors who refused to leave, pulled out, soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protestors took positions near the kitchen camp at the park center.
Some built barricades, and the police came inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter were shaking their hands together.
And two people came to the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
In order to cut the locks, rescue officers were called up.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “infringement of public order and resistance in detention”, he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, Head of Department and Senior Officer of the Department, was the highest-ranking officer in the field.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department's investigation police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "did not manage the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, if necessary.
The fences were located in Cortland Street, in the neighborhood north of the park, and in Pine Street, in the neighborhood south.
Observers saw the police extend the perimeter even further beyond the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, pushing people further.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. to the south of Pine Street, one of the protestors jumped onto the roof of the police car, while others said that they had aired the rails of the police van.
At some point in the crowd, he flew a piece of fire.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
A trade union serving school staff will take the city to court for dismissal
The trade union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to bring them to court on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students are taught.
The trial is probably the last means available to the trade union of the District Council 37 seeking to abolish dismissal.
Sixty-two school assistants, coordinator of work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October, as trade union leaders called their political response to their refusal to give the city access to health funds managed by working groups to close the gap in the budget last spring.
The city officials categorically rejected this charge.
At the City Council hearings last month, the Chancellor of the School, Dennis M. Walcott, said that discharges were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members spoke to him, saying that there was no indication in the budget that school support staff would be fired.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had submitted claims by warning the Department of Education that a complaint had been filed against it; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal application to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of Urban Education will be referred to as respondents and eight temporary workers are listed as claimants, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the legal department of the city, said that the city had not seen a quack and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint under New York Times, the trade union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He said that while there was no dismissal in Staten Island and there were few in the schools of Upper East Side or Tribbeki, 17 school supporters lost their seats in the 23rd district of Brunsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to the 8th and 9th districts of South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working in free high school 36 in Garlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim is: “These are not areas of stable parents who can find money to fill budget failures”.
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the method of calculating additional funding for each poor student who attends school.
The trade union also claims that the school director could be misled by the language of the notification allowing the dismissal of coordinators from working with parents.
The notice used the word “exceeding” although “exceeding” is more often used when a teacher from the school’s payroll is moved to the list of employees who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators of work with parents were fired," says the black man, "and not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress is ready for the Libya Agreement
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was to succeed in the fight, the former dictator Muamar Qaddafi was arrested and killed, and American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider a resolution issued by President John Kerry (democratic, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McKayin (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who commends the Libyans for their successful resurrection and the American army for their "revenge".
"The meaning of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"This is a confirmation of their democratic aspirations by both parties."
The language may seem harmless, but no further discussion on Libya has taken place.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the US Army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McKain introduced a resolution allowing limited use of the American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the two parties and did not vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also did not support the proposal to cut the financing of the US operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in some kind of legislative cleansing - when Congress is angry enough to criticise Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad to actually kick the ground out of her feet.
Then, events took on the indecisiveness of the Congress
In August Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and Kaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “is admired by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and unconventional persistence in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council, or will lawmakers emerge as a June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republic of the Committee, addressed the latest version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Chamber's Chapter should vote this week for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure proposed by a member of the House of Representatives Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other amendment to the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators had not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they had not tried.
The amendment of Goodlat is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that concern a wide range of issues that have been raised in this constituencies.
Some have doubled - the same bill has been passed to the House of Representatives and the Senate - and others have been minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and several more on “Federal Expenditure Control”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors, mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their abstracts, the opportunity to boast that they have "extended" such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which took place in August, required the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wish to limit the number of terms of office of members of the Congress, while a member of the Chamber of Representatives of José Serrano (democratic, New York) wishes to abolish the two terms of office for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson-younger (Democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
The amendment banning unilateral marriages has been proposed for many years, as well as for another banning the burning of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to permit the abolition of federal laws if they object to them by two thirds of the States.
As members of the Congress have endeavoured to propose amendments, they are moving no faster than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and at 110th, they introduced 66.
This rate would be considered compared to the early 1990s when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But their success was no more than it is now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced to Congress in 1789.
"Awake, but not sure," said Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday evening, sang a melody from the "Solnce Returns Tomorrow" boat show, and said that he wanted to recover more than to return to Congress.
As E-by-si News appeared on the 20/20 programme with Diane Sawyer, Giffords worked hard to formulate proposals and needed help in walking.
The program showed her difficult path of recovery after the trauma caused by the pull, which broke the skull and broke the left side of the brain from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the Chamber of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill of limitation.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13 people, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang, and called his healing “hard”.
To the question of Sawyer, how does she feel, 41-year-old Giffords said, "I'm fine."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 special edition, which was shown in advance of the release of the new book of couples "The History of Courage and Hope".
The Special Representative described the recovery of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
On a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a head and a long scarf on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we saw Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and the physiotherapists were teaching her how to do simple things.
Swallow your head.
Put your lips out.
And then her first word, "what."
A few days later, Giffords made the second word "tooth", asking for a change in the menu tomorrow.
The video shown by E-bi shows that music played a central role in the healing of Giffords: we see the congressman singing along with the doctors "The Girls Just Want to Have Fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, he said he wouldn't remember the day of the trial.
Her husband told her that he was reading the Giffords article in the March 12 shooting newspaper, when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected attacker Gerd Li Lafner is in Missouri prison and is being subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Burst, heavy, heavy."
Once when she was cured, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm sure."
"And I said, "Habby, you're not sure," said Kelly.
You're just beat.
And you're going through it, you're going to get better and back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more sad than respect
The event was a festival at Wall Street, which collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock played a ballad about helplessness, disappointments and losses.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and sailors were reportedly built around him.
The audience in the smokings applauded him standing there.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Zaltzman, who organized the spring collection of money.
The senior military officer at the concert, at which he was also chaired by the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the troops in the other.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the army and often an equal, sometimes admired American audience.
The troops are filled with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praisers have their price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were a pity for people in the form of others.
"We are not victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who ordered the troops in Iraq and was soon leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unfortunate."
This is a sensitive theme for military leaders who do not want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger of the returning troops in recent years has been much worse in Vietnam.
As a result, most of the mourning talks are conducted quietly and only among the war veterans.
After his two sons had returned from fighting in the navy, Colonel Mark Kenshan had warned them that people would not be seen in the army from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration, for they have plundered the rebels and were in exotic places.
Others will wonder if "the masked evil veteran is hiding," said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to high government office in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said he felt that some of the interviewers had been cautiously asked if he would be able to withstand the stress of responsible work in Washington immediately after the war.
Kenshn remembers saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to expect a negative effect."
The unrest experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Victory in the field of fighting is rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefits from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as usual in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Bernow, who led US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the depth of the military's suffering.
The troops estimate the number of returns they have made, the number of friends they have lost, or the level of losses they have lost.
The army is faced with increasing pressure from the anti-violence supporters
This week, historical court hearings should decide whether 28 men and women would be charged with rape charges against the army.
If not, hundreds of claimants will be able to do the following.
Elizabeth Lyman, a 25-year-old and 11-week-old, was reportedly raped by her partner at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner with another, and met a male attendant carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But Tessa's grandson took her fears away.
I thought, "No, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instincts then."
A few minutes after they entered the Lyman room, the man came behind her, fell down and raped, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be anxious to wait for the court's decisions at a historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether they will go to the court of appeal that they have filed against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld.
The claim claims that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The claim filed in February by counsel Susan Berk of Washington, D.C. originally included 17 claimants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming that they had been raped or threatened by employees and that the army had not properly investigated, prosecuted or had not provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Berk says she's focused on the top of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Berk also said that she had contacted about 400 other victims in February, many of whom could participate in future demands.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the claimants in this case -- putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak -- it will open up a lot of cases if it is necessary to support pressure.
The Defence Department's defence team, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil McBrayda, has taken steps to put an end to the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a strategy of protection, mainly based on the fact that ex-military or current soldiers are unable to make claims by the army for the damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine of the Supreme Court of 1950, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk posed by the military service of the claimants”, the document states.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in the war, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear frontline.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the area of combat.
The result: 150 women soldiers were killed between the two wars, two thirds of them in the battle.
It is also time for the armies to become modern, says Berk.
She is not alone in her fight; in addition to her request, three others are ready.
In the Yel Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar prepares a case against the four largest military academys in charge of promoting the female hate atmosphere.
The separate non-commercial association of American veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a complaint against the army, where the diagnosis of “change of personality” is being made to victims of violence to eliminate them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagvati from the human rights group Organization of Action for Women Military Workers.
Her group filed a complaint against the Office of Veterans in December, accusing her of discriminatory treatment of people who claimed that sexual violence had been threatened during the service.
Nine separate draft laws proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, the Department of Traffic Prevention and Sexual Violence reported 3,158 rape attempts.
However, it is known that the attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon ' s own estimates, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases were brought before the court - twice as much as in the civil justice system.
In Berk's case, they only call them the first in a number of other traumas.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to report details of rape to the police, doctors and commanders 11 times.
She collected a set of rape evidence, and the blood of the attacker, from the cut in his hand, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge during which she was asked if she had had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive profile to the accused, who was finally justified.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was a rose now - I escaped from the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't a court over him, it was a court against me."
Lyman was asked to contact a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed her personality change, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released with an unfavourable language, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
If the case is brought forward by Lyman and his companions on appeal, it is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at the University of Washington.
But he says, "I think they're going forward."
The doctrine that has been criticised since it came into existence stands between them and the verdict.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Ferrez for my whole life.
The army has stayed for decades because it does not have the incentives and restraints that impose responsibility.
He adds, "A lot of odds against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when ordinary people want to fight.
If the hearing is not for their benefit, Berk, the complainant's lawyer, will collect hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform is complete," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
The wall has eyes: How the researchers are studying you in Facebook
Before becoming a new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was an ordinary guy who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who was aware of the massive killing in Norway in July, who had killed 77 people, attended his first open trial.
Although Bravik was able to act alone, he was far from alone in the network: he spent a lot of time preparing for an attack on his computer, along with millions of nationalists who supported the right groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy to go to Facebook.
"We understood that it was not difficult to improve," said Jamie Bartlett, the author of the recently published report on European cyber-popularism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The storage of personal data in Facebook is so great, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use an advertising tool on the site to assign the necessary population group with scientific accuracy - that marketing scientists have been doing so for several years.
The Bartletta team found half a million right-wing fans all over Europe and then pushed them into advertising, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the advertisement offered the user an inquiry into their level of education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants were able to consult 14 parties of extreme legal rights in 11 European countries, even without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some results are not as bad as online right-wing online, most of which are young men of the sex, with insufficient immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just walk behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and politikologists use the site to study the world's health issues to social trends, which are expressed in Lakes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding an average of three records a day, the "super-current information" Facebook is a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles called the website by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook will be able to explore people who cannot be reached on the road with the block.
"Before, if you wanted to ask people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join the party, and they would never accept you," Bartlett said.
"The Facebook excludes all of this - you're addressing them directly."
Others say that this site could identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who had discussed their drinking habits in Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than those who had been silent about it.
Moreno assumes that students' peers, such as their resident teachers, could monitor the site and interfere to help a student who is too often updating drunk status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author Moreno and Director of the Centre for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify children from a risk group that they would otherwise not find."
Facebook is also constantly collecting a variety of data about its users.
The Data Management Group processed the statistics on the relationship and day of St. Valentine's Day, the appearance of voters in the mid-2010 period, and the National Happiness Index (mainly using the information available to them, the cyber-freedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that they like it or not - in exchange for the possibility of playing in Scrabble with someone in thousands of miles of you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for offline research, online data is generally available.
"I don't think many users have even thought that the researcher could observe their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about the study he conducted in 2006 using the public accessible pages of students in Facebook.
"The way they imagined it, it was just between them and their friends."
Then there is a question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the research facility is extremely honest.
It is not possible to know the number of information in the profile and on the user's page.
"What you're saying in Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook is two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite the years of his work in the field of technological research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and the handbook are still the best research tools from those that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the entry into real peace and communication with real people," he said.
"Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social is still going offline."
"Frozen and Inhuman": Anders Bering Bravik will be brought before the court for the first time
Anders Bering Bravik, a man who was aware of the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during the first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Riczar of the Tampleiers of Norway," he said before 500 in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I don't admit my guilt."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Bravik an opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik, who had brought a written statement with him, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to detain Bravik for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some were hoping to see Bravik in the eye, others were convinced that he was under the lock.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors of Uttoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but I got a little easier myself after seeing and hearing the suspect."
The black suit and blue tie Bravik remained calm and professionalism throughout the entire hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors when he came in and out of the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea that he was part of a major resistance movement, the judge decided that he was not mistaken and said that there was no evidence that he was working with the partners.
Some may be relieved by the fact that the attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But it doesn't automatically reduce the pain and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but it's not like that," said one victim's relative.
"It'd be a lot easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview showing at the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Designer of Modernity.
But the fact that Apple fans can count the biggest opening in a recently re-discovered interview, which they recalled in advance of the preliminary demonstrations in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind was perceived in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and a hippie, but he was also a satisfactory organizer and a modernist of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from “the ill idea that a really big idea is 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea from a large product separates a huge amount of expertise”.
Back in 1995, Bob Cringley created the Triumph Nerves teleserial about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more time with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he was already working in his new NeXT computer company in expectation of mass Internet development.
When a small part of the Kringley interview was used in Nerdha, he said that the original interview was missing while transporting.
Only after Jobs died was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly edited, became the basis for a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview that takes place in Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred for detailed interviews, Jobs here seems to be reluctant to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And I can't believe I'm thinking.
At four different moments during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers - reflections in 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more accurately.
There are also moments when perfectionism of Jobs goes out on the surface, where he seems upset with Kringla's issues, which make him move more quickly to issues or events of greater importance.
In the withdrawal before the era of Pixara, the iPods and the iPhones, there is something more vicious than a prophetic interview, when Jobs assesses that he sees that various companies do what is right and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technologies.
One thing is to read about Job's postmortem evaluations, but there's something early and inspiring in Job's, which we see here, a alarming dreamer at the threshold of magnitude.
He has a vision of what things could and should have been.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of seven significant conclusions of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you're getting are, "Oh, that's just how it is done."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks of business very deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continued to describe his efforts to rationalize reporting in Apple.
It was designed to record costs often from “standard costs”, which were taken from the bottom and then driven by “cleaning” and created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business costs even to the bottom.
About the joke over the Pope:
Jobs tells us in detail about the blue box, which he bottled with Steve Voznjak, a device that enabled people to effectively break up a telephone company and call for a long distance free of charge.
They wrote a lot about the device before, but Job's affair here, describing the blue box as an act of authority being contagious.
He tells how he and Voznjak tested the box using a phone-automat, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've captured the Earth's layer of half-life once, and you've been screaming in a phone machine, and it's a minute later in a neighbor's phone machine," said Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we took is that we could chew something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could chew on a little thing that could control a lot of things -- that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple could ever show up without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one well-known outcome that he and Voznjak have practically managed, calling the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and calling on the Pope's phone, trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called up at night to talk to the American diplomat, the two met with a laugh just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold reputation of Bill Heulett):
When he was 12 years old, he was hunting for spare parts to collect a frequency meter, and he found Bill Heulette in his phone book and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer subscription to Heulette Packard.
"It had a strong effect on me, it was the only company I saw at the age, and it formed my view of what such company is and how well they are with their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP personnel who visited research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer".
He was the size of a chest, he had a little monitor with an electronic tube, and I fell in love with him.
I often rode in the HP as a teenager and turned around the car and wrote a program for her.
About improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs interviewed about the invention of new products on the flight.
When he went out to sell a hard-load of mounting plates, a buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working 30 days in credit, he had to think about both the collection and the delivery of ready devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the fierce disputes... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to collect the mouse that would cost $300], and I was stuck in the throat, and I went out and found the designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About large energy-loss companies:
Long before he led Apple's reinstatement, Jobs had just predicted that many leaders had failed to see the situation and had lost control of their market share.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're doing a better copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any better.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [these types of people] who eventually lead companies, and people making products are forced out of decision-making areas.
The winning product, which has led to this monopolistic position, is being driven out by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times more, he could be a 90x Microsoft...
They've been defeated.
About innovation as an art form:
"A great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of expertise ... when you distort a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll know a lot about her thinness.
There are compromises that you need to go to - some things you can't make you do electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts, bringing them together...
In the end, everything is being tasted -- everything is trying to express itself in the best way that people have ever produced, and then it's trying to get it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always had a hard time grasping big ideas.
Part of what was done by famous Macintosh was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, and historians who became the best information technology specialists in the world.
If not information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are lunching with opponents of the Health Act while the court is considering the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the political issue, would it listen to the withdrawal of President Obama's health law, his two judges, Antonina Skalia and Clarence Thomas, honoring the lunch sponsored by the legal firm that would contest the case before the Supreme Court?
This case occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One case on the agenda was an application supported by 26 states contesting the urgent health review adopted by the Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists from all over the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, the reverse debate is expected at 5 1/2 hours in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be a stir in the presidential race, which will be the worst by the time the trial is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law must be abolished will probably be Paul Clement, who was deputy Attorney General during the presidency of George V. Bush.
The Legal firm Clementa, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped to sponsor the annual lunch of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that consistently advocates conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who had a huge financial interest in the weight.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court meeting on the case.
He attended, among other things, Mitch McConnell, a leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a well-known opposer of the Health Act.
The first guests for lunch?
Nothing new: two judges have been visiting the Federalist Society for many years.
And that doesn't go against ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were obedient, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which reads: “The judge may visit the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, a guest or a reference in the programme of such activities”.
However, the clear proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with high financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
"This flagrant violation of the ethics and independence of the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"Judges have been drinking and eating at the official action to collect money with lawyers whose cases are now being handled in court."
Their appearance and assistance in the collection of money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly draw attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with groups of the kind of federalist community.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a famous conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the court level of the first instruction.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to listen to the case because she was too involved in the protection of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record 18 billion aircraft order
The Emirates air company orders 50 broad-fission liners Boeing 777 and maybe 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a transaction size of over $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its production.
But this is an important event when this company is the aircraft builder Boeing Co., and the pre-currency price for all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
So important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing golden life of future orders on aircraft.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced in these outputs its largest dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 Boeing 777 two-pass aircraft.
An incredible order was received from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total pre-supply price to $26 billion, Boeing said at Dubai Airshow 2011.
Later Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliner, which could be welcomed by a much better fuel economy and passenger convenience.
The surplus price for six aircraft is over $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said an analyst Morningstar Neil Dior.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many near-east airlines own oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but also the increase in fuel prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of the largest items of expenditure, is not so much a waste, as the country is making money at high oil prices.
This is important, because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the order when prices increase, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Order of Emirates reinforces Boeing's leadership in the market for large-scale fluctuating aircraft and helps to prevent the Airbus SAS opponent from attempting to reach his dominance with his A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory on the plane took place four months later, after Airbus stated that he would postpone the biggest A350 debut, which competed with only once from 777-300ER.
He postponed the duty to increase the axle load after the buyers had required to increase the load capacity and the length of the flight.
Boeing Co shares grew by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister obviously lost her election in Michoacane
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers helped the opposition of Fausto Valeho from the IRP in the pre-election race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderona did not appear to have made her application to the place of Governor Michoacán during a severe public election, and she said Monday that drug dealers had helped to remove the race for one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Valeho, a leader of the Western governor's race, or the IRP, is known as Fausto Valeho.
"Intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming not only for Michoakana but also for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview for the next day after the resurrection.
"They scared our candidates, our employees in the elections... they caught the polls, they put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
IRP managed Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
It prepares for return, and victory in Michoacane is an important step in this attempt.
IRP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valeho seems to have just a little bit of the Kalderon who led the ratings to the day of the elections.
Kalderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or the PND, led by her brother, refused to recognize Valeho as the winner.
Sylvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP, which now belongs to the governor's chair, has suffered a third - serious defeat for the separated and unsuccessful left in front of the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Valeho, the former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denied contact with drug dealers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacane, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines have been dominated for a long time.
This is the native state of President Calderon, and he selected Michoakan to launch a military operation against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the elections, when he was running for Louis Maria Kalderon, and several candidates left the local election race for fear.
For the IRP, however, as terrible as the elections in Michoacan look, victory will be the driving impulse of the party.
The man who was supposed to represent the IPR in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valecho and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the foreword of next year."
ABR persuades Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank forced India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ABR Office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economies should "do all they can" to speed up the recovery of the currency block by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that BRIC countries were looking at the difficulties of Europe “indiscriminately”, and said that Asian financial assistance on the side of European leadership and resources could help to avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"We're all involved."
"That's why anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he reported in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian loan funds have grown threatening, and the prime ministers, both Italy and Greece, have resigned.
The developing debt crisis in Europe gave rise to fears that it could bring the world economy back to recession and brought the leading developing economies together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nage predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through the IMF, but said bilateral cooperation -- a kind of purchase of the EU financial assistance fund, a means of ensuring financial stability in Europe -- would give great force to Asian partners in Europe's negotiations.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decrease in exports and a reduction in foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others claim that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Varshni, professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said that it would be very difficult from a political point of view to provide assistance to Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, of whom around 800 million live for 2 dollars a day or less.
"At some point, they'll know that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to sea holidays, and that's not going to be a good idea," he said.
Li Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis was threatening “significant direct effects” throughout Asia.
ABR's forecast of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced “degradable risks” due to threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to develop "emergency plans" to protect themselves from the fall and significant flows of capital from their economies.
Pentagon ' s terrible warnings of potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence Leon Panetta called for an environment Monday at the Congress, warning that the expected automatic cuts in the budget would undermine national security and call for a financial chain response from the Pentagon corridors to the fighting fields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already experiencing a decrease of $450 billion in the coming decade, but is now afraid that additional reductions of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if the congress is unable to reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the ministry," Panette told the senators of the Republic of John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of the Congress to accept the budget agreement and resulting from the so-called sequestration initiated a total reduction of 23 per cent and the termination of many new projects.
"This severe reduction, which is so thoughtless, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and will seriously damage other attempts to modernize," Panette wrote to senators.
"We will also have to release many of our staff and, as a reduction will be made so quickly, we will probably have to release the staff to reach the goal."
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and cause serious damage to the military."
The reductions will eventually affect the military," Panetta said.
"While military funding in foreign emergency operations has not been directly affected by sequencing, military achievements have been seriously affected by the serious collapse in the core budgets," warned Panetta.
"Contract staff will be reduced by the end of the cancelled contracts and the supervisory treaty that supports the military."
“State personnel will be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
"As a result of the sequestration in the Ministry of Defence, the United States will be quickly defeated as the world's leading military power."
"We are constantly opposed to these draconian actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening, when they published the letter of the Panette.
"It's not the exit we can live with, and it's not the exit that we have to commit."
"Secvester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, which cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether the letter of the Panel or the recent warnings of senators to the budgetary compromise or the calls for the release of the Pentagon from reductions will be seen later.
The Panel was absolutely sincere about possible reductions, although it had been working in the Pentagon's leadership for many years after carrying out budget expertise at Congress and the White House and realizing that it was facing a difficult choice.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a thorough picture of what could follow -- an army with no shell but no kernels.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a team without a bullet."
"It's a wing of a plane without enough trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening remarks in the Pentagon.
"This force, which suffers from an unsustainable spirit of war, ill will and is unable to fight against potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to its letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, the new details of how the reductions “provided significant operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limiting our ability to be the first in deployment and in response to the world’s challenges; and leading to unacceptable risks in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that had already been tested, and some only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 impactor, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground-based vehicle that the Army and the Marine Pechott need to replace the lobster.
The further development and testing of F35 can save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and resist potential threats to China and other opponents.
How to Get Over Lies
The runaway view of the last headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
The candidate for presidents of the Republics of Herman Kane is involved in questioning the sexual harassment charges against several women; each party accuses the other in a lie.
The Administration of the University of Pennsylvania had been charged with false testimony, since they allegedly concealed that the retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nikola Sarkozy was caught when he told the US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroys careers and crushes countries.
The Congressman of New York and Internet Exhibitor Anthony Weiner turned out to be a fool, denying his departures, which was quickly contradicted by irrevocable evidence.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was charged with financial crafts during a campaign to cover out-of-marrying.
And again, none of those living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
The story of fraud in school and college exams is a normal matter.
There have been cases when teachers responded to the tests in order to have a good evaluation of the results of their activities.
Teachers who must teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we deal with?
In one day, as research shows, you can lie between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of each other’s acquaintance.
The identification of a lie or a lie is a necessary skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, like, say, the charades where it is necessary to call "accused!", the discovery of a lie is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the last six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physiology.
One result of the study was that most of the old myths about the lie were dissolved.
Lies are looking in the eye.
They don't always stop, they're staring, they're red or they're sweating.
It is not appropriate to conclude that it is difficult for liars to see and expose.
The experienced teller of the lie can come to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the myth, the structure of issues and the temporary characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a wide and constantly growing segment of knowledge of the lie, and it is clear that finding a lie is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to guide in our difficult world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are better able to read to others, make them feel uncompromising, manage their own emotions, and feel intuitively how others view them.
We know from the study that extraterrestrials are more often than introverts, that men are more liars about themselves, while women are about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people are less vicious to their partners than non-wifery (but also the lie that they say, most often infrequently).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
What do you mean, someone's lying?
First, watch your object's behavior.
It's called the "determining of the baseline."
This helps to ensure a starting point for further assessment of changes.
Watch for the loan, the smile, the voting features of your object.
It is good to know if a person is always stabbing his feet in a normal way, then you will not be making unfair accusations when you see a stabbing in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for a group of misleading verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Swindlers can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their steps towards the door, turn to the exit, change their poses in a certain way, or demonstrate "relief after interview" -- this excessive breath of relief and change of the post when all the difficult questions are behind.
The investigators often falsify the exit signal to simply look at the relief after the interview.
So pay attention to your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson withdrew and used his time to claim that his dead wife was alive, which led to her search throughout the country.
Privatized people may also use distance to say, "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski" or to repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely caught.
Someone can use a "qualification language" when they answer the difficult question, "Well... I'm telling you the truth... how much I know... how much I know."
This makes the response more emotional than actually, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to identify a lie, but it is possible to possess the ability to detect a lie.
These skills will increase the chances for everyone not to be a victim of professional and personal experience.
The dispute plan for the construction of the pipeline needs to be reviewed after the US threat to postpone its approval
A few days later, after Obama's administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- calling for the wrath of trade unions, but calming the environmental defenders -- the company that is going to build the pipeline, claims that it will be willing to revise the project to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive sand dunes in Nebraska and be sure that the project would still be approved.
The company sounded this decision at a press conference in the state of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbass, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for oil pipelines, although with another route.
This follows a statement by the State Department last week that it will postpone a federal-level decision until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Pescan hills and the Ogalala aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News congressman Li Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise requested by the State Department is likely to give way to decision-making by 2013, after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that policy was involved in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama called for a decision by the State Department and expressed support for it.
The oil pipeline shall be 1,700 miles long from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Albert Province to oil stations in Texas.
To accomplish this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by trade unions, which expect about 20,000 oil pipeline-related jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers, who object to the plan, are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Holms area and the Ogalala Aquafer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study by the State Department of Environmental Impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry said that the Department ' s audit had commissioned a separate review process experience focusing on two issues.
One is a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a advisor to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was the choice of a firm that was hired to conduct an initial study that was inappropriate because it was related to TransCanada.
Patty LaBell was tried for allegedly causing the child a feeling of fear
The New York family argues that Patty LaBell's disco-device began to grow up in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their little daughter to the extent that she was afraid of it.
"Lady Marmalade" bullied 18-month-old Geneva Monk so badly that she carried on "a change of personality, disorder of sleep" and "a strong fear of strangers," says her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on 10 November last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, an educator at the kindergarten, Rosanna, and Geneva were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was hunting the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside with their luggage, carrying Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped at the door and dropped her daughter half a minute.
"Someone came back to me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell had a hard time making an excuse for a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosan Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to use abuses -- the word for C and the word for F -- in increased tone ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started to pour water out of a bottle on me.
She said that Geneva had an affair.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBell went to the mother -- who was still holding Geneva -- and her escorts had to hold her and get her into the waiting car, Rosann Monk said.
The little girl cried so much that she was dry, she added.
Later, the family sent a note of apology to LaBell, but did not receive an answer.
Lawyers and representatives of LaBell are not responsible for the comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family was planning to make any money that would benefit children with cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBell take responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially with regard to a child with an 18-month-old child on his hands."
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez's rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased, foreign funding decreased, and the economy was weakened.
The year 2011 will come in the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdes, also known as the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but a decline in the basic economic development indicators has been recorded.
Low temperatures in February not only led to millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth potential of the public economy by reducing economic activity by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, affecting the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by frost provided by the Mexico Council on Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, 78.03 per cent of which had been completely affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent had been partially affected.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, in the first three quarters of the country, an accelerated increase in unemployment between January and March 55,053 of the population of Sinaloa was unemployed, of 4.53 per cent of the population in the second quarter, the percentage increased to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, which in the census of more than 74,000 people living in Sinaloa, an increase of 18,969 compared to the first half of the population.
Liquidity reduction
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa over the year is covered by many factors, for economist Gerardo Lopes Servantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions undertaken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which relates to several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market, in order to limit the resources imposed by the law that was adopted at the Congress to fight money-laundering, because people who have illegal dollars are simply working with them, investing them and using them in something," he said.
Fixed immigration
Lopes Servantes said there is still a demographic factor in unemployment growth.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily due to the difficulties of entry, and in the second, since, once they have gone, they are already experiencing a lot of difficulties in finding work, so the group of people remains and demands jobs here in the state as a result of increasing unemployment," he said.
Violations of formal requirements
The analysis of Sinaloa's labour market is worse if the large number of violations that prevail under the labour conditions is reported to be 60.38 per cent of the state ' s active population, without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and abuses in the formulation, another reminder of work in the state is provided with low wages; in the state the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute for Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos by September, much below the national average, of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest flow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 from January to July, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development has recorded a total of 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mainly came from service companies.
Long
In the light of the economic downturn, in July, the Government requested the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, a total of 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives in the first year of the Government, Mario Lopez Valdes demonstrated a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo Lopes, President of the National Chamber of Industry, said that during 2011, there was no agreement on the wishes of the various sectors, including the Government alone.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa was really low this year, it has to work a lot to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezes had stopped the state's economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
"The low levels of the economy are the result of several events, including the cold, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which is not becoming fast enough to create an economic dynamic, which allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it down to our expectations," he said.
Revision of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state should continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on it, we believe that a long-term programme that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state must be mobilized by all the material and human resources that are in Sinaloa," he said.
Future work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction to better direct the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, but there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own manner in the conduct of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to get involved in work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's sentenced to 20 pounds [8 kg] of marijuana
Five years of prison and a 100-day income fine, such a sentence was imposed on the citizen of Naples for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valensuel Sandoval, convicted of a health crime, had in this case stored marijuana for distribution.
According to case AP/SIN/CLN 687/2010/MI, Valencia Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling the street of Cyprus Valdes, at post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the white truck, where he carried a bag of black bags in the car, and on the passenger seat was a small backpack, where soldiers found eight pounds [8 kg] and 23 grams [23 grams] of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detention was handed over to the Second District Court, and the accused continued to remain in the Centre for the Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions to work
Public work related to programmes such as the Family, the Saving of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants is likely to remain uncompleted or long-term due to lack of funds, Miguel Ángel Lopes Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that although the work programmes had been developed so far, they were in danger because the Government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to over 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent had to be made by the state, and only the Federation and the Municipality had so far provided resources for work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year ends, they have not given us any digs when they had to give us a share from the beginning of July," he said, "to avoid delay, we have started work and they have moved a lot, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of the period of the administration of the municipality it had to make money to cover more than 7 million, which had not been provided by the State administration in that case.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial opportunities to participate, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to gain access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the state should remain," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to make delivery of these resources, he said that the request had been made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Vilareal, to increase efforts so that the percentages relating to them would come as soon as possible.
"They have to make almost 12 million, and even if the year is over, they haven't given us any digging."
The Court will approve "a digital television transition" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogue signals into digits is one of the most important changes that have been achieved in recent years.
The Supreme Court (VC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the Chamber against the presidential decree, which conveys the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required to cancel it.
A minority of the four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Sylvo Mess, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his mandate by issuing a decree detailing action for the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to express its constitutionality or non-constitutionality and remain in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Mr. Olgoi Sanchez Cordero, proposed that a decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme is a law enshrined in the law of the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanches Cordero voted for the project.
On this basis, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to challenge the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project ' s arguments that the federal executive authority could not determine the general rules for the measures to be prepared by the State administration.
"I also do not believe that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the governing body," and I recalled that the planning of public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive authority, which has a constitutional mandate, the government.
The substitution of analogue signals to digits - one of the most important changes in recent years - has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean the deferral of benefits from digital conversion, which includes meeting public needs, which not only has a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security”.
These issues, he said, “needs the work of the entire system established by the principle of public economic governance to include a group of authorities that the Constitution brings together into the State executive authority.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcast and had done so by means of the executive authority, despite the availability of additional technical facilities.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of the Congress, ensures administrative compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, said.
In Michoakana, they analyze the possibility of counting "vote"
According to data transmitted to the EPR, the difference between the first and second seats in the governorate elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total number of protocols 6.074.
The possibility of counting “voting” was real, as regards the electoral process in Michoakan this year, where, according to data from the Programme of Preliminary Results of Elections (PRS), the difference between the first and second seats in the governorate elections was only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total number of protocols 6.074.
In this light, the President of the General Council of the Miquelon Institute of Elections (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Ligneral Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps adopted a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As it should be recalled, Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law Act, as the Congress approved the reforms of the State shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoi Ringel did not include it in the publication of the law in the Official Journal of the State, stating that it had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (CJEU) decided on a constitutional claim issued by the local legislative assembly and called the “ineffective and illegal” vote of the representative of the State on constitutional reform, since he does not have the right to “resolve or support them”.
In an interview with the possibility of “voting” Maria de los Ángeles Lünderal, she argued that the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of VAT would make it possible for a partial or full count of votes to be taken by the local electoral authority.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more electives may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no protocol for voting and counting documents in the minutes or is not in the Chair; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all ballots may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the proposed candidate winner of the elections and those who have received a second vote is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or the coalition that has issued a second of those candidates.
The overall vote recalculation will also be made if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party to which the candidate took the second place, in the event of the exclusion of the electoral ballots that have been taken into account in the partial recalculation.
It should be noted that in this situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRSP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without considering 129 votes in the total number of Protocol 923.
His Last Will
His dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, the family confirms.
The rest of Felipe Basio Cortez's pilot arrived in Saltillo, his home town on Sunday evening; on Monday there was a visit and a relaxing meal.
According to the family, the Colonel's last will was to unload his dust in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After receiving condolences with other people who died in a disaster, Basio Cortez's family returned to Coauila capital on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony at Campo Marta.
In the afternoon, the Colonel’s dust arrived at an hour on Nazario Ortis Garcia’s bulwark, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., he attended the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school and football team colleagues, who was a member of Felipe Basio during high school education.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and for his dust to be spread in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she believed that he was at the edge of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother who was committed to his family."
Felipe Cortez Basio left the city of Saltillo to go to the Air College in Sapopan, Halisko.
Some did not believe him, they said that he had a head even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davil Basio, will remember him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him as he brought Marta Saagun to Saltillo."
He remembers that even when he was seven years old, he rode to Sappan for the graduation ceremony of his family's relatives, so he knows that his grandfather died, doing what he loved most in life: managing a plane.
It's being conducted in the last way.
The weapons were fired in honour of Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopes, the people of the village and the Government of the state, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the High School of Technology in Saltillo, in which he studied in 1985 and did his studies and in sport, conducted him in the last way.
Basio Cortez died recently when the helicopter he managed was violated, together with the Secretary of the Government of the Province, José Francisco Blake Moroy, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05 the remnants of Basio Cortez (creemed), the resident of Saltillo, arrived to be transferred to the funeral office of the members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martines, to the training school, where he was already waiting for his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies were found on the L.L. Cadreit farm
Within hours of the discovery of the military authorities, eleven people in the media were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in various parts of the body with a gunshot shot at a abandoned farm in the municipality of Kadereita Hymenez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was found at a distance of 1.5 km from the Kadereit road on the side of Santiago, at an altitude in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several passersby noticed that in the village house, the wall of which was decorated in a runaway and brown, the door was opened.
When they looked inside, literally three feet [3 m], they found the bodies of three men, and they immediately informed the authorities.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow football with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white mother.
Almost one metre was the body of another man, in the red robe and in the blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there was no gilding in the place.
There are signs of one organized criminal group of another at the village house, as well as several pull holes in the doors.
11 Captures in the Cadreite
The Ministry of National Security introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group, which was mainly in the municipality of Kadereit, and who were accused of kidnapping, murder, "female" and secret funerals.
According to the published information, on 11 November, eight persons were detained in the Los Alvero colony, and one person in the hostages was saved.
They were provided with three homes and a telephone, requiring them to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., military personnel took a patrol trip to the village of Old Rancho in Kadereita, when he saw the car with two men in the living room without a number of signs.
When they were stopped and inspected, the soldiers found a rifle, a cartridge, and 18 cartridges.
Later, on 13 November at 14:00 a.m., one of their associates was stopped on the public land of La Prad, which, having seen the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret funerals in the municipalities of Henral Teran, Hen and Kadereit.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new Government that will face the crisis that put that country on the brink of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new Government that faces the crisis that has put Italy at the brink of the economic disaster and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Court stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President George Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet composed mainly of technocratics, although it is not possible when the new executive body will take its position.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in our country's ability to leave this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to the reporters.
Monty did not directly say that he had been able to form a government, but a tone of his comments showed that obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well defined," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a Government less than three days, which was much less common, because Italy had fought the political and financial crisis that had raised their debt to a critical level.
The administration, under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty, should approve the package of a severe economy required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to speed up, unstable markets have established income from Italy's BTP bonds of 10 years more than 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegalia, the leader of the Italian Employers' Federation, told reporters after a meeting with Monty: "We said we would actively support this Government."
We believe that it is the Government's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of Silvio Berlusconi's LDP party, which was forced to retire on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts must lead to a good outcome," said the reporters Angelino Alfano, the Secretary of the Party of Centralist Rights.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the majority of the government, consisting of the technocrats formed by Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular with severe economic reforms.
Any blocking or stopping of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has intensified the pressure, warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups on Monday, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He's gonna finish the chain of his meetings Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlin would retire, Italy's debt value has now reached a critical level in the face of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Italy's public debt savings of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern eurozone financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would be in existence before the next elections, which were scheduled for 2013, despite widespread forecasts, that policies would only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said he wanted to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that he should be made up only of technical experts, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation.
Political sources reported that the mutual mistrust and disagreement of parties made it difficult to include political figures.
Spanish Games More Than Ticos
Of the 22 players claimed in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
By Costa Rica, only one of the 22 alleged players played 50 matches.
A minor contrast with Costa Rica, compared to 22 players from both countries to a match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and Europe champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a full list of class A games, Tricolor has only the defender Michael Humana as the only one who has held 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish football players playing all the stars in the League and in the strong British Premier League clubs were very active during this year in the League and in the local Cup matches, and they were high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
To this end, the experience of the Spanish Fury should be added in a complex qualification in the Euro or the World Championship.
The Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in the area of CONCAFF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is taking the lead in the list in the Spanish collection of golfer Iker Kasilis, who last Sunday against England (a 0-1 match in London) repeated the record of ex-golper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casilis is playing against Tricolor today and will establish a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
In Hawaii's Ernandes, Barcelona's player, 106 matches.
Casilias and Hawaii were recognized as the best Wefas last week, together with the other player of the Iberian team, Subisarret, with 126 matches and a Raul Gonzalez bomber, with 102.
Almost close to a hundred Charles Puyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres - from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos - from 81, Andres Inesta - from 62, Sesk Fabregas - from 61 and David Silva - from 53.
On the side of Costa Rica near Michael Humana, the left side of Hunior Dias with 48 matches and Bryan Ruis bomber, from 45.
Further, only five crossed the border in 30 games: Kaylor Navas from 31, Randall Asfeifa from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Ernandes from 36 and José Luis Lopes from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain in Gerar Pike (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santa Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
With less than 30 exits on the field there are Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Muri with 23.
The rest didn't even reach 20.
When Nacho Moreal had only four games, and Hordi Alba had two games, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolivar had only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder had not yet won.
The leading Spanish game, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres, from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruis has become the one who brought more points twice as much as Carlos Ernandes and three times as Roy Muri and Parks.
Quintet has put the country on tour for 20 years of career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream to come
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Amant from Pearl Jam, the group was ready to give one of the best concerts on the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It was more than 20 years of expectation, but the group said it was also their dream of being a reality to play in that country.
This was a statement by the bassist and founder, Jeff Amenta, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the territory of South America in the course of the tour for the twenty-year period of work and on Sunday, 20 numbers, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will be at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with a team from Los Angeles The X and the local group of Las Robertas.
It's a segment from an interview with full decryption available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans, it's a dream that Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream to us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's all going well.
I was only in Costa Rica once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That is why we are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension days before the concert.
What will you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we're sorry that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, are like the biggest show of a year.
Does that add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in San Paulo, and we hope this has led us to this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we like to do serfing and jungles with regard to these two things, Costa Rica, one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We have a lot of serif friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are amazing.
My friends always go to Serfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are great places for Serfing, as we know, from people who love Serfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you did a great show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We're trying to make the best show of the most varied songs possible; we're trying to play several songs from each album and present to our fans a wide variety of repertoires.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How does it work?
I think that's partly because we have nine tiles and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and why we could forget.
That makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
That's what you've been doing for 20 years.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we're in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years is making it like a dream.
We are happy with our successes and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we've always wanted to go.
It's all very good for us.
What does it mean to be a large part of the border?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's healthy when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from one city appears but much more strange when five or ten groups appear in one city at a time.
We are proud and honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw the Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with them all and to us we were honored to be part of the sound of Seattle that was received.
It is also very strange that your type group remains together for such a long time.
Yes, four of us were 21 together, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups.
First of all, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second of all, we'll take care of others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, we have also opened up the musical pathways that give everyone the freedom of the experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything could not be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy; but thanks to your success, you were able to do everything you wanted.
How are you in balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We'll take care not to be too long on the tour because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what it did, not to be famous or to be a rock star, which none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at first it was wonderful.
We have been a group for almost three years and have not released any albums until the end of the year.
It was a lot of disappointment because it took so long, and most importantly, that we still have close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or I see a photograph, I think of the amazing person who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and many others.
He was a great man, and we miss him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open up?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video suggestions, and it was a group that we liked most, so we don't have to wait to see what Las Robertas could offer, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing the words at Yellow Ledbetter at the concerts?
That's Eddy Wedder's question, so I don't know.
He's gonna put it in his head, and I think he's gonna use the first thing he's got in his head.
Who influenced you like a bassist?
So many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Gizer Butler, John Entvisll, Si J Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
They're so many that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the border's relevance, despite the fact that he's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling a bit of brittleness.
When I think of him, he reminds me of groups that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great because it's the music that's worth listening to, and Mudhoney's teams are now creating music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it is more positive.
How would you explain this change?
That's interesting, because, I think there are a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, even though they may sound a little positive.
From both of them when Ed played them, I cried when I heard them, those songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up, and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or another, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was again hospitalized for medical examination
The former president, Alberto Fuhimori, was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital, his family doctor informed him that he had lost his muscle strength.
Fuhimori, 72 years old, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has led him to surgery four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Agigna, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fuhimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Non-Plastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of force in its lower limbs.
Agigna said that he believed that Fuhimori should be the candidate for the benefit of forgiveness from humanitarian considerations; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew that he was innocent.
He carried four operations into a language cancer, lost 18 pounds in weight, added other diseases, such as strong erosive gastritis, iron oxides, hip stones, high blood pressure and blood pressure problems in the legs, listed the doctor.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Administration of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the forces of destruction of the army, which acted in secret in the first years of his reign.
Muhika is being sent to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, headed by President José Muhika and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will visit Mexico on Tuesday to increase trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Muhika will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important item in the comprehensive plan of meetings with the political, commercial and community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, as announced by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of two presidents in Guadalahara would be “beneficial for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking to support Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nikola Sarkozi included the South American country in a tax letter at the G20 meeting in the French city of Kane.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to remove those countries remaining tax havens from the international community, which called for a protest in Uruguay and responded to the consultation of his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group established from the most developed and developing countries, and in fact, with the South American country since January this year, an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to accelerate the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements to leave this “serious list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development made up of countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been in force since 2004 in Mexico and Uruguay, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The built-in plumber will become three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario fought continuously for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil lap of the Bowzer, but never before did he do so in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopy technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops all over the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS port console, which allows to play in three dimensions without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell us how to work stereoscopy without glasses," said Nintendo's head of press in Spain, Omar Alvares, during the presentation of the Madrid game.
Alvares said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially designed under this platform", because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adapted to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence of 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and moving game.
Alvares said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
On one occasion, most experts will go "on the second round" to the levels of games that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or those who only affect the depth of action, but who need to play in three dimensions in order to overcome various obstacles and “do not give in to optical illusions”.
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also means the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo drives a series of fans and repeats a successful formula from the previous games, the watertight guide with all of them has to go through dangerous landing platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the game will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "playing" of Luigi.
The Colombo guarantees the extradition of the Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Cole said Tuesday that Alfonso Portillo's extradition process had begun to respond in the United States to a 70 million-dollar lease.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which required the extradition of Portillo to judge it there.
At the Colum press conference, his decision was related to the independence of the judicial and executive authorities, given that the Court of First Instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he had not “applied his hands” to legal decisions and had adopted all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marrokin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injuries, as well as Edgar Estrad Morales and Victor Estrad Parades, both for drug trafficking.
What Coloma did was shown by the executive process after all legal and constitutional courts had been exhausted in order to prosecute the ex-head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CJC), the Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on its legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of its human rights.
The portal was found to be innocent of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was the process of previous extraditions, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who have been subjected to social isolation have helped to overcome difficult situations during this fourth century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the ceremony at the premises of the former Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared in the light near the Trinity of Well in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or marginalization.
Yesterday's Sant Andreu celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and agencies that had been working with the association for the past 25 years.
The various political representations during the elections have shown the unity of work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generality, Arthur Massa, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhola, attended the ceremony, former Socialist Education Adviser Ernest Maragal, and former mayor and current Ecosocialist, a member of the City Council, Richard Goma.
Also appeared in Fabra I Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Consultant, José Luis Claris and the Social Work of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work that has been done so far "is a good base".
The President introduced Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad conditions and the realization of hope in people with difficulty.
"The crisis is not new for the organization and work done by it," he said.
Captured building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
Catchers occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare of the neighbors living in the house 51 on Balmes Street was over.
Yesterday, 12 people volunteered to leave the building, which they illegally occupied, and where they organized mass parties that harassed neighbors, as the court ruled, without interference from the police.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on there will be a checkout," said the manager.
The Quateress, who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the others settled, assigned all electricity and some water, cut down the walls and left behind the traces of a variety of types, especially alcoholic banks.
The first three floors were a place for mass dinners that lasted up to two days and upset the owners.
The building is right behind the night club, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, its income had fallen by 80 per cent.
The club's owner says that the building's occupants got her into an unfair competition, because they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the discotheque owner had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors to the noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the club's visitors but by the people of the neighborhood and, above all, by those who attended the parties that had organized, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The club's owner said that the disadvantages were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and that's for nine months now how he "forgives" her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that more complaints had been received in recent weeks from neighbours.
The president of the PP municipal group, Alberto Fernand Dias, requested that the building be evacuated immediately last week to address the problems of coexistence and the general spirit of the neighbours and degradation in this area.
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building had been busy before summer, but in the last few months the Quatters had invaded all the floors and almost every room and that some of them had broken.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to end impunity and to stand firm against the unculturalism that is being created in the building.”
So yesterday, police officers evacuated a building in New Barrice.
At 15:30, the police left on Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a contest after contribution recommendations
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Kolserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the current siege of the City Corporation of Barcelona (SCB), this administration had printed a press release for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of the Barcelona capital.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison of the pictures with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park again took part in many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few, not north-south, but up (top) down (the sea).
The position of Kolserol as a natural park is contrary to that idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cab in the role of Yogi bear.
This was so until, in September, the Council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for numerous other doors in Coliseum.
There's no doubt about the idea of a park under the door.
Either way, or someone wants to put a door on the field.
The question is one: Kolserola, park or mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repetitive topic discussed when two members of this tribe of elected people know each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roland, after reaching the coast line, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “front of the mountain” when the offer by Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, has not been made.
"It must be admitted that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Besides, thanks to its excellent availability.
Kolserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Colserola Gate" contains a "word hunt": we should not think of them as "the entrance to the park, but as the limitation of some areas where we should operate".
The model, like Roland and Bayona, with experience in urban construction, called the "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
The risks arising from the “uncertainty of public space forecasting” after the experience of the 80s, which ended at the Forum’s “Singing Song”.
First of all, it's a limit where you can build.
"Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step", there is a transition.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [as regards the General Capital Plan (GSP)] may lead to real distress."
Close to the case, Modola believes that the Colserol valley can be understood as a park, Barcelona, and not as a purely topographic issue.
The model recalls that there is already work done outside Calserola, which is “not to be missed by the ear”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that Mary offers his profession to enter the project “from the beginning”.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows architects to enter the debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is that it should be led by interdisciplinary teams (“success”, he argues), which should have been created: “Architators should only be an instrument”.
Baiona argues that the answer to the question that calls for this part is complex, since the rules of the competition do not cover the general nature of Kolserola: “There have been 16 cross-competitions,” he says, “but there is no lengthy reading here to see and understand the area as a whole”.
This requires, at least in his case, the participation of 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one door can be crossed by the program and defined by the project architect for the next door.
In your view, the Council must ensure that the area is directly above Ronda de Dalt to provide a full area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrastabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the judge, the representative of Red Casino, forgave Brother Monterey in the proceedings against him on indictment.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legitimate representative of Red Casino has given him forgiveness before the Second District Court, which conducts proceedings against Mary Monterrey's brother.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos, where apparently Manuel Jonas required him to pay an economic contribution so that the Monterey authorities could allow a secret operation in a private home.
After a public conviction, the Public Prosecutor General opened a criminal case against Brother Mayor and was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison on 2 September.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Offences, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old part of the capital of the State.
He remained in that place for 49 days, following the requirements of the second order for the prohibition of displacement after the prosecutor had eliminated the crime of kidnapping and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadereito for claiming half a million peso to the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison, with the average degree of isolation of prisoners, because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue in the municipal prison in San Nicolas, Garze.
On 25 October, the arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that, after almost two months of investigations, Jonah ' s guilt evidence, such as the admission of 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers for the purpose of the transaction, was clearly sufficient.
On Monday, the legitimate representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garsia Gomes, came before Judge José Luis Pesin to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the next few hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether he had compensated for the damage and which of the partners in the firehouse was apologizing, although the lawyer was trying not to make a name.
Based on the records of 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrastabal, and no statements could subsequently be made concerning the process that was planned against him; nor would any compensation be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookstores, at almost 15:50, it was proposed to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The court official, Jorge Janes, went to San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Peres Hakome tells about the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (IST) reported that the results of an accident in which the Minister of Internal Affairs Francisco Blake Mora and seven others were killed showed that the helicopter was hit directly on the ground in full integrity without an attempt by the pilot to make an emergency landing.
During the press conference Dionysio Peres Hakome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the airship was lifted up, the pilot discovered that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The elements that seem to show that the ship had several contact from the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters where the means lost the flux."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, to meet the required requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that the research carried out in the impact area did not indicate the existence of parts on the ground.
"The study reported that there were no components of the ship elsewhere, and the impact was structurally complete.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant passenger transport requirements.
The land in this place has a deviation from seven to 30 degrees.
To date, the Secretary said, chiefly, to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopes Meyer, Director General of Airports and Subsidiary Services, said that during the attack, a presidential helicopter was controlled at a cruiser speed and that it happened on a soft, rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal summer manoeuvre at the time of the impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Hakome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation rules, the flight was conducted under the visual flight rules, which means that the crew should have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified the appropriate conditions for flight when the aircraft was sent to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where low altitude clouds were observed.
Selected routes:
It may have been because of the cloud conditions of the team that sought the lower altitude and greater visibility of the Kuernawak valley.
The place hits.
The impact coordinates and the latest aircraft radar records are likely to coincide with no loss of control or change in flight direction prior to the impact.
Rolling blocks in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and the side line.
The dispersal of the cracks suggests that the helicopter was faced with the ground under structural integrity.
No apparent signs of fire or explosion were found:
There is still no evidence in the area of the disaster in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that multiple land contact could occur.
During field work, aircraft pieces were found at 9,200 feet above sea level, and the land has a distance from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The picture shows the sequence in which it was destroyed on its way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions from the ground.
After a thorough study in more territory than in the area near the site of the disaster, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces a gene search program for obesity
Social protection leads to a study on the search for obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) announced that a study was being conducted to detect obesity in children and young people, who had been given the title “Genetics of breast-feeding in children and adolescents” protocol, which would provide an overview of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, the Head of the Medical Research Unit for Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the twenty-first century, Miguel Crus Lopes explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been gathered.
This team is assisted by specialists and graduates of the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Institute of Political Technology (NPI).
The study invites the population (written or not) to participate by sending the MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday, from 8:00 a.m. to the day of the children ' s participation.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to lead to a sports centre in Kuwaito (west of Mexico) and that since 8 October, activities had taken place at a sports centre in Nesaualkoottle (east of Mexico).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is achieved, the study will continue in the Centre for Independence (South Mexico) and finally in the Centre for Sport Morelos (North Mexico).
He explained that the aim of this study was to understand the genetics and the importance of obesity development and to establish a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, the World Day against Diabetes will be observed, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents between 6 and 14 years of age with parents ' permission and under their supervision to complete individual food surveys.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or initial insufficiency.
He explained that anthropometric measurements of all participants (weights, growth and size of the waist), blood pressure and glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes related to child obesity) would be conducted on Saturday.
Crus Lopes said that this study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase of 77 per cent in the case of boys, 47 per cent in the case of girls, and a significant increase has also been observed in the case of girls," said MSSI expert.
He said that the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the country ' s population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He claimed that the average Mexican was 65 per cent of the American Indians ' descendants, 30 per cent of the Europeans ' descendants and five per cent of the Africans ' descendants, and that this condition affected the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that mainly because of obesity genetics, the body is unable to burn the excess of energy that we consume (calorie) and it is depleted in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that a comprehensive assessment of children was a direct benefit to participants, which could determine whether they had at least any excess weight or obesity.
In fact, he said that the presence of dark deposits on the neck (acants) and foreheads meant that metabolism and even prediabetes were likely to occur.
The information is addressed with full confidentiality, and the doctor will hand it over in writing to the parents, whom they explain all the measurements and changes in the form of life that must be taken to avoid disease.
Crus Lopes explained that there were three main causes of excessive weight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a life-style or a lack of daily physical activity, a greater part of the day in front of the TV, and the use of transport on short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high level of fat and protein content and genetic presupposition as analysed in the programme.
UNAM asphalt will be able to avoid friction
Rafael Errera, a chemical researcher at UNAM, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality that is environmentally friendly and temperature-resistant.
If the signals sent by road cover were to be given attention, about 200 thousand eggs would have to be repaired for each rainy season in the valley of Mexico City, said Rafael Errera Naher, a chemical researcher at UNAM, and added that if the construction and maintenance of an asphalt road cover is correct, the quantity of them could be reduced or even reduced to zero.
His lecture The Technical View of the Jama read in the International Year of Chemistry reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible was developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with characteristics close to the bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore to counter their education.
He explained that bitumen, the hardest part of oil is the sequence of carbon molecules, some high molecular mass called asphalts, and others low molecular mass called maltens, which together add to the road cover its characteristic binding behavior.
The interfering behavior of the bitumen is that at high temperatures about 180 degrees it conducts itself as a liquid, at 120 degrees high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it maintains almost firm condition, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that resistance to street asphalt is not permanent but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, the specialist in chemical engineering said.
The scholar Hymphak noted that the streets of Mexico are mainly covered by flexible coverings made up of six layers of material, three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small stones dropped in bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that forms this cover, he said it was loaded in bitumen.
When moving vehicles and applying efforts, it helps the forces to make a very good distribution on the road surface.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the surface of the asphalt, he added, the last layer, which is called the layer of export made of a small stone, actually also the sand loaded into the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the transport wheels, it must have more resistance than asphalt cover and provide road train.
As part of the road cover, which will receive and distribute these efforts, the volume of exports also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is produced needs to be taken into account.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on the state of the asphalt.
When the earth is raw, water penetrates into the surface and it is difficult to get out of it, it causes all layers of cover to be spread and therefore food education.
When educating, he said that the first layer of exports had been removed and only then affected the bitumen, but the damage had not occurred instantly, which should be given attention to the first signs of the current repair programmes.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that transport load was another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of cover should always be linked to transport load and it was necessary to ensure that this requirement was met to prevent frequent occurrence of them.
Rafael Errera said that much still needs to be studied and done about the bitumen, for example, by bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help to make holes with ease and without high temperatures.
What's wrong with Vale's candidate to become a new Miss Columbia?
An analysis of the causes that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
Representative Vale received the Princess's title 14 times.
The next time Vale del Cauca was just wanting to find Miss Colombia's crown.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be satisfied with the fact that she had come to the stage of the winners with a silver crown and a band proclaiming her new princess Colombia.
In view of the outcome reached last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica won the crown and the shield, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins in the legion of the women from Vale del Cauca who were close to the crown, but were announced by the princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Bellina Ayala (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuel Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Heise Alhure Gars (2000), Catheli Gars (2000), Catheli Gars.
The question that many are now asking:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the speeches showed that she had everything to become a new Miss Colombia, not just that she was elected by the Royal Police and the most beautiful person in the Vogue version, the titles that the Queens had, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to condemn her to the title of the First Princess was that she was unable to answer confidently the question, "What book characterizes you and why?
She replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I certainly think that a book that characterizes my childhood -- "The Little Prince" -- is a pretty deep book.
Today, I read "The Crime and Punishment," the head of the world literature that we all should read; I also read the book of Irina Nemirovska, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Blood. "
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term “ocultation” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books describes it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said she was calm and happy with her result: "The whole world is wise, what must happen."
And all of you, please read a little bit of the "Small Prince" is a great book.
Among the sounds of hypotheses – Vale burned out of favoritism.
The Bogotá reporter suggested that, because she was preferred, met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the Austrian culinary contest, the visual vote for the best national costume, and the Queen-Matt), "that provoked the zeal of other candidates, caused stress to the queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage".
And this was noted during her first appearance in the bathroom on Hilton Beach and during her two performances on evening coronation.
Although she looked certain, it was noticed that she lacked the strength and energy that the Magdalena and the Atlantic represented.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that a candidate who wins more prizes during the contest does not become a queen"
In addition, representative Valé recently avoided communication with the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vale failed to try to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the Krasota National Competition.
That is why two days before the election of a member of the international jury Lucy Doti said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at the outside, but also focus on public awareness before they participate in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
Also, there is the assumption that representative Vale was wrong with the defects in the beef and fibre that was seen in her life, but it is controversial, since the jury noted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The King's Advisor, Jorge Ernan Orosko, notes that Melina had no better body, which was and was better, "but the problems of the fibrosis on life, which were not very noticeable to me, caused her to lose her eyes on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Crocos believes that the error of representative Vale de Cauca was that she was undergoing surgery.
"Operations are good, but representative Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize, which was first given by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the cruel prediction was made last night, saying that it was the uncle that Raymond gave Melin as compensation for her lack of pleasure in obtaining the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact that Melina today has a year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia at an international competition, as stated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will come to history as one of the kings who, despite his excellent speech at the Cartagena competition, faced challenges in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of a man who knew the body of Alfonso Cano.
A criminal from Kali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these servants is key.
On November 4, CTI Kali was in history as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC Alfonso Cano in comparison to his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminalists working at the CTI this week, Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tehada who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation, took the lead.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to spend more than five days in jungles to reach places where bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Vale, and after finishing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in criminalism, where he studied leather training, i.e., ladons and mice.
During the week of Elizar's operation on human identity, known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear no more than three days.
Something big was coming up.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Cauca in Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest partisan war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the fingerprints of Gilermo Leon Saens (his current name).
However, when he came from a research group to the location where the body was located, he did not recognize it externally; he was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without beards, dressed as a local farmer, without corners, and much worse.
But prints aren't worth it.
Using a magnifying glass, a blacksmith, a shovel, and a fireman, Elizar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the picture.
His eyes didn't look like it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehada asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the RVSC
Find Fingerprints
The recognition received by President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González of President Sijin of Kali at the press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Dachtyloscopy is a strict science, without mistake, that it can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, dentists participate in investigation of crimes, such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of detainees.
In detention, many criminals have false certificates or no documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of theft, he had to bring a piece of the wall to his house, because in this place, he was armed with a hand to hold a safe, full of values and money.
"It's hard to work with walls because they're not comfortable surfaces to remove prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire barn and establish the identity of the criminal who took part in several cheats," he says.
The prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in cases of murder.
A dead man had recently been found with bottles under a picture around him.
The investigation found that a family member could be suspected of committing a crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle actually coincided.
Although it does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A specialist in dactyloscope from CTI explained that there is a chemical or physical reagent in places where there are prints.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or entered in the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that this was not the case, as shown in the CSI telegram.
Just like all the gold that shines, not all that you touch, leaves a mark on you.
However, if possible, a comparison will be made.
"Disgraced People" pose a challenge to the New York authorities
Hundreds of protestors broke up in front of Zukotti Square.
Some of the protestors heard the court's decision to disarm the demonstration from the scene and went to the neighborhood park.
The members of the Wall Street Zahvati movement called on the authorities of New York on Tuesday, when they tried to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, the Manhattan area from which they were evacuated to the sky while trying to capture another Greater Apple Park.
Hundreds of protestors dug in Zukotti Square, where they wanted to fall through a court order that allowed "enraged people" to break camp in the square while the other part of the movement responded to the raid by catching the park in the north of the city where further arrests were held
"Our idea is that once the court does not allow us to break up the camp in the square, we will break down the camp somewhere else and continue to fight for the return to Zukotti and for peaceful sit-downs and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the Wall Street movement, Mark Brey.
Bray explained that the response of the "distorted people" to the evacuation of the palace city, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had been brought to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing the protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "disgraced people" began to capture a new park located on the site of the merger of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the tunnel of Holland, which joins New York and New Jersey, and which is owned by the Trinity Church.
At least they could take the place, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the protestors, although Bree could not name the exact number, but told Efe that she had seen several journalists who were also in the handcuffs.
The Organization assures that several hundred people stood in tents where the delegation of religious leaders had gone to demonstrate support for members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti's area, which is private owned, remains closed pending the trial scheduled for Tuesday, which will examine the legality of this morning's protest.
Some of the protesters who were sent there carried and distributed copies of that order at the same time and even gave those copies to the police guarding the area, which led to "some small clashes", said Brey, who said that some police were demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuated members of the Wall Street Watch movement and from forcing them to enforce “laws issued after the arrest or to prohibit demonstrators from re-entering the park with shops and other property used previously”.
Mary Bloomberg told reporters that the city ' s court order had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed of it, but local laws did not allow them to relaunch tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council has personally justified the removal of protestors from Zukotti Square, an operation in which some 200 arrests were committed, and the decision was made because the protesters “infringement of the law”.
Blomberg said he gave orders to clean up the area because it became "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others", because "some businesses were threatened" and neighbors were afraid of "decreasing the quality of life".
The evacuation, which took place this morning, was repugnant and showed that in the depth of Bloomberg's soul more interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added the representative of the movement, who condemned the mayor for “non-respect of freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for the Wall Street Trust also indicated that they were planning to organize “grantial actions” on Thursday in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions to remember the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will become Devo Maria in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bubble and other Canadians, she will appear on the television program "Rassell Peters's Birth" on 1 December.
Canada's Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen at the Big Repair, a rescuer at Malibu Rescues, Banni at Playboy, a woman rock musician Tommy Li, and now the actress and model will become Devo Maria at a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with a crowner (executor) Michael Bubble and other Canadians, will appear on the Rassel Peters television program on 1 December, in the role of Mary in particular.
CTV presented a television show today, in which Anderson, also known as the Internet’s wide-spread home porn video, is still a husband, the drummer of the Mötley Crüe group, Tommy Li, who is dressed as Deva Maria, who is holding a doll with Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently appeared as the leader of the Tour "My Cruel Torch of Truth" Charlie Shin, appears to be Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peter, CTV is a Canadian singer, Bobble, who was married in Buenos Aires at the Argentine model Louisiana Lopillato, and who also knows a lot about scandals.
Bubble recently called American Kim Cardassian a "sooky" at one of his concerts in New York
Japan, born after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still facing a devastating earthquake that has led to the nuclear crisis, the most terrible catastrophe that the rising sun has been forced to face since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo Government, material losses amounted to $300,000 — a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to be going on.
After three loss quarters, data on the gross domestic product from July to September have certainly helped to reverse the page: GDP rose by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
Registered in the second quarter, the Japanese financial year begins in March 2012 and also sets the fastest growth rates from January to March 2010.
Rebirth may be partly due to the repurchasing of machinery for the recovery of areas devastated by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent against a decrease of 0.9 per cent of the capital costs observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real transition to the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan impulse, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen or restructure infrastructures, using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly because of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This figure increased by 1% as a result of an increase in car, travel and rest costs.
Clyde Xine
Tokyo has provided the internal market, when Yena, the Japanese currency, became one of the refugee currencies selected by investors who want to escape the debt crisis in the euro area and negative US forecasts, a privilege that, as a stone, has been given to exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, production is expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to the country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonny, for example, blame the yene in their low rates from July to September.
While markets continue to sit in the EU's peripheral countries, the Esihiko Noda Government is not losing its vigilance.
We must be careful about the remaining risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp increase in the value of the yen, Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa said yesterday.
In fact, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts the world economy's breakthroughs, has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell to four tenths to 100.4 points compared with 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it dropped to eight tenths to 99.13 points.
The Affins Reproduce Doubts
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the preservatives would not sign any written obligation
With the peripheral risk and uncertainty premium in the parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “agreement” of the new transitional government of Ellad is being applied to Brussels rather than to the true conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed upon when he was appointed might be insufficient for their application, the Conservative Party leader of the New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new measures of a strict economy in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections on 19 February.
The main objective of the Government was to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates, which were given tomorrow's voice of confidence in the new executive authority.
The package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first introduction.
However, Samaras's message does not express any doubt about his position: "We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing."
The leader of the Conservatives did more than one step in his attitude towards the EU and IMF, organizations that were to freeze 8,000 million people who urgently needed Athens, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
However, the European Commission, still trying to dissipate the effect of the Papandreou referendum's claims in a whole or nothing, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unanimous: it will not renew aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main parties of Greece do not sign "a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Amadeu Altafay said that triangular inspectors could return to Athens soon to discuss with the new Government what should be done to pay for the sixth tranche, of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been indicated.
In the Greek club, the nets will be enough for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "core" place for this type of finance
Spain “was a prominent place in the world in microfinance”.
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second-largest donor of cooperation instruments, whose “resistance” she said, is that it is “a tool for social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity based on faith in humans”.
Yesterday, the Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valyadolid with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “very necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and “in particular with the aim of reducing the double number of people living less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is set”.
Spain "is still working" to expand the network of beneficiaries worldwide and to take on this task with full "responsibility", says Ms. Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "provide new and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, "the basic recipients of these loans".
There are "a lot of achievements" and "a lot of the difficulties we face."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that promotes "two main objectives".
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and hundreds of millions of households would be selected from the poverty in which they were loaded.
The impetus for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world “walked on the road that began years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Ms. Sofia as “act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as a "favorable idealist in the general fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy on site.
This experience was transferred to the first World Summit in Washington a year later, and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen continuous development everywhere”, said Her Majesty, whose relationship with the project brought her the title “the head of the family”, which was collected in Valyadolid’s “poor banker”.
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded her statement by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and finding solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Foreign Minister Trinidad Hymenez said solidarity was an "ethical imperative" for each democratic State.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the economic boom times, since this was a “permanent commitment”.
Hymenes concluded that microcredit entails a “serious and solid course to eradicate poverty”, and now “greater than ever” the Governments of developed countries must work on the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be a victim of a reduction in expenditure.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Sarajevo Rodriguez, praised the “successful” to give “reliance” to those “closed to whom all doors are closed” and Mayor Valyadolid Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all present in the city who “opens its doors, covered by the spirit of solidarity”.
HDS proposes to elect the President of the Eurocommission by a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (HDS) in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, passed without any major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but only in the autumn, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that government policies are far from strict as they should be today with Greece and perhaps with Italy tomorrow....
The draft resolution on the Presidency in the European Commission, which was discussed by the management, was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from the vote.
The ovations continued for a few minutes, which earned their statements by Angela Merkel and several hours later Wolfgang Shoible, the eurofil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is “not less Europe, but more Europe”.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, the time has come for a break in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, which make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control of the financial policies of the Eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote, "to give Europe a person".
In any case, it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Shoible.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly with this decision; Britain is against it, and HDS leaders believe that Nikola Sarkozi is against it too.
But the ground is ready.
Likewise, delegates by the overwhelming majority refused to weigh the voice of each member of the Euro-Union in the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
The chancellor has increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kolya, but it has not tried to influence the congress through "small" European countries or countries in difficult situations that like to criticise "high-cost" Germany.
Although the whole paragraph of the draft resolution on Europe refers to the importance of the German-French friendship, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
It's just an emergency.
Remember that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What's a fake with the hospital sheets?
As a result of the cash benefits, the UMP and the Government began to appear on hospital records.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordo to visit the Family Benefit Distribution Fund and address the issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on combating social benefits fraud.
In order to help this phenomenon, which arose from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but which was also a part of the presidential re-election campaign, the majority wanted to focus on hospital records.
First of all, with regard to the budget economy, the Government intends to impose on private company employees the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the employer's special consent, the sick worker loses pay for four days, which is at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to produce a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose one day without the payment of the sickness benefit (the public servants have not yet had to wait for the payment of the benefit, unlike the three-day expectation for private sector workers).
Now that these issues are discussed, most of them also raise the subject of fraud again, with regard to ill-use in the issuance of hospital letters.
Control will become more demanding and additional, if you get caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you received," Xavie Bertran warned at the RTL channel on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital records.
They have indeed been under constant control and political attacks since 2002.
People in France suffer no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the numbers on the side.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million Euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros, 5 per cent of total health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were for statutory leave and accidents in production and 54 per cent for sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 thousand euros.
As a result, 2.5 per cent of health-related expenditures were incurred.
The French conducted an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic that conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management site showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken one day of the hospital.
Another study on health insurance claims that 37 per cent of patients had less than 8 days in 2010, 15 per cent of 15 days in one month, 15 per cent of one to three months in another, and 11 per cent had been longer.
If you compare these figures to the figures of European neighbours, it is clear that French workers are not more likely to be hospitalized than those of any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by the two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence of work in France (for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with the hospital leaves is very low compared to "serious" employment.
With regard to the level of fraud, it's very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has resulted in a systematic check of hospital duration for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases examined by CNAM, 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term findings were “unjustified” or too long”, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematic hospital records over 45 days, 11 per cent of 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", which was 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases were "unfounded" by several million workers receiving hospital letters.
Figures that show very few cases compared, for example, to the "serious" number of jobs.
According to UMP Dominika Tiana, the author of the report on this issue in June, they account for between 9 and 15,000 million euros of unscrupulous budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Padatimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos said in Parliament, adding that 100 days allocated to his coalition Government were insufficient to carry out this task.
"To achieve the objective of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on the voice of confidence in Parliament on the environment.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the “core task” of the new Government, since the country ' s presence in the Eurozone is “imposed” - he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a reduction in the country ' s budget deficit of approximately 9 per cent from GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right to refuse the measures of the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further measures of a strict economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with Members of his Party of New Democracy.
He agreed with the challenges of reducing the deficit and debt and combating corruption, but also his denial of any course that impeded the recovery of the economy.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economics and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU did not block the required credit of 8 billion euros without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legitimize euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance, as stated by the Committee of Experts
Canadians refuse to die, approved in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, the health institutions and the doctor work together to ensure the best palliative care, without regard to cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code in such a way as to permit suicide with foreign aid and euthanasia when the choice is subject to circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to take such a decision.
To begin with, the experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10 locations, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death”.
Because of medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report came to the conclusion that the Federal Government was opposed to the position that they had already stated that they wanted nothing to change in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization has an impact on the use of violence, that is to say, euthanasia or suicide with foreign assistance against people who cannot or do not wish to make such a decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed during the Jocelin Downi teleconference, which presented the report, most of which were in countries where euthanasia and suicide were not legalized with foreign aid.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelin Downi.
Candace for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians advocate euthanasia, because, according to Angus Reid's 2010 survey, they believe that this will help people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 per cent believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not be a sign that the life of older persons or persons with disabilities is less valuable.
With regard to people who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for the rejection of medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal persecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative assistance, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal session already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to alleviate physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related legislation experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the Royal Society of Canada ' s experts.
Metr Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described as the "end of" the position of experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it does not restrict the use of euthanasia in mortal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of living and who is over 18 years of age can ask for help in committing suicide, says Metro Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Meter Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to be independent of the person above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Sommerville also expresses “a categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called “the manifesto for euthanasia”.
Margaret Sommerville, himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid are legalized as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to give up power
Damascus condemns "presentation"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The participants of Bashar Assad demonstrated yesterday before the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar Asada, who, with the support of Russia, opposed him and condemned the “concept” against his country.
Two days later, following the suspension of Syrian membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, and the Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan resigned from President Assad.
The King of Jordan Abdullah II was the first Arab leader yesterday, who summoned President Bashar Assad to take power in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the armed forces were killed.
"If Bashar had been in the interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighbour of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, were not successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot meet their wishes lose power, he said, in favour of Syria, the neighbouring country in which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the extension of consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and such countries as Turkey, are taking an ever-increasing course towards repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department, noted.
At that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 military personnel died in the region of Derwa in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents died during the shooting and shooting of heavy bullets in Jobara in the occupied town of Homs, according to the NGO.
During the press conference, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Syria, Valid Muallem, said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the League of Arab States to delete Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, believing that this will fail."
Following its decision to remove Syria from the League of Arab States, it is currently examining “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the recruitment of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers.
The French Foreign Minister, Alan Juppe, also spoke of the dispatch of observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said fell into “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League was scheduled for tomorrow in Rabata to discuss the implementation of the exit plan, adopted on 2 November, which included, inter alia, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where the fighting is taking place and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called yesterday a "incorrect" decision by the League of Arab States, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty requires time for Italian markets and victims
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form their own team and to implement a programme that would require "victims" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of the Berlin government.
The former European Commissioner yesterday participated in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate office made up of non-parliamentary technocrats.
Monty spoke about the importance of a programme involving many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups that took part in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for the Prime Minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Janfranko Finini said that he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote in confidence by Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting would end with a presentation by Mr. Monty of a limited list of dozens or around those ministers, the head of the country, Georgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bond holders, requesting time.
In “democracy takes time to prepare the Government and the programme, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding”.
His appointment by the President was initially approved by the markets, but concern arose again, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team, which included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include "politics".
The new Government will have to act by 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranko Fini, the new Government will be given the confidence of Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that, once he entered the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important active person in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Rehn stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the budget for 2013, in spite of the severe economic plan adopted in recent months, has required, in particular, new stringent measures.
The Italian boss Emma Marchegalia, who met with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because the country that is not growing cannot meet the deficits.”
Mr. Monty, well-known for his competence and independence in the home of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented a “change of era” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing “serious challenges” and “other Italy”, according to the authors.
The longevity of his team is unknown.
The President of Naples would be pleased to avoid early elections, as by April 2012, Italy should pay public debt payments of 200 thousand euros.
Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scholar Wiacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed on Monday the US nuclear-hazardous agency.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, which was largely based on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "beginning in the sixties, at the Soviet nuclear centre in Chelabinska (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosive methods".
In 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to set up a company producing nanoalmases in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 until his return to Russia
In its report, IAEA mentions “the obvious signs that Iran’s nuclear detonator system has “proved the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well but also informed the Agency that he had worked most of his career in this technology under his country’s military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday 2009-2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence during the same period were slightly reduced or not changed.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equal to 49 per cent, compared to an increase of 13 per cent in Catholic violence, a decrease of 4 per cent in Jewish attacks and a total increase of 14 per cent in religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes reported by the FBI has increased very little to 6,628 cases, 47.3 per cent of which were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After the 2009 decline, there is concern that the number of these crimes is growing again, emphasizes the human rights organization Human Rights First, “the increase in violence against Muslims,” adds the organization in an official communication.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be seen as serious violations of human rights”, added one of the leaders of Paul Legandr.
“The American Government may and must do more to deal with these crimes, adding that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
"Hate crimes" in the federal law are the legacy of the period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence involving race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation in our days.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes similar to Facebook
On Monday, the website of the Microblog has changed its platform to allow users, in particular, to see the activity of those they watch, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new "activities" and other "names" tab allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters", users whose messages ("tweets") you follow, and those who follow yours.
This provides an opportunity to know if they publish messages, if they sign up for new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "in a small percentage of users in August" before going out on a wide range of networks on Monday, AFP said Twitter's press secret Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as an intuitively rather vague and using rather vague terms (RT for the movement of someone else's message, #followfriday for the recommendation to track other users), is largely gratifying to experienced users, thus opening up to a wider audience, representing users something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation using "tweet" on the Internet.
"It's useless, it's unnecessary, and it's a cliché on Facebook."
Functional activity will help me to better monitor certain elements of my stream on Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the “gold rule” Constitution of the budget
The leadership of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write down the "gold rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible reductions by government credit rating agencies in Austria (Third A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrats Werner Faymann personally announced the decision at the end of the ministerial board meeting, while the Austrian State debt was 74.6 per cent higher than the upper threshold of 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty but below the State debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's ability to pay fell to just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an interest of three thousand million euros per year, the vice-canceller argument and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus complies with the requirement of the Eurozone Summit on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government required a reduction of budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts by Constitution or equivalent law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government refers to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt the "rule".
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), and the structural deficit of the federal State should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, and the land, like the commons, should be balanced budgets.
The aim is to impose a State debt below 60 per cent of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshiiko Noda
threatens new intervention in the currency market
Japanese Prime Minister Esihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would make new interventions in the currency market if the value of the yena continued to grow.
We intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate yen, Mr. Noda Senate explained.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost until the historic note that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for a large amount of dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new record of force since 1945.
Since then, however, there has been a constant increase in the purchases of investors who view it as a "refuge" in these sad times of economic downturns throughout the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbol board in 105 yen, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis for 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency damages Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products cheaper and reduces the income of Japanese firms abroad when converting to the national currency.
“Japan fights to recover” after the earthquake and tsunamis on 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (North-East), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that this growth would kill the fragile return.
Third in the world, the economic Power resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, due to the increase in exports and consumption of disaster-affected households
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect the “fundamental economic indicators of Japan”.
Minister of Finance June Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Managing Director of Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “the appropriate steps” to understand that no additional mitigation in the environment should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of cash bonds by 5,000 million euros (47 thousand euros) by up to 55,000 million euros (519 thousand euros) in the amount it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to fill the market in securities.
Eurozone
rates increase, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of a debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to grow
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, the European Stock Exchanges withdrew on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and ended trading at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
Because of the new difficulties in lending to countries in difficulty, the global fund markets continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Covered investors are simply too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker IG Markets quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a drop of 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market doubts about Europe's ability to hold a debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has sought to see Europe, and the stock exchange will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized," says Michucigue Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concern about the future eurozone is a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest mark in half a month.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the arrival of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDS party on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro without leaving the European Union together.
Italian and Spanish rates were significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level.
Today, Tuesday morning, the Italian 10-year-old bond income reached 6.85 per cent and the Spanish bond income reached 6.2 per cent at the same time.
This set of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continues to undermine the fear of the participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked for time in exchange to restore the situation in Italy under the burden of the paralysis.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the “core task” of his Government.
Spain was under attack before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The share of 10-year debt rates between Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for growth in the Eurozone
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised to reduce the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, has recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent for the same period.
The first euro area assessment is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is an energy policy.
The availability and value of electricity directly affect the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are a reason for thinking about the share and location of nuclear energy.
The gap will not produce any results until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are explored.
France should build its view on objective facts and rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic development will result in a double demand for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to meet the growing resource shortage in order to continue the production of electricity continuously, bearing in mind the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which is relying on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil are just a few of those who are firmly continuing their projects.
The United States decided to add one plant to its set after Fukusima, re-establishing the station, which was interrupted after the accident in Tri-Mail Island.
Although the model of Germany, based on renewable energy, is sometimes used as an example, the reality contradicts this argument.
The election of Berlin will result in an increase in the value of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, reinforced by the growing need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the rise in emissions of carbon dioxide from the construction of gas and coal stations.
A few months later, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
Denmark’s example should be considered.
The European Turbin Construction Championship, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is the largest carbon and gas user due to a break-in wind; therefore, emissions of carbon dioxide and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50% higher than on average in Europe.
On the other hand, because of the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more than the French households.
Since the globalised energy price is a key factor in competitiveness and the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will result in a significant increase in the value of electricity, which will make illustrative beautiful declarations about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay is because they do not oppose this kind of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create the industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410 000 indirects.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts the whole plaza of international trade of small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France had decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose €6,000 per year from French nuclear equipment and services exports.
What electric engineer will order EPR to work for sixty years if the closure of its manufacturer is planned?
In order to solve the equation of energy, it should be recognized that there are no divine or devilic sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Supporting the highest level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that conducts uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are filled with the same security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has survived three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mail Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental consequences.
In Montenegro, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error have led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that an accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this incident, as learned from the previous two.
The result of this step and the cooperation between security bodies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy specialists wishing to build a reactor, the construction of it in Flamanville will be a great gift to the competitors Areva and EDF, clearing them of the way to win leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and lawful to seek the best combination of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biases to be raised in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration - a burden or good for the economy?
Immigration policy with Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised by various parties - the transfer of police, judicial and administrative services, subject to figures policy and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as “human rights governments”.
Then there was an administrative concern for foreign students, which was released when the Minister of the Interior (Liberason of 23 May) said that France “does not need foreign talents, stones and officers”.
But it is very rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left in this matter are very agreed upon.
On the right hand side, Jacques Shirak, who said in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people will not be the problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left, Michel Rokar, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept poor people from all over the world”.
Distinction only at the level of generosity
In 2005, fear of invasion of the country was felt both by the left and by the right by Polish water managers.
Both sides see the burden of immigration for the French economy and for the French society.
The difference is only at the level of generosity that they will allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, François Holland was limited by the banals, he said that "cooperative work would enable us to solve our immigration problem."
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electric advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book, which summarises the latest data on immigration (especially people: How migration has formed our world and will determine our future, May 2011, the University of Princeton, 352 C.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The restriction of immigration has led to a weakening of growth and employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the assumption that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled, by promoting a reduction in wages.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are far more complementary than they are replacing local labour by doing work for which the local labour force is not enough.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job proposals.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrant sources has a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Jovanny Peri estimated that the increase in the migration rate would result in an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent of real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to new ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of the Nobel Prize's winners, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo, were all based on immigrants).
Migrants also have a net income in social security systems, with an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, when immigrants arrive at 30 years of age in Germany, their lives will result in a net income (income minus expenditure) of an average of €150,000.
In the beginning of his term of office, Nicola Sarkozy was about to fall into a lack of growth.
The said teeth that used to scare immigrants had a equally opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, continues to think European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time, it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that when it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedy of World War I, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, Gulag, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some felt that if democracy finally prevailed against its enemies, it would be enough to put a vote and make it as direct as possible.
From the time of Napoleon Smallo, it is known that this is due to the surface of the mind.
The general vote, although a mandatory condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become a "pressive tool", as some philosopher-Republican Etienne Yourro said.
No, democracy also requires many other public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the Palinody of a true-life Greek referendum will have a double-declaration effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the discomfort of its inability and inconsistency.
This duality must be thought to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the fight for democracy has now moved and many feel that the Republican soldiers are now not on that side.
We do not win anything by requiring a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart-Blanch" for an absolute European monarch or a leg-toe in the fall of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream about the guillotine lesion, but about the implementation - joint, clear and continuous - of choice and democracy, at this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and how many more will have to be listed because there is only one crisis - a crisis in Europe.
All over Europe is subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is totally humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of Europe's sovereignty, but Europe as a whole is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each nation.
A European project under popular sovereignty needs to be remanded urgently.
Because only by working together, Europeans will be able to reduce everyone's debt, get rid of the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The end of the crisis will require solutions at a pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, Socialists and Jacques Delor still require the European Economic Government.
Let it go.
But to represent it without stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which is in the city's lives, is a regular nonsense and a new stupidity.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to create a republic.
The revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a united Europe at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, the people of Europe.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
The uncontacted chip cards are being distributed more and more.
The World Chip Card show opens on Tuesday in Wilpente, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will result in an 11 per cent increase in world sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards), with more than 6 billion Eurosmart data.
The most important non-contact technology sector that allows public transport or purchase to be paid simply by holding a map over the counting device.
This year, 460 million non-contact chip cards will be sold worldwide against 320 million years ago!
Their share will rise in 2012 (expected to be 580 million units) and will account for almost 10% of the world’s chips market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been leaving the Asia-Pacific region for a long time, is now moving forward in the field of wireless payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards have already been provided with this function, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position: there are 400,000 visa-free cards.
But big stores are growing fast.
Carrefour released 2.5 million wireless Pass MasterCard this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, banks need to provide their customers with equipment.
"Two major organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute to their clients credit cards that are suitable for wireless use in the future," said Gerar Nebui, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But it's just the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, that's the mobile phone.
Only a few devices are equipped with the NFC technology (NFC) necessary for such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they must actually fly next year."
"We count on world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced that the experiment would be conducted from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone equipment will provide approximately 200 clients and staff with check-outs that provide wireless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing for the launch of a bid to allow customers to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spread from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now convinced of this.
“The capacity that these two organizations use and the reports of secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, not in detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
The investigation of the abduction of two French people in Niger in January revealed two binding calls.
The people abducted at the restaurant in Niamea, close to Aqmi, Antuan de Leakur and Vensan Delori, were apparently killed the following day along with several of the kidnappers during the operation by the French special units.
Among the incidents following the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone signs belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
A number of interviewees in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria were identified by the analysis of telephone calls.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who lives long in Majdiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the Boco Haram shackles, and the other points to a person as claimed to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt more reliable evidence to be expected before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect has received financial and ideal support outside and that it is becoming increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident by the actions and statements of Boco Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortals and the more complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community in head with Washington now puts pressure on Abuja to focus on the problems that Boko Haram creates.
The case is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of educated people who are not interested.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri, at the mosque, at the school, and with the founding of the fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuffe, Boko Haram, which means “Western education is a sin”, preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict compliance with the Sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the dishonest central government.
It is focused mainly on the churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Activists Boko Haram had shown special activity, committing numerous attacks on police offices.
Abuji's reaction is usually uncompromised.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, taken alive, was killed in prison.
The sect is now radicalizing and going beyond its northern limbs.
Last Christmas she took responsibility for the action, which resulted in the killing of 80 people in Jose and then another in Abuja.
In June, Abuja Boko Haram organized the first attack by the killer on a reinforced police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will become their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia concerns all security experts at present.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Niger and the Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a discussion with Presidents, Gudlak Jonathan Allen Zuppe warned about the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
Peace, as the Republican candidates see in the Presidents
With regard to China, Iran and assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are struggling with simplification and incompetence.
Can a weakened America crisis lead to a complex world through simple and more precise ideas?
If candidates were to be heard by the presidents of the Republic, voters could believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the details of foreign policy statements that are traditionally a strong side of the Republic.
Loungies related to China, Iran and Israel ' s assistance are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romni, who had the best chance of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened to file a complaint to the Chinese in the WTO and accuse them of "manipulation of their currency" -- a sensitive topic for America, which was fuelled by the migration of its entire industry in Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war," he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama to China, and the only candidate who understood a complex foreign policy, was unable to cope with the situation that affected the emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama's position).
But Hansman, who's holding in the lower part of the ratings, remained unheard.
Reagan-style
Romania has also pledged military strikes on Iran if sanctions cannot stop its nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I will stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel's military assistance, accusing Obama of not fulfilling his commitments to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second candidate in the rating, demonstrated a depressing ignorance of the case.
He recently called for a Chinese military threat because Beijing has been trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Governor Tehasa Rick Perry, who is supporting Israel and seeking military strikes in Iran, said that he was ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug addicts.
To avoid torture by suspected terrorists, which was prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michel Bachman.
This is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McKain, who is a serious foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President are saying that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won a cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to cut back on combating terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the early withdrawal of the "people" from Iraq, his captures in Libya, which had given him a reputation for a weak policy.
But it's not that simple.
The population considered the positive balance of national security in Obama, which had eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that binds in sand.
And by claiming that America needs to be restructured economically to restore its leadership, Obama's rights.
The North Stream, new gates to enter Russia's gas into Europe.
The North Stream pipeline, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is being launched.
It is estimated to be equivalent to 30 million households.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated in the Baltics last Tuesday, between the presentation of the orchestra and the search for snacks, opening the North Stream, a new pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
The Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francis Fiion and his Dutch colleague, Mart Rutte together returned a symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new pipeline of 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of gas will be flown every year to Western Europe by the first pipeline of 1,224 km, joining the Leningrad area from the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 cubic metres of gas equivalent to all consumption of France.
The possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with severe resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding transit through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries have lost some of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close up access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of Warsaw's debate, the North Stream was not compared to the new German-Soviet Pact, with the aim of bringing Poland to an alliance between Hitler and Stalin in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, Western Europe seeks to increase its security of supply.
But the cost of undermining Europe's energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been able to achieve its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already on the rise for less than five years.
"This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically binds us," said François Fion, opening the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lübmin, the point of gas arrival.
The construction of this gas pipeline is a technical milestone.
The underwater pipeline is made of a concrete-contained steel to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
In order to build it, it was necessary to leave behind the mines remaining in World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, the news secretary of the North Stream.
There was also a need to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Basins, with no cracks all over it, no valves and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the region of Sweden, but the project managers refused it, because Sweden was not in a hurry to see the Russian public company settle on its banks forever.
"In the event of an accident, we'll cross the gas stream less than a minute," says Jans Muller.
So, in the event of a gas leak in the gas pipeline, it's going to go into the air.
But this seems to be unlikely constructors who designed wires that are only expected to flow once in 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline will be carried out by a submarine that will drag the ship for external observation, as well as by the equipment circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigarette-shaped device is inserted within a 1 m diameter tube and is pushed forward by the gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed for work for 50 years without the need for minor repairs.
Gas circulation is carried out only through pressure.
It consists of 200 bar at departure and 100 bar at arrival.
Five companies joined efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which has 51 per cent of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called the North Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate the gas pipeline.
Its headquarters is located in Zug, Switzerland, where taxes are particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the total volume of gas transport.
"Gasprom will pay for the full amount, no matter how much gas will actually be transported," said Jans Muller.
Gas pipelines were financed by 30% of shareholders and by 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of work is 7.4 million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez will invest about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will buy their own expenses because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea to Lübmin on a sandy shore surrounded by pine trees.
The valves are 4.5 meters high, forming an output terminal of gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before switching it to the German gas pipelines.
From last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million hours in full and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine brandy
Moleskine, set up by the Italian company fifteen years ago, will taste the letter.
It has the aroma of adventures, the hours performed in the light of the light.
The Moleskine block is easy to find on the direct black cover, on the cut, on the yellow-white pages, like the ones who wish with time.
However, the Moleskine book, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to launch design blocks for sale.
Maria Sebregondi, a company consultant at the time, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The block is inspired by an old production technique, a mollusk, a lacquered boy cotton cloth, used for example to cover the sketches.
It is claimed that this type of notebook is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought in the taste of today's old and forgotten thing, which was culturally for avant-garde artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the dominant brand in Mode Mode.
Good luck with that.
Sales increased by 25 per cent from 2006 to 2010 and reached 12.7 million.
We have gone far away from the production of the first few years when all 3,000 block notes were made.
Moleskine crossed the border of Italy and was exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer because the blocknote is equally attractive to businessmen, students and people in a free profession.
Buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, have broad views and education.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 staff, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributed her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in small towns and was able to acquire a wide range of knowledge.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need in the letter, despite the emergence of an e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural pattern is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand has recently organized the exhibition "Around Way", where architects and artists have demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also launched a screenplay with a leopard painting on the case of a film festival in Locarno.
With its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has varied its products, which now include bags, gloves, computer bags. Brand includes all types of support.
The success that gave rise to envy: in autumn 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which entered a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is unemployment among disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public welfare policy launched in 2005, the proportion of unemployment among persons with disabilities remains twice as high as 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Is it refreshing?
“No,” says Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, who organizes a week of employment for persons with disabilities.”
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not 2 times as much as 3 times as the unemployment rate."
"All the same, there's a lot more work to do."
It must be said that many obstacles to employment still exist for the disabled.
Among them are older: 37% over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a lower level of qualification: 80 per cent do not have a baccalaure level, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 people with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread, which accounts for 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, all these criteria make it very difficult to get back to work and are a major problem," said Christian Grapen, Director General of Tremplín, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality that changes, but too slowly.
The study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise association on Cité's order showed that the managers in question had a low level of knowledge of disability and “represented themselves as general people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally incomplete”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far away from the target of 6 per cent of persons with disabilities, as set out in the law adopted in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 amount to 2.6%.
"Today we are about 3%," says Pierre Blan, Director General Agefiph, organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “discharged” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, fell from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which raised taxes, created a strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects increased awareness, particularly in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of workers' organizations from 20 to 49 have workers with disabilities against 82 per cent of workers' organizations from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What luck."
Before meeting Sini on Tuesday evening (20.45 p.m.) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We won't come to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting near the stadium of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar were at peace.
Five months later, a Belgian coach can only commend his attacker against Turkey.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to go on," said Lilly.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the assembly, that's the whole thing, he's justified.
"I'm in Lille for a round year, and there's no Belgium."
"I have to make my eyes."
Left in stock, in front of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar came to St. Danny to finally "blush".
Not forgetting, however, the concept of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the particular character of the match.
And especially of what is on the other side, Mother (Debushi), John (Caba) and Adil (Ramma)," he remembers.
"Our paths have just crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly reminded me of pride.
"Glorious" to play in the "festival" game.
"Gloriousness" is also to claim as "neighbor", that France "was once again a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Niezna.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the technical sportsman will fly in a plane with the lead of the blues... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We build something, the games are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll make sure of this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident of itself
Portugal, Paul Bentou, starts its response match against Bosnia (22.00 a.m.) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On his way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Benthu is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He had no doubt that the Assembly, in its role since September 2010, would qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal's only in 90 minutes of luck.
But there's a match to be played, and Bosnia to win.
In view of the 0-0 on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it was unable to reach the goal of calming her down.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk."
But at his brightly lit de la lus stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will go through, in the eyes of the audience, who should be in a hurry, although the match will be very tense," said optimistically, but sensible Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 per cent chance of getting to the Euro in 2012," deputy Carlos Cairo said.
No one on Friday in a match against Bosnia demands the Portuguese victory.
No one could set up Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk, but it's a pity for Bent.
"We will play against a team with a lot of technical merit and a lot of individual merit," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, only this time would be realistic.
