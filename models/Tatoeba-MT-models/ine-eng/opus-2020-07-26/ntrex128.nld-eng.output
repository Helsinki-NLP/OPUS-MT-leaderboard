Members of the National Assembly of Wales were concerned that they would be ‘compared to Muppets’
A proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament) is under way among the members of the National Assembly of Wales.
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will become ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP is ‘stirring on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for mad and pwp is Welsh for pop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole was 'satisfied' and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party 'open' for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet look very similar.
In this context the Welsh letter W is expressed as a short you.
The Committee of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently in the process of drafting legislation to carry out the name change, said, 'Of course, it is the members of the National Assembly of Wales itself who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be converted to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching a consensus, and in a few weeks she will have to submit a bill on the changes.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way in which the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will definitely be able to vote on their new title when discussing legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, voters vote or wish to change the name of their country in 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to settle an insurmountable dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the National Council on Name Change, said that he will not take account of the outcome of the referendum.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The hours of Saint Martin's silence, Harlem's having it hard
“The older people I spoke to said that there was a café and a church in every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be found.'
He said it's understandable that the cafes were gone.
‘People now have other social contact,’ he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people regularly walk away.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less prolonged if the leaders expect, ‘and they will be back early or late at the beginning’.
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining types of shelter nearby.
‘The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be blank,’ he says, ‘which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church community of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church in the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church community led by Eervalde John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks but rarely could get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Honor Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beaver.
Honor David Johnson, the son of Honor Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beaard 'the watches of the poor'.
The expert who played the beaard in July referred in another way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beaver in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger beaver of the Riverside Church.
Dr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some rented by the parishioners of the church, others by the church.
The Consistency (the governing body of the parish, consisting of laymen) wrote the bishop in July to express her concern that the bishop 'would like to calculate the costs' to the Consistency, although the Consistency was not involved in renting the architects and contractors who had sent the bishops.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Haai injured 13-year-olds who went to cancer in California
Saturday, on the first day of the fall season, a shark fell on a 13-year-old boy who fell asleep in California. The boy suffered injuries, as it says.
The attack took place just 7 hours in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that on Saturday he had slept with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he walked to the boy to draw him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy cried because he had caught a trap, but then he realized ‘that the boy cried, ‘I prayed!
I'm praying!'
His keybone was completely open,' Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
‘I screamed that everyone had to leave the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he claims to be in danger of life.
It is not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a few weeks earlier there was a shark in the neighborhood, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed the access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and security.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury wants to cross the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams and directs beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in wholesale stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops across the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be introduced into more shops next year.
Investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the networks where TVs, microwaves and interior items were ever present with other products.
Sainsbury wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including branding for the first time like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also takes place more, with exhibition space per brand, as in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up again on the market, now most products are suitable for veganists, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first is opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and more often on a daily basis buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says the shops will increasingly look like large store houses, now the supermarket chain is recording it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since the two chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have increased yield.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Apothek a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's began to test out cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated when a conflict arose about the distribution of pharmaceutical incomes in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacies in the shops three years ago for an amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding a wide range of skin care luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the setting up of our beauty department, so that it is more pleasant to our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer everything we want, and thanks to the attractive environment and the convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer buy in the old way.'
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby withdraws from 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is "suffering" because TV-presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for True, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is excited about Holly Willoughby, because at the last moment she withdrew from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘suffering’ when Willoughby Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the headquarters of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that she did not spend enough time for True, her brand for homewear and accessories through her new contracts (with a value of another half million pounds).
The company will be compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and would hopefully double Willoughby's fortune from an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones left one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure her long-term future, and deliver enough for the next decade.
Everyone was bluffed when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was soon planned.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions, as a result of major investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now take place further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on holiday and Jones has a 40% share in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby will soon be M&S brand ambassador and Ant McPartlin will be replaced as presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business matters.’
Hard Language “Then Love Was Between Us ”
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media about a comment he made that some people would find 'unappropriate to a president' and about his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a new singer when he said:
‘I didn’t give up.’
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the disarmament of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
However, negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have taken place.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho from North Korea told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a ‘consistent reaction’ by the United States following the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States is going through its sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
'We're doing very well in North Korea,' he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim led to positive results, the missile tests were completed, the hostages were released, and the material surpluses of American soldiers were returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to gain access to this pressing arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” said Trump, while he was in front of the public.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy an island with hundreds of deaths
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had no more housing, there was no national disaster, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
‘In many cases it is clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,’ said Mrs Sumbun.
Save the Children is working with a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure whether the foreign aid providers can work in the place.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still involved in assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to assist.
Although Indonesia is constantly being hit by earthquakes, the country is still very badly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh shelters were built to slide at tsunamis, but along other coasts you see them rarely.
The fact that no warning sirens for tsunamis were present in Palu, even though there was a warning of force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal circumstances it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship authorized in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's unprecedented infrastructure was one of the core points of the election campaign by President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko has a lack of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are now following a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic bands fought on the street, with machetes, arrows and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge managed Liverpool last Saturday to lose against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team stood behind with 1-0.
He turned left against the ball and then jumped in the direction of the worst pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty zone, towards the top right corner of the net.
He developed the spring of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,’ Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Edge approaching and waiting for an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just jumped on the ball.’
Chelsea was at rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The top of The Blues shot the ball with its whole to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the middle of the field to Liverpool's playground.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet in the middle of the village.
After that, he gave a beautiful passport, which enabled Hazard to reach the area of the crime scene.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alison Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group phase of the Champions League against Naples, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes up the Thursday at 3 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the Agency said on Sunday morning for assistance in national disasters.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 last Friday, with also waves coming from 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruined buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was killed
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has just begun, but I want everyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious about us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact them if they may have filmed something via a Dashcam. They can have information that is essential to our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends came to think they knew the woman on the spot to ask questions about the place she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have confirmed that they are currently bringing the victim's family to the attention.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was rude when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She just keeps repeating, ‘What's wrong!’.
At 2:00 a.m., two police cars were in the parking lot and a third was just outside.
A number of agents kept the apartment building in check.
Those who have information are asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111, including log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's stand at the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' rail
The banning of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of the many cultural and religious objects of art carried out by its fanatic puritanic followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Dr. Crick's suggestion as 'wash' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the visualization of Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclass of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that rule in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, is still to be recognized.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely correct presentation, it is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that hole.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and respected.'
Killing Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, only known as ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province. His slogan was crossed and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to enter pigs at a pig stable on 30 May 2005, in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He was supposed to have been away from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pig stable to be open.
According to the nephew, there was a large male pig with blood on his neck in the stomach.
A forensic study showed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the farmer, so the report.
‘The legs of my cousin were bleeding and mutilated,’ said the cousin with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Images of surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal the man killed was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the other attack, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for their death.
It happens rarely, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can trigger.
‘They are just games.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not out there to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rains to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has now reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and to the south-west.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday morning at 5 o'clock local time and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it begins to form a fortress above the Pacific, which moves east towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed north, to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trunk will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, torrents and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
However, 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapid deterioration, as tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is most strongly ordered to walk into the desert when the tropical rain falls.
The heavy rainfall can turn rains into desert rivers, and the storm will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trunk brings a few heavy rains locally to parts of the coast line of Southern California.
There are rains of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small torrents and smooth roads.
This would be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Dispersed tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday morning, followed by the rains at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners Tuesday and continue to fall on Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can fluctuate strongly, because the North Pole is getting colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In most of the central and eastern parts of the U.S. would be expected to start hot in October, with temperatures ranging around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
In New York, it can become 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance to mid-October is high at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people look at one of the six television networks at Brett Kavanaugh's impressive testimony, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that claimed to have occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, while calling for regular programming to be interrupted for the surprise of Friday: an agreement by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, was scheduled to investigate the prosecution for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee for Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh robbed her and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a well-known witness that he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have been seen on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to have trouble with the number of people looking in an office.
For comparison: this is about as for a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar release.
Fox News Channel, which supports the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: on average 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public was very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican stated that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras registered on Friday morning that the defendants yelled at him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with his eyes down while he was ridiculed, live on CNN.
'I'm right here for you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he is telling the people the truth?
Someone cried, ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various senders sent everything out alive when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote in favour only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee against the next week, something that the minority Democrats insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were critical of her plans to leave the European Union 'a political game' with the future of Britain and the undermining of national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In a further interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should charge each other was 'absurd'.
Shooting Party Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot to death.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities produced a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, WAFB reports, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The bodyguard of the congregation in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the South University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation leading to a arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘business and striving for justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He won on average 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was 'kapot' and 'in shock' by Waydes dead.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen”, Wade says.
Plucking up Mexico City
The axis that is emitted by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center detected several times a roll and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer appear as on autopathies in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south-east of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake of 7.1 on the scale of Richter Central Mexico met.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police listen to Catalan separatists on the evening of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after pro-independence activists successfully hit the opposition police, while thousands of participants were taking part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote in Catalonia, which affected the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were opposed by the opportunistic police, sheltered the agents with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds to arise in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, the police fired shields, and the agents pulled their fists up to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents shout ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions remain high in the independent region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the appearance was low and the people who opposed separation were boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, where it came to violent screens.
Pro-independence groups had camped on Saturday night on the spot to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration went on, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who accompanied his wife in the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful of Catalonia's prospects for independence.
“Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won a major victory in the regional elections in December, even though that was not the case, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success. Many of their most well-known leaders are absent, either in exile themselves or in prison, awaiting their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old montour who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict by politicians was on both sides.
‘The tensions are getting higher,’ he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional detention since last year, declared that he is taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after home was robbed by a car
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was raided repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building themselves had been damaged.
Maybe at a given time a cross-bow was also fired on the car.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga target
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to the same height as Hibernate.
Gerrards team failed this season to win a race during the Premiership. They have to record the Sunday against Leader Hearts, who holds eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston remains unsuccessful. The team has already won six matches in his department, and Coach Holt hasn't had any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against strong visitors
Holt's team had been able to make a move for the first time. Their direct way of playing, however, took care of all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball over the target.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and self-insuranced.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers left a free step and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the criminal field.
At that time, the Rangers had had a long time, but the defense of the home team was unmistakable and targetman Liam Kelly didn't have much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had a goal to avoid.
Scott Pittman shot the ball at the feet of Rangers targetman Allan McGregor and Lithgov lost the target after a speech by his colleagues from Livingstone.
They always reached the scene of Livingston's crime scene, but they were turned over every time. Twice a criminal trial was refused, one after Halket's attack on the invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's Phenomenal - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingstone.
They played excellent without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playstyle and composition of their team has almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but in particular Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has developed the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The leader Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were running during the entire match at the tops of their teeth.
However, the Rangers did not know how to break through.
Even though they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only managed to slip the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better. They are somewhere in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a shining blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together Saturday (29 September) breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Cologne is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they asked the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathetic people came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, also heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the disunity of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: biker dies after collision with car
In London a biker died at a collision involving a car.
The accident took place near the intersection of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago another bike died in an accident with a flight accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident of Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were about to identify the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed in different places, buses are being redirected and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Cypriots injured in order disorder
Six Cypriots were injured in an order disorder in a severely secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still in progress.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ pills are used to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one section.
The Cypriots were treated for light injuries in the face.
One spokesperson of the Prisoner said: ‘It is specially trained prison personnel employed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and in any case the perpetrators are being referred to the police and perhaps need to remain behind the trails.'
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals, remain in HMP Long Lartin.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were summoned to prison for a serious order disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen next week.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for Monday and Tuesday for sudden floods to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and to the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday evening it will rain already.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm down, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the south-west of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes, will probably get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rains of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of this rainfall will probably be favorable, as the south-west is currently going through a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought zones are indicated makes more than 40% of Arizona at least extreme drought, the reported after the highest category,' weather.com.
The route of hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the peninsula Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa is still at an orca level at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits colder waters in the Pacific, causing them to weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
There may be heavy rains in parts of Mexico, which entails a significant flood risk.
‘Average of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ said weather.com.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before Tuesday morning she reaches the border with Arizona as a tropical depression, which will then take place on Tuesday evening by Arizona and in the south of Utah.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern of the desert area," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to result in life-threatening sudden floods and storms in the deserts and earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was injured at about 4 hours local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area at night, so the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has been amongst the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unmistakable and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh has constantly 'beyond the common, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday for the Congress, and she strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's statement that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her statement.
On Saturday, the president said that the 'American people's 'beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage' of Kavanaugh saw that day.
‘A voice to recognise Judge Kavanaugh is a voice with which one of the most complete legal opinions of our time is acknowledged, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,’ he told the many advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance in the interim elections.
‘Over five weeks one of the most important elections takes place in our lives.
I don't take part, but actually I take part,' he said.
‘That's why I come all over for great candidates.’
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'stand up and block us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be expected to take place on Friday, a top member of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths by Indonesian earthquakes, tsunamis, and tolls are increasing
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many of the land being swept away when giant waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when waves of six feet high hit the ground at the time it started to tremble. Many people dropped to the ground and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk straight away and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Bureau for aid in natural disasters BNPB during a letter in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses with him, he hit everything on the ground,' Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was travelling at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before reaching the coastline.
Some people climb into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On air photos released by the disaster relief office, many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges destroyed and destroyed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was swept away by shocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released at the huge Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has even increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “great” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
Some fatal victims were trapped under the ruins of ruined buildings, he said, so 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongalla, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donghala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all’, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organisation received a lot of criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, it is heard how a man on the top floor of a building screams panick at people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
A few minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and is built and cars flown together.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major flood that cut the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuations still have an urgent need for food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is open only for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami dodentol rises above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the World Vision staff from Donghala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the interior of their office search undercover in tents of December, but passing on the way taverns of destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is called into question as a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a disaster at provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says ‘O.K., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been proclaimed.’
When the second night after the earthquake and Friday tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing people hoped that they would regain their loved ones, as in the miracles that people like to hear in terrible natural disasters like these.
Saturday, a boy was taken out of a river.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been trapped for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also found at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandadi.
‘As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional tax,’ he said.
Dr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
However, only one gray angle appeared in his messages instead of two blue angles.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while saving cash machine in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, 26.750 dollars were stolen from an employee of Brink who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press report from the Newport police.
The driver had just put a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, as inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects flying, so the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name in Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘It is that it is formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been briefly named Ye and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the show's creator.
You are not only abbreviation of his current artist name. Instead, West told all that the word has a religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'', West said earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album by Radiopresenter Big Boy.
‘I am you, I am us, we are.
I've been transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has already worked with and without the link and the letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military power against citizens. The country stands on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military troops were on a peaceful march in the square, killing 300 people. During that period, left student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
The United States must double the funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research by A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this because of the announcements about A.I. coming from different departments of the American government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030 the country wants the number 1 to be at the level of A.I. innovations.
‘To double the research budget to A.I. would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.’, Lee said.
A duplication of funding can lead to a duplication of the possibility of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player in American Othello, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Google Department.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place because it would help discover the next visionaries.
In the US researchers often have to work hard to obtain public subsidies, Lee said.
‘China doesn’t pick up our best academics, companies do that’, Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have acquired the best powers of universities to work with A.I..
Lee said that American efforts at A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“The doctor at the level of A.I. should automatically receive a green card”, he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences grants financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other public organizations lend money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence launched a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and the academic world at the initiative, and announced the formation of the Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Limited Committee for Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the American legislation which should lead to the establishment of a National Committee of Safety for Artificial Intelligence has been in the loop for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country in 'North Macedonia', thereby a dispute with Greece that has been resolved for decades and that Greece would no longer impede the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province, also known as Macedonia, and says that the name of its north-east neighbour contains the country's responsibility for Greek territory, and thus Greece has its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and by a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rise will be achieved at least 50 per cent, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: ‘Are you a proponent of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?’
‘The leaders of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth the effort to try to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that arose when the former Yugoslavia collapsed.
"I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, which will determine it.
The name change would require a second-democracy in Parliament.
The National Elections Committee said that at 1 p.m. there were no reports of irregularities.
At that time, however, it was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voters in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the country's name change that would open the way for NATO and European Union membership.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that were placed by people who were boycotting the referendum.
"We are the proponents of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will make necessary investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
'I am convinced that the overwhelming majority is more favourable, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are supporters of the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after delivering his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required occurrence.
From another painting, performed by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 per cent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent would vote.
If the referendum is to be successful, the appearance must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-western government since it came into power last May.
Look at: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short matches with Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the 2-0 match.
It looked like a flush of a cent, like Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak first got the ball played in the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defense guard and was too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's crime scene.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty zone to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat target man Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has trouble with his feet,’ coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That was in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's field.
He sent a beautiful stick pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball close and then sent Sterling to the second floor.
The Sky Blues player picked up the ball just before he was too far away.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoppenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The match takes place in the Rhein-Neckar Arena in the German Sensheim.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn't make the Rockies easy to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was not much reason to force a new start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to play against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the participation of the Rockies at the playoff. They are currently playing one game at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least approved a game-off wild card due to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to put everything into work to ensure their first section title.
‘Although there is nothing more for us, we can at least point with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team is probably playing at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play with it?
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but have been reluctant to set up Scherzer as a painter in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although normally his rest day.
Washington's right-hand warp is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump organizes a meeting in West Virginia
The president referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance in the interim elections.
‘Everything we have already accomplished is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections will take place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't take part, but actually I do. That's why I come all over for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take back the power, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that.'
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "stand up and stop us".
‘And we have seen that in the last four days,’ he said, calling the Democrats ‘bad and common and false and false’.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Justice Committee, which led to a loud public call.
‘Do you know what she said?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.'
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
Finally, I'm the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who get that we're not welcome, just because we're saying what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she resolved against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motive for censorship because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of irony, of such issues as this, where Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.'
And that was so during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I was already a Labour Parliament member.
Unfortunately, today it is not the show of many meetings and the promise of a 'serious, softer' politics has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a derogation opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable to the Party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I did, suddenly expected me to turn around and take up a position that I would never otherwise have agreed on, from issues such as national security to the European unity market.
Even when I speak to a public, as I say, there are slum parties on social media calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a member of parliament for the following elections, which undermines the policy of the centre and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address are about general politics.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have every day to deal with a flood of sexual or racist reactions, but do not be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of policy is that heavy slump parties appear to be considered as normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘cause of mistrust’ or change of selection rules, the party is getting smaller.
I have often received the opinion in the last two years to keep me informed, not just to announce my opinion, and then I would ‘not be in trouble’.
But I did not go into politics for that.
Since 32 years ago, as a school child, I was a member of Labour, provoked by the neglect of thatcher's government, which literally disrupted my classroom, I have always prayed for better public services for those who need it most, both in my role as a council member and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my policy hidden, not during the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my disputes with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are now a member of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a member of parliament for the following elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting in accordance with what I believe is in your interest.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Accidents Air on the way to the top
Two late trials may have pulled the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr is right to triumph in this great game of the day in the Tennant's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the classification, the only accident team of the ten.
Finally, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that the home team provided the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was pleased.
“We’ve had a hard time in our fights so far, and we’re still unlucky, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robin Christie van Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we do.’
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish National Team (which he received during the Warriors' match) Melrose was able to put the figures to speak and Jason Baggot was able to break a trial.
Climo provided an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry net for the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The game was a long time in silence for a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, which was performed on a branch card, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr could continue through a trial by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion by Climo.
Then the leader, Blair Macpherson of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again counted Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed on a trial by Bruce Colvine at the end of a match with the pressure very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he picked Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the racing Ayr-mau for a touch-down on the penalty line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and halfback sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Ster van Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran is leaving Still Game in the choir. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next nine series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craiglang is already planning.
According to official data, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘bloody restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is of us': the country included in Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Zeeliui patrols in a testifying marine office in La Paz.
At public buildings, an ocean blue flag is armed.
On all the marine bases of the Titicacameer to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
In the whole of the country surrounding Bolivia, the reminder of the coastal line that the country had to withdraw from Chile after a bloody Nineteenth-century conflict of raw materials is still alive, just as the wish to preserve the Pacific again.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last decade, since Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of consultation.
‘Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the judgment of the Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Hague tribunal in favour of Bolivia will plead that Chile, after decades of grueling talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial fight for re-election, is much at stake with the statement of Monday.
‘We are very close to the return to the Pacific,’ he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the Court will probably not decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and even if that were the case, there would be little change.
The United Nations agency established in the Netherlands does not have the power to recognise the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the conclusion, states that the case was ‘not complex’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the past four years, the situation may have become even worse.
‘The case around the access to the sea is captured by the current Bolivian government,’ Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good wishes that Chile might have had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk later.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision has been made unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will “have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period of international relations with Chile” and a chance to “end a 139 year of differences of opinion, with mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind us.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is not possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust it.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the moment that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the ongoing nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's a 'autopie' that the continued sanctions and the American objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without first putting important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would deny an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head coverings, soon to buy near you
If you want to expand your range collection or keep the sun completely out of your sight, do not search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a series of crazy oversized head coverings for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a remarkable set during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical guards were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers sent their blinding creatures to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a four-dimensional wide edge, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with precious stones, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks the lips were closed. They looked more on Hannibal Lecter than on high couture.
One creature looked like a duke suit, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a molten ice.
And if you want to follow this stubborn fashion, you're lucky.
Stylwatchers predict that the huge guards will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-metre wide edge that all carry, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a narrow beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bath pack that accompanied the bag.
The reddore raffia bag, set off with raffia francs and finished with a white leather hanger, was the most outstanding piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large coats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the question of extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a number of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for continued and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects in excellent schools.
Nelson Mandela said, ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot trust only in English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's review, we can derive that languages are listed above, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
Data gathered from 74 schools associated with SCIS show that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the German students, 69 percent of the French students, and 63 percent of the Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now being valued as highly as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey revealed that 17% of the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Thus language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more language skills are required, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, when he has learned a second language, he has a real benefit in the future with such skills for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov score of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language above 10%, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages, in particular those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach which are most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools set up to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At the moment it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has to be determined how many minutes he will play.
‘There will be more than one, and less than 48,’ said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' scheme for the six games prior to the season.
‘At this stage of my career, I don’t need any competition before the season to prepare for me,’ he said.
Periods of election rallys from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallys
It is the first of the five planned rallys of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that are related to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he elects for the vacancy in the Supreme Court is pending, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming interim elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when it is voted in November.
How late does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how are you looking online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 o'clock.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably have the hearings for the candidate-up judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were additionally charged now Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of Rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more of it.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallys are intended to ‘stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect, expand and protect the majority they have in the Senate and House of Members’, so Reuters.
‘Control of Congress is so important for its programme that the president travels to as many states as possible to start the printed campaign season,’ said a spokesman of the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned against Reuters.
The rally of tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and are discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the stakes.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the stakes," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the run to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The slender of opportunities is a fully invented sport concept, but a place where players really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
"They had a lead of six points first, and now that's four more, so we find a little bit that happiness is on our side," said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of standing four points, while there are 12 still in play.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four.
Speeth was a fearsome opponent from tea to green and he set the right example.
The typical keel sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his rounds progressed and he achieved a crucial well with which four matches were a success when he and Thomas were behind two points after two matches.
His post with which they won the game on 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind that you can draw from that he believes the American team has not yet been reported.
"You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but glorious European duo has four to four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that no bogey played Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their curious audience, they are the players that should be reported Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who wins a European victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
Both prefer different holes at the same time.
However, it is a warning to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short matches with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front of the nine led to a backdrop for the Spaniard and the Swedish that they did not get over.
Sunday, however, there's no one who can help get your back.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the opinion they give, the opinion they do not give, and the way in which a strategy can be changed.
So far, the European team has played its best and has made a fine lead in the course of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team is willing to go on fighting, something that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a great lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and four-balls of Saturday they stand in the United States with 10-6.
The seasoned duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which had a hard time, making them four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trophy they wanted to lose in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the dazzling Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer get his back.
The team of Jim Furyk has to score eight points during the 12 singles games of Sunday in order to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points on row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname ‘Molliwood’ after a sensational weekend, are the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening competitions.
After they had joined Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully played on each other and defeated a disappointing Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, showed off and then a beautiful set, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-somes and seven on row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it was not a rented roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas, with three points, set the standard for the Americans on Saturday.
They won 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to pick up a backdrop of four points at the start of the singles, although the team of Fury has enough matches, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, it seems like an attack on Sunday is too high.
North Korea says it will 'in no case' untrustworthyly unarmed
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions lead to increasing mistrust in the United States and that the country could not, under such circumstances, give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken 'significant goodwill measures' in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘We do not see any corresponding US response,’ he said.
‘Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not be able to unarm ourselves unilaterally.’
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a 'phased' approach to denouncing, which would reward North Korea as the next step, it turned out that he did not reject unilateral denouncing a priori, as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the 'denuclearization of the Korean peninsula' while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington also objected to the call for strong international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve their purpose in a forceful way and even object to the 'explanation of the end of war', Ri said.
‘The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an air castle of people who are unaware of us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions will only strengthen our confidence.'
Ri did not report plans for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which the American leader did earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party on this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
However, Ri's speech was significantly different than last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets on the US continent would be directed after 'Mr. Evil President' Trump called 'a rocketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that there was still much to be done and that the sanctions should continue to denuclearize North Korea.
Wednesday Trump said he had no schedule for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must reward the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued strongly and firmly until we have achieved the complete, final, verified denuclearization.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has carried out unanimous sanctions against North Korea to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after leaving Pyongyang in July and saying that progress had been made, North Korea told him to put 'passive demands'.
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take 'agreemental measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'agreemental measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and were taking steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor found that the students of the world's largest university often had no idea of the basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. For as far as he knows, this is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start with the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleeplessness on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I getting to hear this right now, in my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is organised this year for the first time, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits improve academic and athletic performance and how they promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health services of the university, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep deficit during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performances are influenced by sleep deficits, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
By means of a platform of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the student's behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of the choice for cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of celebration at night still exists, he says, and thanks to modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleeplessness is an ever-increasing problem.
Taking care of adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because the lack of sleep ensures that the brain gives them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course. He had been studying at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study programme before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their age, and not just an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can trigger your circadiaan rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to take down the men of Gerrard
The Rangers saw their race run again disappointingly when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingstone.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a race since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team now holds eight points behind Hearts, which further run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes for rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingstone rises to the third, with only a difference in the number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more problems, since the border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a headache after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitors' supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They passed Air and went to the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained at the same 11th for Livingstone, who knew a point to cut off the Hearts last week. He would have been up on the way his well-trained team would have tried to block the opponents at every set.
The Rangers may have had the most whales, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga released the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vision, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free step from Keaghan Jacobs reached the leader Craig Halkett, but his colleague-defender Alan Lithgow jumped against the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than believe in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found that he had the right to a fine when he and Steven Lawless were fighting after a quarter, but Judge Steven Thomson denied the Colombian request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former target man at the Ibrox, was able to withstand Lassana Coulibally's headball and Ovie Ejaria's small shot with ease.
The opening of Livingstone in the 34th minute may or may not be in the extension of the general game course, no one can deny that they deserved this, even though it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not raised against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold and chosen Menga, who easily hit the ball in the goal.
Gerrard took care of a break with the change Coulibally/Ryan Kent. This set had almost immediate consequences when the bird player passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly race from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston kept the visitors forced to play one of the kind of game that Livingstone likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett standing long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last phase of the game, but McGregor held a good stand and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgov came from the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a fine after an assault with Jacobs at the end of the match, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the Almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': September 30, 1882, today just 136 years ago, for whom can it be good... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device named Geigerteller.
Since then, the geigert has not been thinking about science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans at first sight:
Man: ‘What in the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘This is a geiger counter. It is used to trace radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you will hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: ‘It’s a real joke now!’
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name remains relevant.

The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to convert them into a laboratory.
They can then see a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and then are injected again.
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells saw her egg pancreas disappear for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which often occurs in all types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung cancer and colon cancer, presented Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn these cells’ to treat cancer cells has been shown to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West hides pro-Trump-thirade and carries MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he hoped.
Kanye West was shown during a Saturday Night Live broadcast following an inconsistency event in which he awarded US President Donald Trump and said he would become a presidential candidate in 2020.
After he had brought his third issue of the evening, Ghost Town, with a pet on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he pulled off a triad against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘When I talk to a white man, she asks, ‘How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He is a racist!’
When I was worried about racism, I was out of America for a long time, he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon threw the dragon at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged assault on which Christine Blasey Ford accused him.
The tirad of West was not sent out, but comical Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to hit the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstages under fire for his pet.
‘They have driven me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t step on the stage with that pet.’
They fucked me up!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said he would attract her superman-cape, ‘for that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love.'
From the audience, at least twice a book call came, and the castes of SNL appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by an audience: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was too guest as last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with an implementation of the number I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier-Flesche.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our most courageous spirits: RECOGNISED YOU THE MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talk show-presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘usually himself, and that's wonderful.'
‘But I choose to reward someone who is an ideology that damages, supports, and exhausts my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too, she added.
Before the show began, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collegiate rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the deceased musical Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then in The Artist formally known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill after a man was found in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The complainant is expected to appear on Monday before the police judge in Belfast.
The charge will be investigated by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington leads to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow knight in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor draws up the stereotype of the macho hat and says that young boys often think that they should be stuttered to get respect when watching such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that he felt that “there was something wrong” and wondered how the problem of toxic manhood should be addressed in the time of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is a very important question for me at the moment: where did it go wrong with our humanity?' he said.
"What did we learn from men when they grew up, so that we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic manhood, due to its very male characters.
He continued, ‘What was born and what was taught?’
What is taught on TV and on the street that young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong with young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series ended next summer, because he is “clear with battlefields and horses”.
From November, Kit plays with him in a Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is the conqueror.
The actor recently revealed that he finds his encounter with his wife Rose the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I've met my wife during the show, so that's how I've kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of Leslies family in Scotland.
Hiv/aids: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was previously not so.
In the past, HIV has rapidly spread in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who are living in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said during a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reportedly widespread.
According to studies estimates, between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and leads to 'dangerous lies' and 'comploit theories'
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters goes against the allegations that one of its staff members has placed the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the charges are distributed by ‘extreme rights’ opinions and websites.
‘Lithuanian lies, lies, and more common lies’, Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published data would include the private address and phone number of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate committee on the charges of sexual misconduct to Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts is linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a staff member of Waters, said the Hill.
"This unwarranted accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unwarranted accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.'
Waters' statement has already been criticized online, including by former press officer of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds evil’, Fleischer wrote.
‘From here you can open that she does not have the temper to be a Congressman.
If a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He doesn't have to be rebellious.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive evil by critics during Thursday's hearing.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the interim elections, gave his opinion on Twitter.
'Sure, if it's true,' he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false charges.
"We will make the perpetrators known," she said, "and that they are legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff members."
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and this is indeed true to apply to this Revival of Johnny English-French, the comic action films with a slow spy in the main drowl, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was called back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satisfied about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with eye-catching eyes and flexible sights manages to send everything in a hundred, including with his second comeback. From his name you can already conclude that he is a general comic character that was considered for bioscopists in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamorous, a little Clouseau, a leg of Mr Bean and a little of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is originally based on the traveller and the international mysterious man Atkinson ever played in Barclaycard's TV spots (who are all forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain mess.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval arms suit and the rotor blades just against his helmet ticks.
Atkinson can show how much he has talent for physical comedy in this film, but the humour is rather weak and crazy enough, especially now the "nurst" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humour seems to be intended for children rather than for adults, and the doll disaster of Johnny English is less original and focused on me than the jokes without the text of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme is now that Britain is experiencing great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making it known the identity of all active secret agents of Britain, to the great disengagement of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the hammer pass through the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her very best with this character that makes Teresa May think, but the script does not provide much material to work with.
According to her information advisors, she has to employ a retired spy because each active spy has been compromised.
And that means the sprinting Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spies of English who think of School or Rock.
English is quickly released on Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former pitiful helper Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a submarine, an amazing and jubilant role under Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty female fatal Ophelia Bulletin.
In the meantime, the prime minister is unfortunately concerned with the charms of the charismatic technology millennium that he claims to be able to solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start off on their odyssey of funny doll fun: dressed as workers they burn a cautious French restaurant, they kick ladyship on board the luxury of Volta and English reveals pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
To that end, all the registers are opened, but how well-intentioned and unscrupulous the scene is, she does what she thinks of child television.
It's not all very original.
And like the other movies of Johnny English, I am asking myself: can the British film sector really not think of any role that affects Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour rejects the fact that the party is planning to work four days a week, but is paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan in which Britain works four days a week but gets paid for five days.
The party would like to submit to their employees the savings they make as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence (A.I.) by giving them an extra day of vacation.
In this way, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn a lot.
According to sources, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to balance the country is ‘past’ in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a working week of four days has already been approved by the Trade Unions Agreement, which considers it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A top source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one moment to the other, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits in the party's efforts to make the balance in the economy more beneficial to the workers and that fits in the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
One Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not the party's policy plan, nor is it considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of the 'visible drivers' and the 'professors' in utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply 'shortnesses' on the basis of observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) with 10 per cent of the company’s shares from the private sector being given to employees who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 minutes' or the FBI investigation to Kavanaugh may change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week delay and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', Scott Pelley was in contact with the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unfavourable."
However, Graham's voice seems to be walled.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh stands firm and the accusation should contain dynamism," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who was named by her could verify.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday in New York is organized at the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place on stars and a equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people for the Global Citizen Festival will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting here.
Concert participants who want to try a free card for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, a world leader e-mailing, phone calling, or generate awareness in another significant way for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand action or is this just another form of 'clitivism', people feel that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have registered more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters, aimed at a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and declarations on the basis of the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or brought together by sponsorship.
The group estimates that the funds received so far have had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
This group has promised Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after they received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and of Global Citizens, as you can from the social injustice that is undernourished, make a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the many questions asked on the Global Citizens website in which it was asked, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
They said, "It will be a long and difficult path. We will fall into it and fall.
But, like citizens' rights and anti- apartheid movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists that will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may set up the Navy for a 'block' to prevent Russian exports of energy - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington may 'if necessary' take refuge in the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, according to Ryan Zinke, the US Minister of Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinkke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an obstacle to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said, according to the report.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the waterways remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinkke spoke to guests at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit target that presents itself as the 'voice of the energy consumer' in the US.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that they did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that knows only one 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia, a country that offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw its view from the 'unsightly' pipeline Nord Stream 2, which according to Trum van Berlin has made Moscow's 'captive'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only sent for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the idea that energy must not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has triggered a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Federal Association of Deutsche Industries (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power is meeting with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to take part in the presidential elections in 2020, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she 'thoughts about it' to take part in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to recover the damaged government, and this also holds that a woman in the top position," she said according to The Hill's political newspaper.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously about it to make me the president."
Warren ran out against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said that he "sends the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm so upset about what Donald Trump brings into our democracy," she said.
Warren was openly critical of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, an opinion study published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own annex does not consider it to be optional in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of the 'probably' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator was not to be elected, according to an opinion study by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent was for her to be elected.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent prior to a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
He said that he would officially take a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about the PTSS of Track Palin during a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"Because of what my own son has to do, what he's doing now he's back, I understand for other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the audience that was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they're coming back a little differently, they're coming back and they're getting harder, they're coming back and wondering if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the country of their father".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims who are on the run for gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. last Friday, as 'friend-from-het-hof', filed a statement to the Washington court in support of an asylum-seeker who advocated this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union attached in August to federal policy, has not been made known.
She says that her partner "and her violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her, but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace, described by El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are from asylum seekers in the United States, as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has returned a decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals from 2014, which made it possible for immigrants without documents on the run for domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "respects state, federal and international legislation for decades".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is set out in the declaration of the 'friend of the Court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the US damages the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary labour'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion" as such Sessions in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to make every day, everywhere in the world.
Hopeful rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
The situation also worsened for survivors.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while she tried to comfort her short baby in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
A clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched their overnight possessions for valuable things they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overcrowded, unless they are damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the chance of heavy cuts.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the rest of a wall," Haris told an Associated Press correspondent and added to it when he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then I didn't hear anything anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accused China of 'intimacy' with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were highlighted, the US ambassador in China accused the US Ambassador of the use of the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to China's paid annex Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the US Congress elections of 6 November, a charge that China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to cope with the U.S. elections marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed higher import rates.
China's payrolls early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had met US workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," as Branstad wrote in an opinion poll in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government uses freedom of expression and a free press, a long-earned tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find disparate voices and you will not see a true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people have made possible on the difficult economic path, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent news pages refused to publish his article", when he did not say which news page this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans simply excluded women's voters from the interim elections, warned analysts
Now many important Republicans cut themselves around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various charges of sexual violence, warning analysts that this will lead to a relapse, particularly among women, during the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding this subject have been enormous and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to go ahead with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (Republicin, Arizona) to appeal at the last moment for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will not forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and country spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November comes in!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall while the Republicans who have the Justice Commission under control had a choice to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach record heights," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go further, especially among women's women's voters in the suburbs and among young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they disagree with the president."
Even for Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her charge of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a return if the Republics were to press the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican Party, last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote in committee, or the final vote or that Kavanaugh is taking place in court, but it is also the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," explains Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, to the new channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, by which a small majority sign up for the latter.
A new opinion study by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe in the testimony of Ford and 35% believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford stated to the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh was under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her genitals during a party at the time they both studied with Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new internet to access Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to engage with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inruptt, the latest project of the technology sector, is a company based on the open source platform Solid van Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the option to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
"We should do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activities lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be saved.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal power through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and required skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to have a conversation with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that puts all their business models on their heads at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (from Inrupt) is to provide the commercial energy and an ecosystem that protects the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential vote in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will also serve as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Water: Spiritual and Carrier of the Victoria Cross from WO I
The only clergy of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored in its place of birth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, Bernard Vann received the distinction as a result of the attack at Bellengliese and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had been honored by the highest British military.
A memorial stone was revealed by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small zones, Michael Vann, said that it was 'gliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire of field fire and machine guns".
He then stormed through the fire line and led the line forward before he only went to a field-guarded run and turned off three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German shield guard on 4 October 1918, something more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also placed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the strength of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and received Peppa Pig in place
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch a trained Bellator 206 and you won't be able to see the most important moment.
13 matches were mentioned, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the moment that Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald prepared themselves for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were unfavorably surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they had been awake all night especially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"In accordance with the rules of the government, after 6:00 a.m., no content that is not suitable for children should be displayed in the morning, and that is why we had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication with Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Puppa it pig," yess.
Scott Coker, business president of Bellator, said that they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom also get a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the fight back, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the change, many text messages went over and over and believed me, they were not all equally friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen the second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual character
The Olympic janitor Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual character, but that this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 40-year-old said he didn't realize that 'not everyone is like me' until he went on to continue his education.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give other 'hop'.
He also said that the age had contributed to his less value to winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presentation of the long-term show, has been released for a few months due to illness.
Apparently as a link to Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt less than others because it was 'socially not accepted to find both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really exist facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'someone', so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally came after his character.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and has used his presence in the Community Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley married Oscarwinnaar, 20 years older than he was, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're so young, he took part in his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find someone in your own age group who has the same height and low points.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" was changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the cards for London in 2012, because he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the first row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of this all my life. To drown for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musical selection, Proud by Heather Small, who had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and where he still got chicken.
Desert Island Discs is listening to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, at the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to see his form back so as not to make a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who attends the two-year event for the 12th time, was put on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising on the driving range, trying to find out where it is going.
Because even at the top of his career he was never known for his right drivers, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the nearby fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs hanging balls is routinely punished.
And if the job on itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will come in the ninth match on Sunday the ever-accuracy Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newlywed Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who stand behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single games start well, the Mickelson game can be absolutely crucial.
Fury made it clear that he had confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a blow on my back, beat his arm around me and said that he was ready for it tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I would have expected more, but it is what it is and it is the way we have to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely matched the top points of his personal career.
Mickelson has 18 won matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games standing on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain despicable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's fat, he likes to get jokes with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players found it fun to keep him out of trouble last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great progress can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made his debut in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141 1⁄2-131/2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, here, after seeing the lighting of 2018 winning with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, well for a 10-6 advantage on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not yet a game.
Everyone will have to make a full effort tomorrow.
Go to the top and run the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy winning, and that's where we need to keep our focus.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Satisfying about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead in this area.
A new challenge is waiting for tomorrow.
In the morning, the individual performances are coming to an end, and that is a very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner if it's okay, but when you stand alone, your abilities as a golfer are just being tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Fury himself has experience with both sides of this kind on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Mirakel of Medina'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had repressed his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brooklyn, or like in Medina.
When we have the moment, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have agreed our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to guide the opposition and puts Rory McIlroy in front of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany is suspended again
The German Navy's latest fleet should have been in service in 2014, replacing the old warships from the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The establishment of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoted by a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Marine in 2007 should be replaced by the older frgates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of air- and anti-shipcraft rockets and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to insert the latest fregats up to two years apart from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to enable Germany to project power over the sea, have been older than the time they are engaged in, notes that time.
The fatal F125 frigate has already collected the newspaper headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the vessel and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Marine sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it was put into a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship was heavily overweighted, reducing its performance and limiting its ability to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as many as ships of a similar class that were used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the entire project, including crew training, becomes a problem.
It is said that this has reached a thousand-dollar €3.1 billion, compared with the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frogs have in their grip are extremely important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, acknowledged that the Marine actually has "a shortage of usable ships".
The official said that the problem of the time as a snowball had grown, because old ships had been taken from the company but no replacement vessels had been delivered.
He complained that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of pets
New research carried out on an agricultural product in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how to use petal mice from the countryside in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the usual and small drug fly, the brown large fly and the water fly at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed on key locations around the land to monitor the activities of the bats through the season.
NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the mouse's claws and what kind of action is being taken.
Then a map of the habitat and a report is produced to make such a detailed picture on the landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results show which areas of the habitat are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the making of pastures and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Flying mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and eyebrows can also pose a risk, as can flyers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
Their nightly hunting habits, however, make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight size.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, carry out sleep inspection and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reservation for pets in Scotland at the Thrave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of pets of Scotland live.
Landscape Manager David Thompson says that the land is the ideal territory for pets.
"Here in Thrave we have a great environment for pet mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much information about pets yet and therefore the work that we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to do."
It stresses the importance of monitoring poultry before maintenance activities are carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping area can lead to the death of 400 female poultry and their young, which may eliminate a whole local population.
Flying mice are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall or destroy them or to destroy their sleeping quarters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to provide a contribution to help.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats and many of our species we just don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accused of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to appeal to the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the charges have been published.
The peaks of Portugal and Juventus are accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375.000 to be silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live named Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were reported, reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Ballen on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be named by calling my name, but that's part of the store.
I'm a happy man, and through and through," the footballer added to this, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare a case in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges they called 'an irreplaceable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where, according to the accusation, he raped her, as is to be read in the prosecution filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but that he was sometimes left in the trap that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were photos of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an extrajudicial arrangement because she was 'fear for the consequences' and because she was concerned about 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says she wants to invalidate the scheme because she is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go to Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer he went to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' as auto producers
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in the field of auto production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'stupid' that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that, as Britain, the EU would leave without a deal, the company would temporarily put production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese auto producer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of 'no-deal Brexit' jobs would be costly.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that as Britain crashed from the EU at the end of March, we will see the production in our factory stillfalls," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also revealed their fears about the consequences of a departure from the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about the risks in delivery chains in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The production line of Toyota is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37 minutes parts of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there can be an alarm at the boundaries that can lead to delays and cuts in parts according to industry.
Toyota cannot save more than one day in stock at the factory in Derbyshire, so the company was informed, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU 'exactly agreed to avoid those border checks'.
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 today's program.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to go through with this very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that the additional costs would affect the competitive position of the company and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the United trade union at the factory, said that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs have been lost, they will never come back again.
One government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting with Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed once a week, while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia's assistants and possible obstruction of the presidential process.
The question whether Trump is going to dismiss the deputy prosecutor-general and thereby endangers Mueller's independence, the Washington wheel machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of having a microphone to establish talks with Trump and to dismiss the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, they shouted the round that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to disband Rosenstein rather than, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the boss of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set for this week, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for a week, given all the other things that are under way with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters have been struggling with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scariest of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'watching' TV journalists, however, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more questions and answers than any president for him," she said, without giving proof of this: "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely much better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do a lot and you've seen us do that often in the last few weeks, and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the President are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated possible why, he made an open and sometimes bizarre appearance for the reporters collected.
Minister of Health writes a letter about Brexit to employees of NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue working with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has been determined to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continue, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also collected preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be an uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve NHS' activities and offer benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fast and sure you're home, and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after headache
The line baker of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, suffered an emergency yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident was short for rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there a little bit or more," said Reed.
The coaches and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'no details are yet known about the type/range of the injury' and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in its first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was taken on Saturday in total five times before leaving the field, so he was taken 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralize the success of Corbyn to attract young voters
The increase in the fees shall be levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to be £ 120 million per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable houses and to tell them about multiple-debts.
The increase in the fees shall be levied on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being incurred in an attempt by the government to combat rooflessness.
The premium, which comes above the current leases, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £ 120 million per year in this way.
According to estimates, 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, and this makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the housekeeper.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson had begged for a reduction in the law to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping their prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to set off quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'housing damage' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to the exhibition 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the British Dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple as it is for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here if it is for hard-working British citizens.
For too many people the dream of ever having a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head has become too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is managing Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his 'ultimate ambition' to ever become Scotland's manager.
The Shot, 42, enjoys the challenge of restoring the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in third place in League One, on three points of the first place.
He went to the Stage of Light last summer after returning the last season of St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my father's country.
But I was selected for the B team and thus the course was off," Ross told Sportssound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, I saw my father Scotland often playing in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps attracting me.
However, that possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to be the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently being measured by 'can I let this club go back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it must be in the Premier League," he says.
"It is not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years old in his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a cross-point," he recalled when he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did the best I could, I earned quite well, and I knew a few reasonable points.
But football can be tough.
There's a lot of things you're facing weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The heat wave in the summer has increased revenue from British pubs who are struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover rising by 2.7 per cent in July, but income in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's business advisory agency, who collected the figures, said: "In the long run, and the fact that England has been participating in the world championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had turnoverd 2.8 percent more, with the difference that the restaurants were getting even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at selling drinks paid off the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than those restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also directed to the sale of food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It looks like people just went out for a drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the drinking rate was 6.6% higher for the month, while the food market was 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, an analyst for the leisure and hospitality sector, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for the trade in the output market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a turnover of 4.8 per cent year-on-year is particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a bad time for the food operators, and only the time will learn if the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary resistance."
The total turnover growth in the public and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the public, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One of the five children has a secret social media account that they keep hidden for their parents
One of the five children, only under 11 years of age, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden for parents and teachers, reveals an investigation
Survey among 20,000 secondary school students revealed growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say to have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One of the five children, some not over 11 years of age, makes social media accounts they keep hidden for adults.
An investigation among 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came to justice on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to 'verse' her.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools revealed that 40% of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them had personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Elid Doyle becomes the 'vote of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Elid Doyle is elected to the Scottish Sports Council, as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports drivers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilith enjoys great respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and 400 meters during the 1996 games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "This month I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that it would only take time to learn if I would recover and to what extent.
It has been awfully hard work, but I am now completely restored, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!"
An ad for breast pump where mothers are compared with cows, divided online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an ad that compares seeking mothers to cows that are milled.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, a consumer technology producer, has issued an ironic, inspired advertisement on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to collapsing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hood full of song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't watch it, these are not eyes, these are my breasts'.
The refresher then pursues with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the baby's, pumps, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's.
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has directly ensured an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has released hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the 'horror' of the dairy industry is being compared.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected and ordered to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after the order" is written in a response.
The breast pump of Elvie fits discreetly in a foodbeha (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted, "Of course, this is traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd buy it if I was still breast-feeding.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, focused on moms who are colves (often at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they're just 'coys'.
This ad does not appear at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their behaes.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are collapsing sometimes feel just cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly in a feeding bay, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on reels.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says about this: "The Elvie Pump is a dermaté revolutionary product which earned a bold and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between collapsing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to place the collagen and the associated challenges in the snowflakes and at the same time show in a supportive and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has reached a peak, although the number of monthly cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to risk their own chances of staying in the country by registering for a child.
This risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should print their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered as sponsor for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80% of sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
We're pursuing these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the treatment of children, officials introduced new rules, forcing some of them to appear before the court within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the employees at the station, within one month of the start of the detention.
Many of them will be through a videoconferencing for the court, instead of in person, to plead their application for a legal status for an immigration right.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay in custody, the greater the chance that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to the workers at the locker and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for it or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them still struggle with.
Syria urges the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem has also called on the Syrian refugees to return, even now the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moulem, who is also a vice-premier, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, in the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the House.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this holy war until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly involved in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country affected by war.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were favourable for their return and he intended 'to spread irrational fears in some Western countries', which left most of the refugees homeless.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are policing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is concluded.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major roundabout of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has led to a large-scale attack from the Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moulem stressed, however, that this agreement knew 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front connected to Al-Qaeda, who would be 'cut off'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN MEP, hopes soon to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government members and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and open the way for elections.
Moulem made it clear what the conditions for the Syrian Government to take part in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump would win the election in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is temporarily terminated by a set-off procedure and scandals.
In what, of course, would be 'the most dramatic end of a presidency ever'.
At this point, however, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, viewers have been more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC during the 'prime-time' period.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers at night with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why?
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's going to be more than a well-informed citizen, when you're watching for six hours you're looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which it's about the Jack of Paul Manafort's pauper who cost $15,000 (a piece of clothing full of pride) according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
I'll never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's about a reality show is partly that he stops you from something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating distribution of the Trump show and the daily plots (one fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was looking into MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Court of Justice at stake.
"I remember that we did all those weird shows, not so long ago, and that people said 'that's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flow of money, thanks to a redistribution of a electoral district, which requires two people's representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently re-distributed district of Pittsburgh meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special spring.
Lamb must record it against another people's representative, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is familiar with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January found that the old districts were not legally classified ('gerrymangering') in favour of the Republics.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout in the field of campaign funding between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a neptune victory in a well-known special election for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have little benefit.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China and rejected it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States have decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognise Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the Prime Minister of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from leaving the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials knew that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence is giving a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for half October, as a sign of the government's importance for the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further withdrawal, without any hard messages about Washington's criminal measures.
A spokesperson for the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next step can be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-action of justice by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller's research is likely to also focus on co-existence between the Trump and Russia campaign in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changes color, Trump must be responsible for that institute, just as he is preparing to address the electors again, and perhaps he should be responsible for a jury in a court of law.
That is a hope for me, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable or that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938 German officials were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czecho-Slovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and therefore missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
This speeds up or slows down the course of history around such bending points and the inevitable threats of democracy.
Americans are currently confronted with various of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump is released by Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this paper reported that, over the past year, he had suggested to speak to the President in secret and that he had speculated about the President's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the report of The Times is not correct.
"How will we react if the new investigation requested by the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if it is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible charges of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call for Trump to be responsible?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I don't think we're going to miss the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever owned my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, away to add candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a washing was depicted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers get Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Because of a kneeblessure, the midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game from the season until the 2-2 match at Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a jumping board to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal really has a good eleventh," said the 31st.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but over the entire game, an equal game is probably an honest result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the best team.
The next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the public is behind us, I'm sure we can print through and we can get a positive result.
Last year was certainly hard, of all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a feeling-factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully, we can now pass through, let the last season behind us and be successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the respondents in the survey had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10% said that they had talked to their children about this.
"People like to see a family member take care of them, but they don't need to take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not wish to make your wishes known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor in the arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or to invest your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal battle when insurance is to be used.
Take care of a health care authority so that you can identify a trusted person who can ignore your medical care and make sure that professionals stick to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider, too, a power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make your financial decisions on behalf of you and to ensure that the invoices are paid if you cannot do this yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies in that case?
Place these details in a written plan so you can have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
Fired several times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a gun when he walked home after an evening.
The victim, 40 plus, was in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was touched in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents describe the charge, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'willing act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the expectation is that the killing will continue.
By disabling the means of communication, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala Regent, an area north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the movement with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Midden-Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was the fourth 40th anniversary of the tsunami.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwestern Celebes.
The regent, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Mid-Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dongalla have regularly been hit by tsunamis in the last hundred years by the Agency for the Fighting of the Indonesian Disasters.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck west of Dongala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December provided a tsunami that struck 14 countries and required a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 on the scale of Richter took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake on the scale of Richter met the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude of 7.5 on the scale of Richter met one of the Mentawai islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: An in-depth earthquake struck Pidie's regency in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as the people were reminded of the destructions of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found death by falling buildings.
2018: More earthquakes occur in the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made sure that thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and the candidate for the vice-president, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and the provision of opposition during the trial, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman-in-law tried to call the police to report the alleged arrests, he dropped her phone.
Palin is held in custody at the Mat-Su conservation house with a guarantee of $500, reported by KTUU.
He appeared to the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, certainly knowing' when he was asked for this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three violations of Class A, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B violation, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now before the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon of influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by a veteran group in 2016 after she had linked the violent behavior of her son to PTSS, that he would have left his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunamis: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter has led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks are off, while the expectation is that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the centre of Celebes, which lies to the northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he was already on his way by foot and bicycles in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Siepov 'votely' killed the eight victims and 'votely' has caused serious physical injuries, according to the declaration of intent in which the death penalty is required, which has been submitted to the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the prosecution with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described the way in which Siepov carried out the attack as 'cruel, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitsj Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that a case was brought before the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they had been sentenced to spying on the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed both by means of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not give evidence of harassment in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He let the investigator know he felt good about his action, she's the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, the police told him.
He did not claim to be guilty of charge with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Siepov, said that he was "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a debt confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The defense of Siepov had already asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Preservative Member of Parliament says that NIGEL FARAGE should guide the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilize a folk army during a protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the 'hot' of Eurosceptici, while one of Theresa May's own Members proposed to guide him in the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the March in Birmingham that the UK 'would already be out' as Mr. Farage Brexit was.
However, the challenge that may be faced with the reconciliation of the heavily divided leaders is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister fights to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while attacking by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Co-workers were confident that they would continue and try to close a deal with Brussels despite the obstacles, thus forcing Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers in the pullenman'.
He suggested that Farage should be addressed and responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he'd done the job, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Members of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the lunatic."
In explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that the public opinion has been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely irrelevant."
The conservative Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the large public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure that we are elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a message addressed to May, she added: "First keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'hot' if they betrayed the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not letting you get out of here with'."
In a message to the most enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put on fire our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has given us the victory at the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this March with a meeting of two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists swam with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after setting up this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, member of the Labour High House, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative party at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide for IT systems and for all technology for Canada plus, for the free limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans 'to think good' about presidential candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she 'will think well of her candidate for the presidency' after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican member of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been the midpoint of speculation that it would be possible to engage in the fight with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A visitor asked her if she would be willing to vote for the presidency.
Warren answers that it's time for women to go to Washington to recover our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after shooting by Wayde Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00.
They gave a video free of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who is seen in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot down and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and was killed as a result," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot down by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has known to have been present at the crime scene, in possession of a gun and have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98-metre junior player who was raised in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him the victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and almost left Hamilton in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the chest and left Hamilton in the dusty rides in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came back on his head after a wheel-on-wheel action that forced the Ferrari driver to release space from the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Fartopen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long leader of the race, because he stayed at his band selection and swirled on fast finish, so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round, he went to the chest, to which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became the fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and let me through.
The team did its best for the places one and two" said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday election meeting on the fact that she was not fully the source of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not have the testimony given directly by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he showed that what was happening in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unworthy and unworthy'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and rude and rude," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it.'
You still know that?
Diane Feinstein, did you have a drink?
You still know her answer... you've leaked the document-- 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't die.'
Well, wait a minute.
If we've been dead... no, we've not been dead," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter stating the charges to the address of Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was leaking.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go in confidence, and I treated it in confidence, as she had asked."
But the president failed to believe her denial, and he commented on it at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that was not a good body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the President suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power, with all the necessary means.
You see the community, the indignity, they don't give anything to who they're hurting, who they're going to have to take the power and get the control back" the president would have said according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had taken the lead with two goals by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along the way, before Dwyer de Giants took the lead again.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen with two goals sure to win.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a stand on Friday night to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assistant from Kendall McFaul. David Rutherford gave the assistant with whom Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
During a press opening period Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the proposition for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants had the first rest in advance, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them back to a level with a power-play ball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He took care of the win with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller dies while he makes sure hundreds of people can escape the earthquake on a plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after his death because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could ascend safely on board.
More than 800 people are killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
The area is still hit by powerful shocks, and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild to- and-to-be moving traffic routes of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then ready, could rise safely on the runway.
Then he broke out of the traffic jams, when he thought it was coming down.
He died in the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirat, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter scheduled for Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it" he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths may rise to the thousands, and the Agency for Disaster Control in the country is aware that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"But it assumes that the mortality rate is still rising because many bodies are under the dirt and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive burial site will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are introduced by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are plundered all over the world."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is developed in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo from Indonesia arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the military present: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?" reported CNN.
earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that was crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that another man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the congested plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger will be missed on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had reached water during landing at the Chukeland airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events remains unexplained for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and the runway has missed.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told us that he himself and some others managed to walk through the water, which came to their centre, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewards were panicked and screamed and that he had no serious headache.
The U.S. Navy announced that seabirds who were in the vicinity of work also helped in rescue operations by bringing people to the coast with a breathable boat, before the plane sinks further in about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last twenty years 111 people have died in crashes of aircraft companies registered with the PNG, but that does not apply to Air Niugini.
Analyst sets the timeline of the night a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his requirement on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave a testimony for a few hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone records to determine the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she left life.
Rowlett told that he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and told me he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him he was in his truck at Sanford that night, Sanford said he was 'slaughed because my truck was in Nashville'.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told us that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The cell phone data indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew some time after the death of Chambers the texts, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her from his life," Hale said.
The defense begins Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to begin the day after the discussions.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hippop'?
A hipoptrio wants to put the negative image of the genre into discussion by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol suggest that hippopus is alienated from the origin of political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the root and make 'conscious hippop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently had another experience in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York New Year's wife gives a couple to the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York girl married a married couple because of dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrong-sent text in which the mother had the complaint about 'the weather of such blackness'.
The couple refuses to be racist and calls the case 'dispression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her disillusionment when she discovered that the new girl, Giselle Maurice, appeared to be a Negroid woman when she met her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEEE WERE ZO'N ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, who felt 'uneasy', turned out to be Ms. Maurice when she realized her blindness, stating that her previous teenage wife, who was African-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino woman.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by a taxi.
Now Maurice is taking the couple to court to get compensation for $350,-- per day for the 6 months she was hired to stay indoors with the family, or without contract.
'I want them to feel that you're not doing anything like this,' said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The married couple abstained from claiming that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after they were afraid that by insulting her they could no longer trust her.
My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists', partner Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here.
Regarding the case compared with 'pressing', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
Would you follow someone like that?
That's not so nice, the investment banker added it.
While the case is still under way, the public opinion is quickly contributing to the capitalisation of the couple on social media, where it is highlighted for their behaviour and reasoning.
The editors of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, revealed a newly discovered letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even for the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it is very pleasant.'
She told her father that, before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, when the cameraman worked with the British broadcaster BBC, he was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt bitter after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was homely proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lively for him, it almost seemed like a child's performance; you're proud when you did nothing for it yourself.
I think he was about to experience the success of Paddington.
While Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he made the bear himself for success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her over the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors were in vain trying to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not get it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
'Then Nad's phone came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping, slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process turned things out further.
I could only sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't complain, scream, or cry, because I was in the middle of a lot of people and families.
I really had to keep myself big."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, stepped into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what test she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
'I sat down with my head down and the tears remained coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Ruining women put messages on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide are strong enough to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are picking up inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney in the English county Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef with an attractive grin.
He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit up every room.
Yet he already stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of his life.
Mrs Davis said, 'I constantly worry about a chain reaction.'
Mrs. Davis has made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk, even if it's just a friend.
Don't be silent. Talk about it.'
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her 15-year partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt dark or depressed or something," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He sat all the way to the ground on First Christmas - when the children took out their presents he didn't look at them at all or so."
She said that his death was a great trauma to her, but that she had to deal with it: "It broke the whole family apart.
It'll tell us.
But we must all go on and continue to fight.'

Brett Kavanaughs' future is uncertain while the FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he is asking for, a study limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity again,' said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'out of each other', in the middle of a firmly anchored postage within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct a study?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been held for over five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as the Republicans are expected to do, their efforts to get their husband elected in the highest court in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus his wife Ashley, who the Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished the report?
There will then be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 republics and 49 democracies.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to deliver the ruling vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of passersby in North Korea 'remove' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-and seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sought, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Single Warding, explains that there were 1,127 overruns last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park states that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smugglers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of North Korean runners are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the passersby to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often exposes them to violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, which discussed in particular the stagnant negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed in broad lines to work on the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the US, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament', said Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I could not help thinking that if a woman were to behave like this, she would be called 'hysterical'', Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very excited; he sometimes screamed almost and was especially from the area when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him 'grotic and coordinated murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
'I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and by the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats,' said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to set up an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were to be appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'That's what I can say about it: if he does not tell the truth at Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he now serves,' said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Court (usually abbreviation D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democrat that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law on affordable health) and that Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh raised questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand merry when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed in the Supreme Court', that is Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a just trial of months and years of intense anger that passes, and they can only cry to get it out.
"We'll cry if we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later to me.
'I don't think that's funny, do you?'
She went on to say: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge of something and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry. She developed a method that always when she was angry, she was crying. She said to the one she spoke to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried.
I just thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partly permitted as an expression of anger, because tears are essentially not understood.
One of my best remembered memories from a previous job, in a man-dominated office, was when I had to cry awfully because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a guy who was a little scared of everyone, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you on the box.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was engaged in an extraordinary affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'cattenkwaad' or 'apentraken') and withdrew from the race, Mrs Schroeder, deeply disappointed that there was no reason why she would not apply herself.
'It wasn't a well-considered decision,' she told me 30 years later laughing.
'There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about Snow White and the Seven Horses.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fund-raising, and so she didn't promise to join if she couldn't make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
'Maybe they think I'm getting a discount?' she asked herself.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she was in trouble.
'I would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,' recalled Mrs Schroeder.
'They'll have thought that Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my gravestone?
"They cry?"
How the trade war between the US and China can extract for Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming, and although the war has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries could be drawn up by experts in the long term for Beijing.
earlier this year, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from the US from China.
Beijing has taken reparations every time in nature, most recently by increasing prices from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in American goods.
China has promised to equalize the U.S. every time, and the worlds on a post-largest economy will probably not quickly cut their eyes.
To let Washington bend, requests must be granted, but publicly bending for the US is too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is playing the smart, the trade war with the US, China could be positive in the longer term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could bring one of the two countries into a free economic fall is indeed much more dangerous than viewers have previously recognized,' said Abigail Grace, a research associate of the Center for a New American Security, a thought specialized in national security issues addressing Asia.
Syria 'clear' to allow refugees to return, thus Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, said that conditions in his country would improve.
"Today, the situation is more stable and safer on the ground, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the ground.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they have to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' in southwestern Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn's team received the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost all the tournament fighting, left his long battle in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, skimmed in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever got 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-ranking player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanjaard Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
'I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the fable to his countrymate, John Ram, who went to defeat the American legendary Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
'The huge pride I feel because I've reported Tiger Woods, and I followed that guy all the time when I grew up,' said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level during the entire tournament.
The American leader, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: 'I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
Soon this morning, we have made Europe a bit more difficult.
We're offering the opposite.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed.'
Rode gloed update: Concentrations take off in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline in Red ice concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay Area (based on the west coast of Florida in the United States).
According to the Committee, there is a report on the fragmentary increase in red light in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red light extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to the southern Lee county.
There are about 16 km to the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
Red light was also seen in Pasco County.
Average concentrations have been reported for the coast of Pinellas County in the last week, low to high concentrations for the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or off Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or off Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are reports of irritation of the airways in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the northwest of Florida, no report was made of airway irritation in the last week.
