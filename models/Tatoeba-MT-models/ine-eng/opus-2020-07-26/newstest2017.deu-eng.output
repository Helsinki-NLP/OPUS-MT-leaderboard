28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center.
The brother of the victim said that he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm him, "It finally went up with him again."
The Leichnam found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the judicial medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had celebrated his dream job six months ago as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
One speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and affections are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia reported that Frank first lived in hostels, but that, "the things for him finally went up."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
His kind of connection with his family was always to cook something to prepare us for dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything that's going on in the world, he was this unscrupulous diamond that lit up every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD message phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'll always be stuck in sheets
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview now unmistakably.
"I will always be stuck in sheets or be glued from outside the label, which most of the time has nothing to do with me and the reality."
"I don't want to be perfect and successful myself."
"I'm being honest with you, these things are a little bit tighter."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
Mostly, the actress spends her time at home, before television with a laxative and Mexican food, it's called in the magazine.
To the white light, she brings the question of the wish for children: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are observable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, sought a little change with an exit on the beach.
For the 58 years it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Goldene Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday night, they chased home in the fast gallop to the pastures.
A kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And that's how the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournaments - again near horses.
He and his family were guided by the AALRV system, and on a horse he did not even venture for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sport aid gave the man from the homes of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.
At awards there is no lack of a sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstreuz, Silbernes Lorbaerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has named him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will not only be granted for sports success, but also for social engagement".
For decades Langer has been promoting growth.
And so he continued to pay the price of 25,000 euros at the same time.
With 15 more outstanding athletes, the double US master winner was taken to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fetter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Faher Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoca Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Schockemölle and the posthum of the handballer Erhard Marvellich.
Many of these athletes came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza prize was held.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance to the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.
The two US presidential candidates, however, are once again involved in tax and energy policy as well as in a matter of principle.
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamentally philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns how the state of the economy can damage them - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
On the other hand, he would be quite different, alleged Trump.
He will withdraw regulations massively, and he will make himself a large-scale tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.
Clinton says, however, that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has unavoidable opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That's why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say they're almost worth it.
The democratic candidate has announced the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the Republican State-critical Teaparty refugees.
So we could have some internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-establish coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in protected areas, which the Paris Convention on Climate Protection wants to announce.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand with its investment programme the renewable energies and asks: "A country will be the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It'll be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements - the two competitors are not far from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, the US does not want to isolate itself from international trade - but just to protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be better paid, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars was a hunger wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: Once he says: the minimum wage must be lifted, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months should rather be developed in terms of the fiscal policy of the two camps.
On one side lies Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to curve the growth.
His critics insist on him to make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution.
Flight: "Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is at least a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously in the room with large eyes.
His mother looks at the table.
Until she notices she's being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the district manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the München North in one of the few decentralized accommodation for isolated women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her escape," Bahr says.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them as hope bearers to Europe," she says.
In women, there are other reasons for escape: "Many steal from it secretly because they do not see another way out."
In their home, they have had experience of sexual violence, forced labour, murder, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
It's on the run.
"For example, the sneaker asking for a bottle of water for sexual action is not rare," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who thinks it's over, as soon as they get to Germany, is wrong, says Bahr.
Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be viewed as inferior and abused at least.
This means that about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in Munich north are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily."
Many women are so used to it that they don't say anything.
"Or they don't trust to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often didn't know how to help, it only needs more accommodation for them, called for Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
To the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some answer with no.
There is, for example, no such thing in the state's premises.
Even in Schwaben, refugee women are not kept separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press speaker.
In Oberbayern, sub- and medium-sized sectors, there are in some community-run floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lowerbayern, there are two central accommodation only for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be subjected separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If the privacy is lacking or men and women are brought together, violence against women may occur - in the long run."
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is included in the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be seen at the Andrang, which is on the house in Munich.
"Since he has talked about us, we have a long waiting list," said Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Barriers to assistance: Demands for new work-related measures
Representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their trade unions to approve new measures to combat their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it had failed to address the concerns of the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "absolutely calm" to problems, leading to the rejection of the treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to reject the proposed new treaty completely and has called for official renegotiation to all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating action, starting in September.
The disputes led to assistants fighting six times this year, the first total losses in the history of the NHS.
BMA’s assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malavana withdrew after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were still held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract should be beneficial and acceptable.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be mandatory.
Russia and Turkey: "A Alliance of External Sides"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month ongoing war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handcuff, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow and he barely radiated heat, even for his restraints.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have known as if something bad had never happened.
I thought his enthusiasm would be the opposite.
But one of Putin's sustainable coolers showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the removal of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction to the time was burned out.
Putin reported out and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.
The sin was even greater, as it was taken by an alleged friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild the veto if it is not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the government-controlled media launched a strong, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Once it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything.
At the very least, the charges of leading officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's been fighting a lot.
But in St.Petersburg the official message said it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs, first of all, all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office at a failed state strike last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also scared him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, travel organisers and charter companies will be made easier when the flights are retaken.
They count on a late-sea wave to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the west, as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
To this end, the constant fluctuation over the current pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is intended to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relation to the West.
The Russian head of state in Ankara has certainly won a bonus for requesting support for the elected state bodies after the attempted state line.
This is well-known for Moscow's self-understanding, which itself has a profound fear of changing regimes.
The summit meeting in this beautiful palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described to me, "Align of External Sides": two countries that feel broken and treated badly from the west and now unite.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of first talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not even addressed the subject.
The President of Turkey refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey launches the Russian combat - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak again at least.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is intended to be reduced only to a back office role, according to the Bank's Board of Directors.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the Bank has distanced itself when it had to be almost collaborated and saved eight years ago.
At this time, brand strategies have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial markets.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds on sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Victory Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands into focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the central headquarters and the stock exchange will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that are more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will be our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sport sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th Newmarket Award at Predication
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th gains
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winning on Newmarket on Friday.
He put on the predication, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm light and very modest.
Dettori captures the jubilee when he holds the victory on predication
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, who had nine Derbysiers 4,493 careers
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intelligence that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been fanning for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and a big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismont
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismonuts, Frankie Dettori has been the hangman of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorichen Seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had problems at first when he returned from his six-month suspension, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to overcome his doubts and return to his best form.
And he's not long before the end - Dettori once said he wants to continue in competitions until his 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's narrowest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin it is said that Putin has arranged "the discharge of Ivanov's duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without any reason".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website it is said (in Russian) that he was later chief of protocol and chief of government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that it is the Government's main task to support your work as head of state in relation to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convinced?
This step has made Moscow a secret environment.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time and works like him for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that the chief of staff would return to his own wishes.
But despite the smile on the cameras, there are only a few of them that are convinced - especially now, just before Parliament's elections.
So here is the consequences of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead the Russian environmental policy at one time - came to great skepsis.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust these very complicated posts - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the posts in December 2011.
Former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
As Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people, most of whom he trusted.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of office would have violated Putin's Constitution.
But these posts were taken by another close allies of Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized to the public on Thursday before announcing his termination.
In the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how the character Gibsons from the series followed by a team of FBI agents are published, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, are expected to be published at a later date.
The 54-year-old who had previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg was with him since the first staff of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've stuck my whole heart blood for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a message published on Friday.
I had hoped to be at the end of it, but it will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned radiation of the 12th staff is set on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish that landed in gardens in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish, which appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be the sandals that were fired from a spring well.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone might throw something light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "dark bludgeon", which closes to the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 wires.
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown made a visit today and was one of the first to go from country to country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viaduct and the Bridge Cover is a great activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents a future-looking construction of high and low.
After the installation of the last section of the road end and its connection to the north tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gaps on the north side or the country side.
This was achieved by drawing the north bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very hot activity.
Massive, since the route is 222 meters long, approximately 6,000 tons weighs and had to be pulled up by a rise of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny - on each side they saw only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in the Moelfre Bay: Three Men Have "Happy to Be Still in Life"
Three men are "happy to be still alive", after being thrown by their fishing boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST Alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on from its own strength.
"We saw how the boat in its vicinity turned around and presented us the worst," said the manager of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already weighed the boat beyond their reach until we leave it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a boje without rescue.
They all came on board the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have been unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop, but it left the person who controlled the boat in the center of the boat.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Severely injured - man stands on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to his apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholics cut off his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she got into the apartment, he got in on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by hand and body.
The police could catch the killer.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister after that.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-olds wanted to calm down their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
So she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street they met the ex-life companion of the man.
When the two women reentered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-friend.
Who's building cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens mean that investors will be given much more responsibility in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that in the next few years, Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 cheap apartments?
The SPD proposes for the next Council meeting a "dwelling concept".
But the dispute is programmed.
First of all, it is the question: Who is really going to build the cheap apartments?
There's been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD fraction president Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: Anyone who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the favourable apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, the big argument in the courthouse was, as Bratmann says, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas, but at least 20 per cent of the apartments as social apartments."
A new urban housing promotion programme, which will cost millions and still have to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.
The link still wants tough orders for investors.
Despite what Bratmann says, there is an increase in the situation on the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, additional tasks in the construction management will be provided.
More personnel are needed.
It's unclear if we're going to get the experts.
However, the program is still not complete: because about 1260 new apartments should be built without it.
How, though, does the loss of more than 1300 favourable apartments, whose promotion will take place in the next few years?
By 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning political speaker Nicole Palm should now be bought from the city.
In addition, it was necessary to consider bringing apartments back to the price bond.
It's possible in the West City.
At one stroke, the problem was solved.
Because in the West City, the deadlines are coming to an end.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price bond for cheap apartments.
Only: That's what the owners don't want.
Since the number of social apartments in the West City is increasing dramatically again, it is far from the aim of the so-called intermix.
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the debate.
Group president Holger Herlitschke says: "For a large majority, the CDU must go to the boat."
They have concentrated on more construction sites for single families.
But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet.
Pokémon Go, a Hunting for Health and Happiness That Rewards
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time with it, staring at screens, has been blamed by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go it's about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on TV, then on video games and lastly limited on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (there were later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat at the beginning of July.
The market introduction in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the server.
Within less days, Pokémon Go had more users than teenagers and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (through a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when it was younger, joined the whale and ran for the search for the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the start of the game, the number of people who train 30 minutes each day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to bring to it "take 30 minutes of time," "from the sofa to come" and "to be active every day" are on deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look sad.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of getting sick of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to bring them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also dark game destroyers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game.
The new one will be lost and the use will be left with time.
However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active value in the real world and help many people to be active, fitter and healthier in the hunt.

Simone Biles creates gold in the dammenten
Forget the press.
Forget the hippie.
Simone Billes is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the spring horse.
Don't bother on the bar.
Attractive on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now finally also the Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament turned into a multi-combat title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the lights of the Olympic Games.
Its total score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the Silver Medal winner and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles turns on the pool during the single-marriage finale of the women in the art tournament at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-combat title and totals the fifth, while holding her name to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Billes has dominated her sports for the last three years, 15 world championships - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of pride and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton of her said she was "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Billes and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, back to Texas, would be seen as a disappointment.
The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugged each other after winning gold and silver in the single-marriage finals of women in the art tournament at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exhumation sign at the retreating event of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Billes was on it, during her long journey to the top, never to have planned the future, that is not true.
Part of her ground exercises - which include her typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music, which would fit home on the street outside the Olympiarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a child and was discovered by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament, trained in the Boorman, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-competition competition since summer 2013, a series that will last as long as Billes wants.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture weighed down.
Swivel bars and ground towers - in which Billes holds the world's title.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the swivel bar and set up another one on the ground with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently when she expected her final performance - a pure formality - and tears flowed to Billes brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a racket for the last four years when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went into a teebrake at Mustafina.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, named by the Americans "Oma", had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As for Billes, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a brand new meaning:
Police: 3 victims killed in serial murder while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder for a decade while they were sitting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis Daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The bomber fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the side of the car and running away with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not include the pockets or $2,900, which were owned by one of the adults.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investigator to become a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people were killed in Spanish residents within four months in nine attacks and two others were injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is expected to be the work of the serial killer.
The investigators found cartridge holes and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microzephalie: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Microzephalie, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, it was my first thought, I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for that.
What's not at all right -- of course you've been allowed to do that," she said.
Your husband Vincent and you have been told that Edmund will never be able to recognize her under circumstances and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know that people were still doing,' said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walker.
Edmund was not able to sit or scratch until his third year of life, and he can't always talk.
But he's making slow progress.
He can run with support and cycling.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund intended for "please sing something for me"."
"We bring him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as masts or zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is too early to tell how it will affect the life of those infected with zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect her to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth injuries caused by the zikavirus.
It'll be better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding causes rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is calculated throughout Saturday with more rainfalls.
Numerous rivers in Southeast Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards told us that government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that they are already on the way to help the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, shared that the demands for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoea had required tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over wide parts in southern Louisianas until Saturday.
The Weather Service indicated that additional 3 to 5 duties could fall on rain in this area.
In southern Alabama, a early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The river Committee near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will reach any probability after the weekend record level.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could swim many houses in the area near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a current-driven flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as they will flow slowly through the affected rivers only in Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams were still humming people from the river water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose significantly over the night.
He said that another stepfather who lived nearby would have warned him.
"We are awake and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my size.
His wife said that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a height of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the obstacles and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency aid had saved all three of them in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire department in Gloster, where they were placed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flooding had "extensively spread" as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported close to Livingstone from midnight until Friday morning of 13,75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been very thorough since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfalls and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoea Parish and educational failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a commandant in Tangipahoea 200 floating houses reported.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by the high water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoea, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the high water and sandbags were provided for the inhabitants to take, hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last big flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his statements, a handful of houses on Thursday were to be reported as overfishing, but on Friday they were not reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Shitted by Balls", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week the second time that a 6-year-old child will be shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several gun injuries, including in the country, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious of his transportation to the hospital.
"He has done a lot, his little body has been pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores reported to the sender.
I just can't believe it.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the messenger that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are according to CBS Philadelphia in stable condition.
The boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police found out if they could be under one of the injured men of the perpetrators.
The investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a crossfire between several shields.
Pattern holes for storms that were traced back to different storms passed over the tatort.
It seems that this has clearly been an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the road, there were caves.
This seems to have been the case here with several armed fighters who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia told the sender.
Several houses and vehicles were also met in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossblade on her arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
She's resting and the police are looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the Women's Olympia team in the tower and for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I have been at every summer Olympics and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which have inspired many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is a Jew and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has confirmed the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number was one among the women's tournaments as an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and American cheerleader.
Now the world was able to be witnesses of the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were not expecting, but were delivering masterly gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman, who won an individual multi-combat event for women gold.
Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.
We experience the tops of this kind of sport, but that's not how tournaments across the country don't look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all joined the same route as Aly and Madison to create it for the Olympic team.
You are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team. Also, the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality seems to be that Turnen is a expensive sport and Turner in the first place in private tournaments that are maintained by parents for training, institution, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their tournaments and families). The list can be continued whenever possible.
The majority of these tournaments are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.
In these associations the tournaments receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to provide the communities with countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and more accessible tournament training.
I've founded my 20-year-old tournament.
At my events we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide the youth with high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls to take an interest in the tournament and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the gathering of Olympic team gold and thanks to the fact that she is motivated by so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors would like to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to enforce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "Niemandsland" and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistants are expected to receive a new contract containing changes to night and week work in order to improve the maintenance of ungast times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistive Doctors last night, said in a statement: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will exacerbate the current staff crisis and reduce it to treat all doctors fairly."
In just eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks have been made by the government to participate in protests and sometimes in deafening silence.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act to lift the suction and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not do so, it has made it clear to the assistant doctors that they are ready to take further action to combat this disease.
The last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and doctors were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain.
The Ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Staff, asked the assistant doctors to finish the strike.
Mortimer said: "Employment measures do not achieve anything but load overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, caregivers and their families only worry, need and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee on Assistive Doctors and have responded positively to the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries with regard to pre-mortem and whistleblowing concerns.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as delivery, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing training leave and gender-specific pay in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2- per day medication that can reduce cardiac pharmacology
Thousands of heart heart patients will benefit from a £2-per-day medication after the authorities have recommended that this more people be given for a longer period of time.
Remembering medication ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart disease for people with heart disease.
The medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Cardiac heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that form the walls.
If the attack breaks out, it can cause a blood clot that closes the blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.
If the blood vessel dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and close the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood vessels more unlikely.
The NICE guide, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg ticagrelor followed by 60 mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have experienced a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative effect on a person’s quality of life.
The experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of political correctness lets electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year from office on a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is deliberately ignored as a devastating government report revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to "responsibility to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, now a king of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up off-limits outside the electoral booths to protect the detained voters.
He recommends that voters take a statement with them to prove their identity in elections.
Currently, a voters must only name their names and addresses.
The report proposes to apply non-removeable ink to the finger of a person when they give their vote in order to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He called for the press to have more access to community statements and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is involved," he said.
The report was organized by the Downing Street as a result of the Hamlets Canal of Election in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the acting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his office in accordance with a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynic way" and that he had brought his critics into silence with racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman "is to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a succession in which one person chooses other than another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
In particular, he expressed alarm at the fraudulent letter - the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, represented, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the conduct of demonstrations to prove identity
His report states: "As evidence, pressure on the members of certain ethnic minorities was exerted, particularly women and young people, in order to choose, according to the will of the elderly, in particular, communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There was concern that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit newsletters to stop "whalers".
The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires stronger registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your statement.
Use non-removeable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Systematic checks on the nationality of a person shall be carried out to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter box.
It prohibits political activists from editing complete letters and envelopes of letters.
The police give the authority to set up suspensions for election stations.
An amendment which facilitates a prosecution for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksrepresentative Act 1983).
Photographic ban in polling stations.
Requirements that only English can be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees comply with the rule that voters go alone to the polling booth.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "wonderful", that after the Hamlet Tower case no criminal notice was given.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as inadvertent," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal law - for reasons.
It also criticises the ineffective "abhak controls" of the election registration departments of the Councilhouses.
Sir Eric said, "The court order in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal last year.
Our country as the mother of Parliament is a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the lying of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kates Radler Double Passer and other famous double passersby of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiad in Rio this week were made over the French bike athlete Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, apart from the edge and band, who proved to be an impressive double-walker of the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympionicin is not the only one to fight for gold, who shows his own famous doppelganger - at least not if you can give social media faith.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that flash on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain similarity to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in the bending of Brady Ellison, on the left, will be compared from his childhood to Leonardo DiCaprio
Apart from Kate's doppelganger on the bike, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain bow shield of the twinning of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The U.S. team member in the bow shot, Brady Ellison, caused a riot on Twitter after showing images that he saw in secret similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got the sense in the social media and added that he's already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see any great similarity myself, except for facial behaviour," said Brady of Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking man, so I guess I'll do it as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since 2012 will undoubtedly become even more central this year: the increasing similarity between the British White Jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actress Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is intended to be able to pass through as a double-walker for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the perception actor
Another constant comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actress Josh Hartnett, who showed similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-shaped skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by Fans to match a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Footballstar Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that other similarities have also occurred
Theory put in space: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas tournament, who shows her own beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m outdoor swimming staff impressed viewer of the CBC live transmission of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "was missing" and during the race "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m leisure pool.
MacDonald, who was taken to the CBS Commentary Team on board to give more "color", could be heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, it went away like mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers in all of Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "how did a pig die?"???
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m outdoor swimming pool for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism against Byron MacDonald came on Twitter quickly and hard when many put him on the stand
Twitter users didn't stay back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC transmission, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately-chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized to the people who responded to the comment on Twitter at the end
Commentary colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret the fact that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night on the mission and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments refer to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
However, they were unmet and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the mission and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to expose it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimsuit in the CBC Olympisendung," he said.
"I've been working on the performance of the swimmer and not on her as a person."
Of course, there was no misunderstanding, and I'm very sorry."
Buyer in Primark empires about a woman who tastes in the middle of the business of unsanitary underwear
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a price to try underwear.
To make the situation worse, she had to look like her, pull out and put her back in the regal.
She went on and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark Business in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before she put her back into the store
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the business, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwash, "she drew back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a couple of underwear out of the exhibition, pulled out her own socks and socks and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, scared like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she pulled out the underwear that she obviously didn't like, as she put it back in the gift."
She repeated the same with three other underwear, before she finally decided that she didn't feel anything, pulled herself back and went out.
"They didn't seem to disturb that she watched someone - or think about the person who would buy the undercoats she had approved under circumstances."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How can we be sure that someone would take underwear with him home, who hated another person and who had not been washed?"
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When I got along, the employees tried to get the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good."
"I'd hate to go home with a new couple of underwear and find out that another woman had caught them and pulled them out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Prmark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, 9 August in our branch office in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect With Krav Maga From Weapons Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a major master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distances.
Whether you're getting closer to yourself from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spray for your predator.
When approaching you from the back, you should turn around as the first so that you can see your attacker and "turn yourself out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting him with your free elbow on his face.
Then beat him with the knee into the joint and turn while the attacker bends before pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the running into his face and move back while they fix the weapon on him.
In the case of attackers who approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the gun line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move back and fix the weapon on him.
Sounds hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But think of it as the safest thing for a thief to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright misses his tongue for a tour guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler subjected his immune system and the Würreflex to a serious test - by exposing some of the most dirty and noble places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, dropped his trains on a Euro rail, a land on the Piccadilly Circus, a vacuum button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before skunking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will apply to.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhicker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The idea of subtracting the dust button from a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely devastating, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen shed.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Darbacterial bacteria and about his own health.
Luckily, he left nothing that he said more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public places to railway stations to toilets, the task was definitively tested by its immune system.
In the film, he said, "I was just a child, I was quite worried about my health, and I've stuck everything in my mouth, earth, worms and bad water."
In the film, he was right on his own.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample strip showed a number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to cut off after its luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhicker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film he says, "That's the worst thing I've ever smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to put anything in here because it's stupid in here.
"The Lickhicker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
Mr. Wright is taking part with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of Darbacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We went through crazy brainstorms that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claimed that the interest in oral health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the health of the stomach and how it is associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in oral health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "Let me tell you this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had looked at some of the things I had told him to look like the noble Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to bring Ian to draw them and others with whom this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty candy on film."
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed milk acid bacteria associated, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally the products containing the added milk acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed before delogation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A social family left their social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £500,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were cast after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their estate, shocked employees of the apartment society found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed striking holes, wood pieces were torn up, dust was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the household administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute dream for people here, and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is announced and her name is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had added to the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and fighting.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house that will be destroyed under circumstances, old garbage was found
It was in the possession in which drugs were dealt with in the past, the pieces of wood were cut off
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.
Delogation was enjoyed by eased neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times that we say to the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the week-long side of the municipality house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant neglected to assume any responsibility for her behaviour and her family, since a delogation is always the last step taken by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, since the conduct was extremely and their actions had to be horribly viewed by their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who have courageously come to us and let us get the information.
I hope that this development will provide some neighbours with comfort and the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that will be left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the depositation on the ground
Workers of the household administration will now have to remove Müllberge which surrounds the house
In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as wagons, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been guilty of possession of a Class B drug.
She claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without a roof, Tanya and her partner are expected to live in a private apartment in Plymouth.
Many rooms of the house were decorated with graffiti.
The police say they'll delogate tenants who don't stick to the house rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall's police told us that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This is for those who think they can act without self-defence and for those who have been damaged by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists move in Portugal in panic after a deep-flighted military beach
Sunists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft launched an incredible storm flight
The Air Force reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep - air jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft almost flew near the sunflowers on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidayers burst up when they understood to start to worry about the noise of the dunes, without first seeing what had come upon them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidayers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "It really flew through twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would collapse."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing, and it felt like the plane would drop on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were placed in panic when the plane came from the darkness and incredibly deep flight
Today, the Portuguese air forces reported that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and flying so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The speaker said that the jet, due to poor visual conditions, was somewhat deeper than usual flights, but the air forces insisted that safety had not been compromised at any time.
Surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
Today, the Portuguese air forces reported that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limited his vision
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot fishing boat had to identify as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worry against Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona fights the first step on Sunday to win the first title in the new football season.
The Catalans enter the duel around the Spanish supercup outside against the FC Seville, the back game rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must refuse to join the team with the subordinate Cup finalists and the ruling European League champion Neymar, who fights with Brazil the Olympic football tournament.
Goalia Marc-Andre is also missing.
In training, the German suffers a gang jump in the knee, which at least explains the one question at Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stepen have been betting in Barcelona for two years as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far ignored a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stepen in most other applications.
Before the first duty game of the new game time, the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a trial game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the Probation Valley against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has the 2:3 defeat in the European Supercup against Real Madrid after its extension and strives for the second triumph at the Supercopa de Espana.
Barcelona has so far won eleven record winners in this competition.
Ma Long in a own league with table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old won in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided final of his countryman and "titler" Zhang Jake 4:0 (12,5,4,4).
Thus the world rankings first achieved the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to Japan's Jun Misutani.
The two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and turned out to be the title of each other.
This made it clear that for the third time a Chinese would get the single title in the five rings.
The last non-Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SVS-NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the courts and left their shields alone in fair competition.
"The matches have been playing for my country so far."
"I'm playing for me at the final," Zhang said in effect.
Gold and silver medal winners with the Chinese flag were posted after the party.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Then he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang there only 13 points in total.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected match did not develop.
However, there was no doubt enough stunning change in the ball.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The White Russian had suffered a rape injury in his quarter final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, after which he was treated in medical treatment, had to "last" with Blech.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) were also in similar high table tennis age Olympia quarters.
Donald Trump solves ′′ violent problems in the election struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is ordered by massive concerns, including in traditional conservative states, to exploit their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now gave up his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-evident multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals into his own Republican camp from the race, the doubt of his success in the fight for the White House grew.
"We have violent problems in Utah," Trump told Evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Due to false reports about his candidacy, he again took up his well-known media records.
Waking of the Republican High Burgen
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his rival of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, however, not with the distance usual for Republican candidates in the Federal State.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview with the CNBC broadcaster Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's first march again: "Also, as I have done so far."
And look behind: "This will either be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation".
He does nothing but "tell the truth".
If it's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then that's all right, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is threatened to raise funds to support its election campaign, so it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, we want to get the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress stronger under the arms.
Olympia: Dreister fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee.
Kenya's light athletes threaten after the second Doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Uncomfortable.
After an attempt to cheat on a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee was informed that it would immediately set up a Disciplinary Commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village had given a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Doping Controls team leader Kenya.
The world association IAAF asked the IOC for information on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will conduct an evaluation," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, who passed the tests and signed," Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi explained.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich became over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World War I.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan lightweight delegate chief Michael Rotich was removed from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed sportsmen of his country's pending doping tests against payments of money.
According to media reports, he was to be arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time since numerous doping events at the IOC.
In the announcement of the IOC's more than 2000 Doping target controls in front of the Rio games, it was unusually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken into the visa.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of Olympia.
As a result, WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping combat is in accordance with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great racer nation.
The light athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a number of ARD television reports, there have been repeated allegations that the Kenya Doping funds are easily accessible and that there should be a significant mentality of the sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar study in Kenya, as he had employed in Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that this sport has been covered and systematically baptized.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, like Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classicalism and fulfilled the role of Mary a dream of youth.
In orchestral dig the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he snores.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances with Wehmut.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she's musically exceptional!
And then there would still be Mary's personality.
She says in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright".
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She is very much like me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor to work with you.
She's an unscrupulous generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dumel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in every movement, in his sight, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion, and a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly current: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the inhabitants of New York didn't want them.
They are the same topics, and they are just as powerful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London's schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died according to reports in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family experienced her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's country's bowling plant, ITV news reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had planned to leave the war - building country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and a warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war area - to stop people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other girls from East London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within less months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a election at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since its appointment by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is of the opinion that the next president will be appointed successor to the deceased judge at the High Court of Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday, Reid said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, being Lakaien and helper of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Donald Trump was unfit for the president's office.
Treats wants a Naked Calendar for "Women and Men"
The Treats Magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The Chief Editor of Treatments Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine differs from old school-playboys, since "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently he thinks it does the calendar too.
"We need to return to the display of timeless and classical nuisance, in which both women and men feel good and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release about the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting aufuffref in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality counts with mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed bags," says the president of the Golden-Next Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany counts short-term with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "one hundred thousand", according to the federation president Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh conduct of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand applicants for protection from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition," says the federation president Ali Toprak of the "world" from Friday.
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish castles with fines months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
Even secular and oppositional ethnic Turks have been added after the wounded pusch.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The Head of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitian cities.
To this end, Erdogan wants to increase the output pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been cut off or sold out in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Head of Association called for the federal government to "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters".
In Germany too, a "Hexenjagd" takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Yellow Movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurden and Opposition.
The branding as a golden trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, including the chemicalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Guulen-near Foundation of Dialogue and Education, the "world".
As the newspaper reports on numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks have already presented the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany who have been recognized for political persecution.
On Tuesday, June 30th, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all as eligible asylum-seekers (39,625).
In this survey, there are no survivors of war, poverty or prospectlessness.
Asylum-righted under the Basic Law are only politically, i.e. on the part of the State, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understand.
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Swedish Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because more blood than so far is not going on: summer holidays, heat and country day elections - that's what it's all about.
The locals, who are to be persuaded by the voters, are on vacation.
Most holidayers who are in the country on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not local, so they must not choose the country day.
Practical problems arise: In the holidays there are helpers who hang the posters, blow up air balloons, distribute flyers, and tell the end of the vote, just drive hard.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to let election battles go over to the people once again.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it's also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how strong newing AFD is cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition day.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 chief of government, makes a nearly ineffective election struggle, you look away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and spreads a little with the people, just as it has already done his legendary bearer of weight for the predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seelering received cold feet and gave Chancellor Merkel the blame for the flowering of the AFD.
Her refugee policy, her "We create this" has accelerated the rise of lawmakers, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenzo Caffier, has already experienced what it is like when you fight at the right time in the right place.
She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major events; Merkel Bundestagswöhlkreis is located in the Northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalias, Berliners and Sachsen there than Mecklenburgers and pre-pommern.
"There was probably the majority of other federal countries," said Vincent Kokert, secretary-general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it also hurt no one from other corners of Germany to hear Angela Merkel once.
On the other hand, the Northeast-CDU largely ignores the usual electoral stand on markets and in front of shopping centers with sunscreens and air balloons.
That, as Kokert says, only plays another "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that on the ground, you have to break down the basis that you have to work hard to find a wire to the people again.
You go like the left, the SPD, the green: there is hardly any place in the country.
However, the council of the CDU-Walker Kokert to his co-terrorist is also self-evident: "They must go to where it hurts, that is where people are: Villages, Golden Weddings, every birthday celebration must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election struggle.
In surveys, the Social Democrats last had 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just before the AFD (19).
In 2011 the SPD was still clear with 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).
The greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should create the spring in the country day.
They make a modern gift from the holiday need and put their election in large parts of the Internet.
"Online-Wahlfamp", it is called the country president Claudia Müller.
On the other hand, green voters are looking for local voters among the holidayers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just riding a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lake and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Walk holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27 Sanization: Hospitals suffer from constipation
At the speed with which the B 27 is repaired, there is nothing to soften.
For those responsible for the construction work starting at 5.30 a.m. and ending only by 20 p.m., there is half of all praise.
"They've done everything pretty crazy," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet Tank.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south for a half time, until the end of October, everything will be finished.
It is also promised that the responsible for the construction work will be met, for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency services.
Since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße has also been lifted in Otterdingen and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation has relaxed within the town.
Citizens can now go back to the side of the B 27 from offerdingen.
It appears that the transport through the site is going back.
"There were partly significant complaints," says Chief Officer Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the repair.
The residents of Bachsatstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of the highways were looking for and more trusted with their ship than the description.
What led to some trucks crashing in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen to be reinforced.
"There were significant exceedances," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have already been two to three per minute flashing.
The fastest was on the way in the tempo-30 zone with 77 hours.
Since the construction site has gone on, however, it has been quieter.
For business people at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.
Businessmen are not allowed to look into the cards.
But that the B 27 Sanization has led to revenue disruptions in them, let anyone who is asked to see it.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customers", so produced for other companies, for which the repair has little effect.
Also at the Maier Autohaus, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also suggests that of course "the driving skills are missing".
The locals are most heavily affected along the street.
J. Albert Gohner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
That's already a threat to existence.
Not just him, but all the guesthouses "has hit it."
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy about every euro of revenue.
It refers to "over 50 percent".
The road sensitization has "rejected its operation for two years".
Half of his employees had to leave.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Government President Jörg Schmidt asked whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the guesthouse would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it would also have to bear the disadvantages arising from the repair.
Gohner knows from other country circles where something more generous has been handled.
In all complaints, Gohner is confident that his guesthouse will continue to exist.
Finally, since 1715, the family business has been established here, it refers to the long history.
The other family guest is now less often seen due to the complicated traffic management, he can understand.
If you can't walk out, it's nice elsewhere.
The return of his family client to the end of the repair work has no doubt about it.
Despite the BSE and bird flu crises, Gohner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction works on his knowledge of the biggest crisis that has experienced his hospitality in his long history.
Six months of construction, this is already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being scurried.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a state of torture have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the condolences.
All his proposals were "politically acceptable" to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of Home Affairs in his presentation of his new security package.
They don't overload anyone.
Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved in this.
However, as the interior minister, he was placed in the result and in a "targetable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed some time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now far more extensive.
Some are already known, announced, indicated: the fact that a new security authority should take care of the bone of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on aviation data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising either.
In part, de Maizière launches a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to place sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and remove the German passport with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man says.
Nevertheless, he considered this to be acceptable and did not ask for anything that had no chance with the coalition partner.
A few new ideas also present de Maizière.
They have it in part: He plans quick procedures for removals and more opportunities to arrest people before removal.
Refugees are expected to check their smartphones in advance and to publish social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tortures for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than they have done - for example, to commit crimes or throw away their papers deliberately in order to obscure their identity.
Some of these are political and legal.
Some are still unexposed and leave questions open.
And at some points, for example, in the treatment of the patient, the question is: What does it actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be said in Abrede that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Moreover, in view of the high numbers of refugees, many people were concerned about security.
And things that people had the most deeply occupied were now not allowed to grow up even in election times.
Internal security is enormously focused.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is big.
And yes, there are electoral struggles.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking on internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
It is only a heated dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a collection of security policy ideas of some Union Interior Ministers, in which the stockpiles also demand a Burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives here for comfortable tones.
He didn't hold anything from a double pass.
We freed the debate in Germany.
Don't make any sense.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is on all corners of the constitution and whether it is actually "appropriate" for the coalition partner, it must be shown first.
It's a few things that could make for a fight.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile internal security on the topic.
"The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security."
There's still people's cars running through.
Despite Diesel Candals, delivery rates are rising worldwide.
But it's not going around in all the markets.
In the rear-facing, there is a vertebra about a term.
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries of the carrier in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest autobuilder can still have a plus in the course of the previous year, despite its many brands and some well-running markets.
In July, however, the VW's core brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus charged the total sales, as reported by the company mentioned in Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars than in the previous year in July.
Only in Western Europe, after China's second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the domestic market of Germany, the deliveries dropped by almost one sixth.
The weaker figures from July led mainly to less than two sales days in Europe.
In some core markets, there has also been a reduction in purchases due to 'changed economic conditions'.
In addition to the situation surrounding Turkey's Putschprochement, the British vote was also charged with leaving the EU, a speaker explained.
In the United States, where the gas business was first escalated, there is also another minus to book.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxonys continues to shine through the Diesel Candal: After the first seven months, only one delivery minus 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
From January to July, Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler was able to present a further sales surplus.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered cars at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to be refurbished in workshops.
In the course of the refurbishment, VW confirmed that the refurbishment of the cars had no negative effects.
After the refurbishment of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the refurbishment, the autobuilder presents the customer with a "guarantee-like" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason was legal flaws.
The "focus" had reported that Volkswagen provided its German customers with a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This had been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fulfil the tasks of my investigation commission and of the KBA in full."
"Deviations are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
The VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the refurbishment do not lead to deterioration and that all vehicle type-approval values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen himself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in business circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, a half year after refurbishment, customers will come to a workshop with engine damage - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the customer interest, it was also important to avoid any other damage that did not have anything to do with the exhaust canal, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savings in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "There are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or day money accounts".
The German Banken Federal Association speaks of a single case and does not see any sign of it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings penalty".
If banks are to save money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty.
This fee is charged by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros to giro or day money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
He has been covering 40 million euros, which one day could be cut off on the other and which he could not use.
"They are on my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend EUR 4000 for every million."
He will now continue to pay the costs in accordance with the principle of causation.
The money would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four accidents, I don't like the fifth!" said the bank manager.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of installation.
Only a few walked away to other banks.
The Bavarian Association of Societies stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes significant costs to all banks".
It is not possible to carry it on its own if it is "permanently not possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
With a penalty rate of three million euros, the Thuringia People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made a series of strikes with its Skatebank branches in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, head of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay flat-rate payments for deposits, which means that competition in Germany is too strong among banks and savings".
A banker said there is "a client who is more well equipped with wealth" on the Lake Tegern.
"This can be a problem for a small bank," when she keeps money free of charge.
The association bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branch offices in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region are famous actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The association Bayern "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate a return on deposits for private customers," said Speaker Ernst.
The president of the German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks Association (BVR), Uwe Hröhlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold of going negatively to the private customer is very, very high".
Competition was tough, and it threatened the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be allowed to do so in the widest possible way.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys soundplates?
Single men of middle age love plates.
Before you go to the comment section to pass it under the Pseudonym NotAllOne MenMiddle Ages with raw insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the very promised resurrection of soundplates is not about a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but about midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are expected to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
There is also no noise from hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog were a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I'm in the middle of a busy street in Soho running, wearing a modest grey suit and wildly sneaking, before I stand, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So let's take a closer look at it."
Well, let's take a look at that.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly integrates into its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand-made fantastic plate specialty business.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and humility by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably about 20), is a long day due to a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These billboards, shown above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his income available: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and once again bought items he sold when he was young and pale.
"Many things I buy are from the late 1960s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my cargo.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets are on the YouTube profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have been forced to buy their old records again.
From the discussions that I have conducted, people have usually left their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their discs again," he says.
This would explain the tree to the followers of the disc revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phoenix to recognize that record business offers a peaceful community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the older customers were attacked by the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to return to the stability of trusted signboard holes, of items that call for happy youth.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material owners as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like a collector with me, and I think it's like a lot of people.
It's a simple way to deal mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" one employee runs out of a record stack.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a plate last month did not yet belong to them.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while by a pile of Bossa Nova compilations I'd make it easier.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data Number: Three Men Middle Ages), has noticed a "thropohena aspect" of the Revival.
"Somebody just came in here and said, "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead dial so I can put it in the regal," he said.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-related, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older people, who just come in slowly.
Fop, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound board, has a more colorful audience than I do.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and women middle ages.
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned business - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz comes from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity with customers.
None of them looks lonely, but nurturing mental traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more of a pantyhose than a big shop.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives off with a lover of soap.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I was making the suggestion to sample Jeans' hotpants, I watched a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid Cameras before a father and his daughter pretended to buy a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at it - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some as far up as it is impossible to grasp it.
It's pure plate art.
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depth of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a group of people who have more time and money than others is also the one who spends most of their luxury items like plates.
Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov are in agreement, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums, are not taken into account.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They will certainly not spend their Thursday mornings with the thumbing through the plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through the plates, while they will think of the staring view of a mysterious, 30-year-old false moderator who does not touch on the shoulders of ignorant men of middle age.
The greenlandhai is the longest live vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that Greenland hai has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates Haie, says that the record was in a woman, from which it is estimated that it is between 272 and 512 years of age and five meters long
French Court of Justice rejects tender on the withdrawal of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to bring down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be competent, that 72 provisional cases should be brought down in which persons within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Prefecture Calais argued that these places should be destroyed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that there would be a risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups told the Court that business and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also indicated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who were engaged in 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were "absolutely reproducible."
The judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the descent was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is co-operatively operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to hold the Kids' Cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, of whom the last eight years are."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migration estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia's disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic era, Radprofi Tony Martin did not want to be defeated.
"I continue to keep the WM in sight, remain confident and fight again," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have a statement for his miserable 12th place at the sugar hut.
"I find it really hard to comment on yesterday's journey," Martin said.
He had to analyze in silence what reasons he had led to the debacle.
In October in Qatar, Martin wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in the last time."
"My position also counts," wrote the three-time World Cup winner who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at 54.5 km on the Olympics Fabian Cancelellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund missing semifinals
Laura Siegemund's victory route ended in Rio's quarter final: The world ranking 32nd from Metzingen missed a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semifinal of the Olympic tennis tournament is clear.
Siegemund, who was charged with back problems, was only able to carry out its impact once and without force compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump to the opening round.
The Australian Open winner met British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB-starters at the fourth final of summer games had been there in 1992.
There was never a German duo in an Olympic single half-final yet.
Group rises at startup for live video games transmissions
Other people to watch playing video games is a giant trend - it also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam that specializes in this hobby.
As much money is available for the takeover, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The player activity Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already on the alert.
The staff of the start-up, which has its seat in Seattle so far in the U.S. state of Washington, turn to Microsoft's headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi reported.
Therefore, the acquisition should not change anything for the customers.
Beam, according to Microsoft, is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video games activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by the Amazon online dealer - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is one of the Google Mother's Alphabets.
Here comes the Strengthening Trailer
Germany's breeders have to adjust to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, which will be particularly effective for weather criminals.
The futuristicly effective strengthening trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, to focus on accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure at motorway constructions or to repair bridges with temporary Tempolimit to ensure that the speed limit is respected by a stationary flasher.
A permanent mobile building can be too dangerous or too expensive.
The Strengthening Trailer is autarch: Its battery keeps up-to-date measurement operation for five days, the case data will be transmitted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans according to time, driving distance and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-risk mode, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily scratched, it is reduced in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and other protective outer holes.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic's data in various federal countries and is currently also being used.
Foreign authorities also flash with the new technique: Recently France ordered 100 pieces, after ordering 150 pieces last year.
Britain holds silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji holds Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of the UK at the 7th Rugby at the end of Thursday evening came to an abrupt stop at the last heat in the form of Fiji when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stretching, rear, line run and quiet force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was rewarded by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medal - the fourth of Britain on this day - and they were able to be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear downfall of the boxes, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall on them in the final.
But regardless of this form, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in best shape.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fiji Chief Trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one thing they lost.
This sleep is going to hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the GBs jump out of the pass.
It felt like it was for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running a bus. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau climbed the corner.
With another four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he turned.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A great touch of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leon Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua turned up a touchdown in the right corner and stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the replay and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovou was speeding through further weak hackings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a door.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes for half-time and closed the Fijian loops...for four minutes, which was good for the first half-time conditions until Joshua Tuisova passed through a brilliant mid-play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long gone in favour of the southern islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the Tribune.
It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame placed the i-tubfels with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pfiff throbbed, the Fiji hugged, and GB looked devastatingly beat in the grass.
Earlier on the day, Fiji had won Japan in the semifinal with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a tight semifinal match from the race - the UK conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footwork and reached a door under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant later tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the coach's cancer to defeat
There won't be any more emotional gold than these games and that's what it means.
From the first round to the last, 220 hard hives, who entered history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional importance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who were sitting on the row, there were three voices on the boat. The Echo of Trainer Robin Williams, was everywhere when they went to the second Olympic gold in the twin without a tax woman, followed by the first women in the history of British sports, who put such a standard.
Her domination was absolute, however, her 39th unbeatable use, which is also without example.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who wander over the surface with the elegance of the pigs, which does not reflect the kind of triumph at all.
Behind every gold in the ruder is a battalion of volunteers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day than cancer was diagnosed with him.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little of the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he was being treated at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could begin what the breakup meant to be a minimum, if under such circumstances the right concept is at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
It's just beginning.
It's already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.
In the immediate process of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than anything else and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a position in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. It may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much it means to me how much Helen and I have worked as well as Robin.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thanks goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I wouldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not maintain.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to lock up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "keep in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren't about to do something great.
We didn't want a fire work today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.
The couple will take a period of time for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me, and I was so stressed.
This took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 Years of Verbatim Care for Clearness
The executive director of the Association of Water Purposes "Vietensteingruppe", Ruppert Goller, goes to rest.
The relationship is considered to be "bayernwide."
A small freckle drink water supply association as an example for the large water producers.
So it was in the original tone some time ago in a contribution to the Bavarian radio.
A few years later, the Water Forum of the Government of Sub-Franks honored the Association of Purposes.
The work of the Veitensteinggroup is considered "bayer nowhere".
After all, Rupert Goller, who was a 31-year-old employee in the Association of Purposes, is 28 years old as manager.
Now he was adopted in retirement at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe with its seat in Kottendorf, the municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and provides 32 places and wells with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water delivery contracts.
The current president, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as Water Guard in 1985 and was appointed Director of the Association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and have ranged from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, fees calculation and contributions to weekend emergency investments," the president said.
As outstanding events, she called for the launch and adoption of the new springs (1994), land purchases in the area of new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the repair of the high tanks (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There was no stopping, and new developments have been taken again and again, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Goller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years ago.
He used a lot of heart blood for his water association and he lived the water association regularly as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitenstein Group to reduce nitrates in front of the water forum of the district sub-franks.
For this he has received a great deal of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterman and he was a faithful kid.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to the construction of wells and the restructuring of the Association of Purposes.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the tube fracture at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees the whole night will have to work so that the villages can be provided with water.
The supply of Neubrunn has also been possible only once because you filled Pettstadt's high tank with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who follows Rupert Goller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly turns to the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
The eight-year-old Tiago, however, has come forward and now learns privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something what is left two years ago when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bartteheide - Man shoots at life danger
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multifamily house in Bartheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday at 10.45 a.m. and killed her.
"The man himself called and told us to shoot his life companion," said one police spokesman.
The perpetrator will be on the run, followed by the public.
In the middle of the world, Sven S. could be on the road.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a glazing.
In the meantime, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a glove.
The man is not to be directly addressed.
He could still carry the gun with him, so the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. is going to call 110.
The police are talking about a relationship.
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator of 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any mention of the tather or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims; however, they confirmed that a man was killed.
"It's a murder warrant."
"We don't say anymore at the moment," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to the evidence, a special application command (SEK) was at the tatort.
Steel - Light view for the German steel industry
The crisis-related and energy-intensive German steel industry remains offset by additional costs in millions of heights.
Financial burdens that threatened the eco-strom industry are from the table.
As regards the release of the renewable energy supply for the so-called own-power plant in the German steel industry, Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Zeitung" (WAZ) said.
"I am really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of close negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the oven to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only if the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEC deposit fall by 20 per cent.
But this will also not be raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own power generation.
This will largely determine the status quo of the previous regime.
The success of Gabriel's efforts in the steel industry is of particular importance.
"In view of our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"At the same time, climate and employment objectives should be balanced in the reform of the emissions trading system," IG Metal Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt explained.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as China's largest producer country in view of the weakening domestic demand for steel placed on the world market.
European producers are putting forward price dumping to Chinese steel groups.
During this spring, the situation was somewhat relaxed.
Import duties imposed on imports of steel have been shown to have an effect, and economic prospects in China have increased.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry premium Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last time, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Finally, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July the German steel producers remained cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced with 3.4 million tonnes of good six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Union reported on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced now returned to each other in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's value by two percent.
In the coming months, the Association will be counting on an improved order situation with an increasing output.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does good for seniors
The song has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in school, in a teacher's studio she performed the field of music, and today the 78-year-olds sing in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a trial, she feels balanced, happy, and all alive, she says.
In addition, she does something good to her health and mind.
Because Singing is from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with equals, says Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can contact and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often emerge at an age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To speak and organize, to be able to rely on and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association".
Singing can be challenging in the positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly ask for their lungs do not get out of the shower at all.
Even if it's about getting the sound of the voice at an age, Singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, Singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organisations.
In the older generations, the common song had a much higher place value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even demented people are turning away from long-standing events.
In singing, the head is also required for a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, concentrate on your own voice and on a prescribed rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-esteem also grows through the singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow more than I am - strengthen this experience.
So there are good reasons to start singing.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who hears already when a sound goes down?
Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
In addition, many cities offer an overview of the audience in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the congregation or to the head of the church.
Many seniors are also found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet research.
Whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does good to the soul and has something of a liberating effect - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cats at the cries of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cats to adult animals.
To their surprise, the bride did not let the men cold either - however, they always behaved the same way to the women.
Female cats can detect the recovery rate of cats at the mill of the small ones.
They respond ten percent faster to the sounds of cats who are in great need, as scientists from the veterinary and medical college Hannover (MHH) discovered.
Cater also reacts to the calls of cats - however, always the same.
"Probably the acoustic differences between the millions of less and highly trained young males are not appreciable or important," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the length and height of the cactus shree differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the maintenance of MHH.
You were expected to be called little ones who were taken out of the dumpster for three minutes and separated from their mothers and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger built-in boilers, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be powerful despite the low sample.
"All women, even those who had not yet had their own upbringing, reacted differently to the cry," Konerding said.
They turned more quickly to the speaker when this call of the very honored cats played.
This ability may be born or develop with the sex line.
"It was a surprise that the men had responded at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans several times.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, according to biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski handle with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a arrest warrant was issued against the single football star Hakan Sükür.
He is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the Putsch experiment, an important football game is again taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the Erzrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly stated: "Business as usual".
Even when the derogation was suspended after the attempt to convert in July, the government respected that the daily population should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is responsible for the attempt.
It is also not held in front of the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the State Prosecutor issued a prison warrant.
In the meantime, sugar living in America is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür will be followers of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who will be made responsible by the president Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the first 90-day state of emergency is still in force until October, in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The Night's "Democracy Watches" in public places throughout the country explained Erdogan for the end on Wednesday.
Sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdogans.
In particular, the fans of the Labour Club Obsectas are traditionally not among the friends of the President.
What happens to the great Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military puppies.
Even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or obscitas.
With Pokalsiger "Gala" it will come back to Lukas Podolski in particular.
During the past season, the Cologner demonstrated its sporting value: With 17 towers and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playtime as the topcorer of his association.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 victory match.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the recordmaster found a comfortable conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lewes" were separated early in Europe.
In the Super Lig it was only about six.
The season wasn't good.
The Pokal was the only way to win something.
"That's what we did and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title as a Super-Lig-Torschückengeig with 26 seasons.
That is also why the fans continue to look forward to the return of the 31st year.
At that time, only Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and who was seconded to Besiktas, had announced after the Putsch experiment, did not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman quoted the magazine.
However, the storms had to be prepared to refuse to pay around one third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay its worth at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already closed twice because of Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other transferred athletes can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The theme of Doping remains as before the battle lines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who, after a Doping-Spere, had recently claimed her right of start in front of the games, was unheeded and exhaled at her start (100 meters breast).
It offered a scurrile scene: With a smile set up, she was still proud in the hall and provoked with her performance.
When she found out she wasn't gonna get gold, the audience broke out into a cheerstorm.
However, there are still many more athletes who go to the beginning of the Olympic Games in Rio despite Doping's past.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He had already been shut down twice due to dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since its ban, the 2004 Olympic winner and ex-world champion have been running even faster than before, it is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered to be Usain Bolt's biggest challenge.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price (100, 4x100-m-staff/Jamaica): The double Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to leave a six-month barrier in 2010, after receiving the pain agent oxycodon.
She had severe dental pain after surgery, the 29-year-olds defended themselves.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic winner, the 2013 World Championship, and the 2010-2016 European Championship, were tested positively on the forbidden methylhexamin stimulants.
Perkovic contests the important intake and has been blocked for six months.
The four largest posters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-stuff/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and twice world champion over 400 m, was tested in 2010 and closed for 21 months.
A means to increase penises was responsible, appreciated merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hummerwurf, Belarus): I think it's hardly an athlete who has been recognized by so many medals after all.
So Tichon lost his WM title of 2005, nine years later, after being diagnosed with testosterone baptism.
Meanwhile, the 40-year-old also had to give up Olympia silver in 2004 due to steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 due to testosterone misuse.
He also received an outstanding bronze medal from the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Court of Sport CAS.
At 80.04 m it is located on rank two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km) Go, China: The World Recorder and Goldfavoritin was only tested positive in May, but may still start in Rio.
In the 29-year-old World Master, references were found to the intake of a banned food supplement, which was released by WADA's World Anti-Doping Agency and dropped slowly on 13 July.
Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, said on Friday morning.
They have suffered cutouts and have been treated in the hospital, but they have already been able to leave.
She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is not clear at all.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in constant contact with the local authorities, as quickly as possible.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, was first exploded on Thursday night in a quarter of a million bombs.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosions again went up, and another man was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning by Phuket.
At the detonation near the beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police reports.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosion occurred in a flower field before the Coastal Police River.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast were requested by several injured.
One goes from a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin, it's called.
"The bomb night states carry the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmetavee Friday morning before journalists.
"Let's assume that it's a coordinated attack."
It was too early to comment on possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bomb nights of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamic uprising or to international terrorism.
"This is only a local sabotage that limits itself to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, it seems that the bombers of opponents of the ruling military army were put in place.
In the past days, the authorities had received classified information on alleged attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
It's still unclear which group is behind the attack.
The police directed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are increasingly smaller bombings, but they are usually not targeted at tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by King Bhumibol Aduladej.
Following the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions on its website.
High safety risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the environment.
After disagreements between security forces and Muslim populations, no necessary travel will be made in these provinces.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the militaryjunta.
This has had a major impact on the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to stifle chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryrunta, who had taken power after a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, is in favour of having restored the Kingdom to stability and order.
However, it has not been able to succeed in the military's rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu screen - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest blow of the country's younger history.
The right "identity movement" has been made in the vis-à-vis the Federal Constitutional Protection Office.
According to several country offices, the constitutionalists have also put the group under observation in the alliance.
"We see at the 'Identifying Movement' points of reference for efforts against the liberal democratic fundamental order," said author Hans-Georg Maaßen of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are severely affected.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "identity movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
She turns against "Multicultural Way", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "lost of her own identity through overcoming".
Constitutionalists in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - have already observed the "identitaries".
Maaßen said that his authority had agreed closely with the country's officials in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identifying movement' try to pick up their target group where it is," said the head of Constitutional Protection.
Generally, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
That's what Islamists do, as well as legal extremists.
This is not significant advertising for your own business.
Propaganda is meant to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Last time there were reports from several federal countries about contacts of "identity" with AFD politicians.
Maesen said he didn't have any clues.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It is clear whether the party concerned - in this case, the AFD - changes its target and becomes so extremist by certain persons who are extremist.
It is therefore crucial that such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in law-based crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard.
But in recent years we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freelance Group.
It may be clear that other right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks on other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German or European control of legal terrorism is not detectable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Concerned about measures was that many violations were committed to the account of people who were previously not in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have thus committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with legal extremists, which may have been politically indifferent or, for example, chose CDU, SPD or left, which then have been radicalized by a right-wing mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet hit
The Olympics or world record do not always determine the battle lines at the Olympics.
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros had in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that in time he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.
It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends up with a 48-second remainder of his pre-war period and represents 59th place of 59 beginners.
But it was rather his not just sports figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted a special start-up right from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries known.
As most athletes run into Ethiopia, he just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Hadte is ready for the big race.
Soon the first peaks made the rounds.
Some media referred to him as the "robel of the whale".
The English Boulevard "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not play a role there.
Compared with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's career took the media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to arrive alone in a prelude over 100 meters of freestyle.
Frenetically, Moussambani was then attacked.
The 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the match.

An open industrial lift in DTLA receives a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th birthday of the Central Library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a shop in the new place has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old director left his business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., they disappeared from the box about 250 euros.
No traces of the actor could be found.
No video surveillance is available either.
Trump doesn't see the threatening election defeat so close
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a election event in Florida.
If it doesn't happen with the choice of the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
He'll just go on a vacation.
Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, it would be relatively equal to him: "At last it will either hit, or I have a very, very beautiful, very long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the U.S. television broadcaster CNBC.
If it's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then that's all right, Trump said.
He thus referred to US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State of Terrorism (IS).
In his party, more and more resistance has been formed.
Post rises in trade with electric transporters
An electric utility vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger is obviously great.
The post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In short, the Group wants to start trading with the carrier.
The post wants to offer their electric transporters from next year also on the free car market.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether to sell to other companies their own developed StreetScooter, with the letter and packages.
Post supervisor Jürgen Gerdes had said there are always requests, for example by craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group will soon join the mass production of vehicles.
The company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and a layer in its own factory.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and target a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're converting the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on the streets of Germany since 2014.
GfK's leadership goes down to disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The retreats came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK pointed out that the chair of Managing Director Matthias Hartmann would become more uncertain as long as the success promised by him remained.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the downturn of corporate governance, the world number five of the industry is ahead of a personal start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, already leaves the Supervisory Board with effect on 12 September.
As of 1 September, the management board took over the former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company informed him.
He will officially take over the function of a "presiding speaker" until a successor has been found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to name a business speaker on Friday.
If the market research company is to be led in the future, it is still unclear.
On Friday, the shareholders were finally disappointed at the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK point since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of the recent bad business figures of GfK, any shareholder will at some time be uneasy.
"If that were the case with BMW, that would be what the Quadts would do," he said.
In the second quarter of 2016, the company could not have stopped its lost journey even after a setback in the previous quarters.
With EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With regard to the first half of the year, turnover decreased by 3.4 per cent by 721.2 million euros.
The profit in the second quarter has mainly weighed down the company's low value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company securities of 139 million euros that became necessary in the business area of Consumer Experience protected the group under the strike a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK produced another 19.7 million Group profits.
Accidents - Bus spreads in Krummhörn in graves: Eight injured
In case of an accident of a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummmörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an overload, according to their information, which was partly on the road.
The bus came to the right of the street and ran into a grave, as a spokesperson of the police officer Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Because of the situation of the bus, the people could not leave the bus by themselves," she said.
The firefight frees the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a notary car came to the crash site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back from a bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of discharge shall be as from 1 October 2016 for the area of the discharge facility Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (up to 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the discharge fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an over-calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at EUR 4.37 per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landratsamt Kulbach, it was found that there were undercovers for these sewage plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the facilities at a cost-effective level.
With effect from 1 October 2016, the citizens and commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkhal, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the money box.
The tax increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the discharge facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overcovers from the previous calculation period were also to be offset.
The gravitational increases in charges were justified by the fact that in all three sewage plants, relatively small plants are affected by a very low rainfall, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
In this way, due to the low distribution base, for example, the costs of necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the discharge of water in all three plants was slightly reduced.
Furthermore, in the subsequent calculation period, all three installations have not been significantly affected due to their age of repair and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkhal, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water plant, Azendorf had to be replaced by mechanical ventilation due to damage.
In the Welschenkhal pump plant, the nearly 20-year-old support plants had to be taken over by reason and, after almost 20 years of operation of the first clarification plant, the clarifier seal was to be removed and an additional ventilation option was introduced in order to meet the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "For these extraordinary expenses, the costs of care and maintenance were to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhauser made it clear that in the case of the low rainfall in the three installations, the costs for the operation and maintenance were "completely exceeded".
In addition, Schmidt, the market community of large maintenance costs for sewage plants has been eliminated over the past 20 years.
In the view of Steinhauser, the situation for these plants will continue to remain precarious, especially since it is not possible to extend the supply area of the freshwater basin to these plants because it is a lack of facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria accounted for 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since last October, as positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 %.
In July 2016 a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change the reality and to play with identities in a way that is already bound to absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unparalleled, property-changing tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All wrongs have reached the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they have been accused that the app Blackface would promote or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them slicing, false teeth, and exposed waves, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Gelb faces".
They wondered if these repeated controversys indicated a greater problem that the company had diversity.
News and encouragement were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company apologized: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism remembered the filter of insulting clichés.
Others rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos, wrote that the filter was "damaged and smooth."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counter-translation of a very resistant Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellowish face has been drawn to the evaluating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural perversion.
American culture seems to be developed in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are different in race than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is harmful to a user, "it's so much more difficult that such things remain undetected than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for the media and in a phone interview, she said that she believed that racial disputes reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's settings.
Zhu criticized them for most of the white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Neither do they have a different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unresponsibly unresponsible.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently appointed a staff manager who focused on under-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu told her that she would close her snapshot account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military management falsified ISIS secret service information, established by Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed news service information to make a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have permitted the actual situation on the ground, a Congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican members of the Military Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Wehrbücht Committee, reports with great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported changes in their estimates of US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Reporting service information, which was typically degenerated by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly showed a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual situation on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government officials have given Obama instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have seen themselves exposed to the pressure of their regulations to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than they were in line with the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that Mosul's military recovery could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, it is so clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressor from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's tops changed the news service reports to lower the risk by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into their lives after they were played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are being continued.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom report are carried out by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an over-restricted process for the production of news service estimates to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the high-ranking Democrat in the Committee, a member of the Adam B. Ship Representative House, announced in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Ship, "was delayed the publication of news service reports", damaged morals among analysts and "was too little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr Ship and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of the White House's intervention with the Centcom analysts on a "defined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress' findings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Inspector General of the Pentagon, which were recorded following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the Inspector General were still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have very divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have feedback on the issue of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim currently made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state recalls the doubts of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts just predicted a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current report on the Islamic State.
In the past year, the team on Mr. Hooker stated that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State did not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had been operating to sell oil on the black market.
However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situations at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to rest in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel on the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the United Kingdom before
One day after she had shot three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won with 3-0.
Five doors in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever having done that.
"I don't know." She said.
I don't belong to people who keep their doors in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympics and are in their group with the British in the first place that remain unbeatable after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the fourth final, the game will decide which of the two teams in their group from six teams will each get the first and second seats.
The first place will lead the strong Dutch people a little longer out of the way that leads to the other group.
As always the game can go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising spin by their success story, four years after they landed at the past London Games in the last 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years had a hockey match in her hands (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008, as she could not qualify for the frame.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything for her and her team shook.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman and coach of the National Team, began to make things better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the job pension in London that we now have.
We've been able to completely round the rudder.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a back hand from the nearby area.
India had gone to the game without winning in the tournament, but the team showed a surprising turn and held the game range from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled in the middle and ran the ball into the door to provide the Americans with a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. Torhütner, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a door in each of the previous games so far.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will it depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the line of the Olympic games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, as late as it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and unmistakable, a swift strike between competition and competition.
It's as if the Olympic faucet itself would be a burning rod, which is given to the triathletist by the armrest to the swimmer to the turn.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the waiting line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and is a woman's warmth with mushrooms, could have been just under these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he was a swimmer, tournament or even bolder.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event at the same time.
Next to the center, in the shadow are the sports species that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, bow shooting, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the breast-swim and we can rule it for a long time.
But if I may gently make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so exciting for the past 16 years that many of the ones I had asked did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline race and had an athlete who won it until the end of 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain external charm, partly because it is more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than it sounds for the Olympic games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a ground-bound enthusiast.
It has humouristic potential - the cartoonic cider of its never wanting to end up bloating - but also the grace of the tournament and dive, the two sports that combine it essentially.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "spring board."
Exciting winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air, and have to take a series of falling movements (drills, hooks and salts) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympia programme following execution, difficulty level and flight time.
Two-way athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will meet in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopers must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and across, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to go back and forth, up and down in the playground.
They not only pursue the finish line or the starting wall, but also another honitic goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympic Accord.
The goal is noble, wonderful, even fanatical - and it is enough to even touch a viewer to tears.
But it is also what I myself felt as a little boring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers an attempause.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she goes off, seems as hard as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then tirelessly back up.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as competition in the Olympic Games can only be.
The qualifications and finals of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13 a.m. East Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13 a.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on two days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the indication and objectiveization of male athletes - as the US male tournaments have recently suggested in The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new, air-driven fan community.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants calling for political change in Ethiopia were opposed by the government.
Witnesses say that during the clash with the police, ten protestors were killed in gunfighting.
Is Ethiopia just about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests have spread against the government in the country and are expanding in more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the Government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that policemen shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.
In the course of videos about the protests, probably from the last or early of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handle against a wall.
The Head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to bring this country together and it will be even harder in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism outside the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendulum train in Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have consistently brought the government to a halt - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively brought to silence.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed, or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in central thiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the seizure of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the governing party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions increased along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this vicious, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo liberation front or the National Ogaden liberation front, which have been more or less strained in recent years, could exploit and rearm the turbulence.
Several factors explain why feelings of irritability are now exploding under the surface after years of hinnköcheln.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxyes that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they had gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharus, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since then, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, have flourished in politics and economics, while taking advantage of the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that's also changing right away.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in the territories of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is inexorably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigris, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in observing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected for relatively impartial reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigris region of North Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tiger.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been embroiled and subsequently stolen by the government.
During the following raid, many Protestants were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendant train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misappropriation of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous form of ethnicity.
Last month Protestants attacked businesses in Gondar, an amharic city, run by Tiger, and the hate against the Tiger is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a separate position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to collapse into an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin gray walk."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to destroy the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been taken seriously by the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the candidate for the presidency of the Republicans, whether it would be able to communicate with the American public in a clear and understandable manner.
It also brings his rivals, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, to have to explain in their own position statements that he could not even have meant.
After he had made the adjudication at an election event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump retorted about the claim on Thursday and was in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day that Mr Trump said in a series of interviews, he considered the accusation entirely serious.
As the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help slow down the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism is moving down on Mr Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr Trump tried to return to this topic again.
He warned on Twitter that Mrs Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr Trump has already submitted Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he took strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I thought it sarcastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the language boundaries into politics and then to clean back to the need.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they get there, and then, if necessary, "clear" according to how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of tightening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even louder tone since his polls have continued to decline.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.
While Mr Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics for distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.
But while he was focusing his attention on the past few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's Sherze brought his loyal fellows into the uncomfortable situation to him, no matter how challenging his statements might be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent speakers, was able to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that in the presence of Obama ISIS, there was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-bankers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by submitting it to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and proposed to them to reunite on each of his words and to be put in front of him.
He warned the "poor, evil" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats complained about Mr Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once forced by the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shady café in Williamsburg, where one could only pay bar, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, he was forced by the prices from his Bedford Avenue Chargefront.
Soap Cherie, the verb replaced in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals considered it to be the last loss in a self-gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is out and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a new one.
A famous Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar light atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of time.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu there are sandwiches with spice and cheese and there are garnages such as caps and sautized mushrooms.
There are natural travel slippers.
The café no longer serves beer, so there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a constant stream of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also forced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee pot for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though on that day she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been a further long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the 2003 verb.
He went there in front of the work, and he always ordered the same.
"I came in fours after seven, every day like a Swiss bag watch and they prepare my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bag with spice, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no interest in the fact that the soap business took over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb with the cold-brown coffee of the café as a ingredient.
"I think we're still going to get on her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said he intended to expose it soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice store wants to fill the frozen coffee into bottles and sell.
There is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a tribal scientist and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the local and ordering a new coffee like a homecoming felt.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a fine taste, President Roosevelt had a weak for refined delicateities of the Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Waterschillschuppe.
His menu on this day was somewhat modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Your husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publisher, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, fast-paced imbis in Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Börsencrash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthan with potato purée and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, this couple found it appropriate to discuss food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Enriched foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There were strawberries, liver cheese and beans.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something billiards that stretch the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.
Coe's coming.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" shows the ways with which the country moved to be no longer the land of the Schlarapfäft.
"It was a time when food for Americans became a central theme," Coe asked why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was stressed: secret food such as bread and casseroles became basic foods to re-use casherole as "a wonderful kind of food remnant," said Ziegelman, since kitchens could hide undetectable ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the central point of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury served.
Own mixes were tested because a calorie-rich and nutritional satisfaction had priority over taste or even a healthy kitchen.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this era, baked twins with peanut butter.
"There was no popular addition to lunch," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and baked mushrooms do not match each other.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, economic operators - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - engaged in this kind of eating habits in the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeepers" and to meet the challenge of converting potatoes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of the historical flavors.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-Kuch-Kuchen-Hungary.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa Farm House of his kitchen, he eats like the millions of heavy men from the world to which he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with gurken sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a nearly golden dining room and wore a smoking.
He was a great stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the owner of a house with no interest in taste directions led Mrs. Roosevelt to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most trustworthy prepared."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, to deal with food, were rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs.
The majority is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple agreed to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windmill crash.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumbing dessert, President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to pass modest recipes a good name.
There was no slag, only flowers, some flour, sugar, water and lime.
Everyone accidentally dived a fork into the thick, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a tail three times.
Like a can-do-budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whales would help."
Killed by a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a phase bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to the image-time, saved almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk to get people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue from the drums of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining figure in the grey of the war.
But as a hero he never saw himself, according to the image, he said, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think God sees a murderer in me."
Shortly before Omar himself suffered an attack on the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters threw four beam bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorgas.
One woman and two children die, seven people suffer from breathlessness.
"We now eliminate the toxic remnant of the bomb, so that children do not play with it," the image quoted his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime should have met terrorists.
Greenland hai: The oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old
Rare view.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was able to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims well 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland haie is only given 150 years of age.
The greenland hai swims along the base of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 meters.
Only when it arrives, the five-metre animal accelerates at a speed of 2.6 km/h - and is at this maximum speed half as fast as a robot.
This life style marked by slowness, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland hai, which could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although evolution biologists have long suspected that Greenland hai will be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Green sharks are hard to observe, and finally they live mainly in the iceberg before the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures to the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland haie accordingly.
They measure their timepan when they equipped six animals with a transmitter before peaks.
However, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the rest of a robot, another had swallowed the jaws of a young ice bear.
Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the ground of the iceberg and search for kadaves, which from higher water layers to dry down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland hai, which fishers took to Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013 as a starting point from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens cores of the shark using the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eyelid is already formed before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks apparently had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
It should therefore be born after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons tests increased the amount of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 220 centimeters length of the smallest animal, the lens cores included a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 men in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 hour for a 493 centimeter long green hai showed an age of 335 years, while the record hai with 502 centimeters may be 392 years old.
The greenlandhai weibchen was known only when they were more than four meters long.
Now the length researchers could assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sex line and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland haie with the increase can be seen for at least one and a half centuries.
It should also be a world record for vertebrates.
It is not a coincidence that such bunsalems live mainly in icy waters.
The former record holder, a 211-year-old greenland whale, in which a 120-year-old harpoon tip was on his neck, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is also often run into sparrows.
So they mature later - and older slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very large.
For the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal heats up.
The heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a grams of elephant.
Another advantage: You have less enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Double-Packing Construction Background
Topics on construction have taken a major interest in the municipality in the recent meeting.
With relief, the board took note of the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of newly designated residential sites can finally begin".
After clarification of the land, parceling and disposal questions and applications for measurement were made, the sale of the land in the residential areas of "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - Ext. 1) is no longer in the way of interest.
The municipality is convinced that the premises in the rural and quiet residential municipality of Schönau address young families and quiet seniors alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can report immediately to the council, the municipality is expected to be consulted at its September meeting.
In order also to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other establishments linked to the creation of jobs, the municipality decided to amend the area use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
In this way, in the area of sub-timers, the area of trade is extended by two parcels towards the state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city at Main has therefore the best chance of attracting jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the field of competence, financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether cash houses can continue to operate from London out of financial businesses across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they still have the approval in the UK.
That's what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced leaving jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" has 10000 new jobs on the Main in five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), brings together the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its head office, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg was home to a large fund industry, it was more difficult to cut down on the infrastructure, as was Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
It also points the city with easily available commercial properties.
"It's not that easy to find high-quality offices in Paris," Voigtländer says.
In addition, the rentals for first-class commercial property were 50 percent higher than the Main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's corporate consulting, the city was in 7th place, Luxembourg was in 19, Dublin was in 33rd place and Paris was in 37th place.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," the IW follows.
However, despite Brexit's vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.
For this reason, the force ratios also speak: in London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba Ende 2015, about 144,000 people in the banking sector, there were 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has a claim to reimburse the costs incurred by the Hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $200 million for the violation of two Merck patents, which were linked to the Blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US ruler discovered a pattern of Merck's misbehaviour, including mineeide and other unethical actions.
On Thursday's hearing, U.S. Chief Justice Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to the expenses incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to get to Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to the year 2013, when Gilead and Merck filed mutual complaints and ownership of laboratory work, which is based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead medicines.
US-supported troops say they have regained full control of Manbi from the Islamic state
US-supported troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters left it in the city, a speaker from the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are now passing through the city after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have released over 2,000 civilians who have been held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the Manbi Military Council of Reuters associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're just doing cleaning," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax statement on Friday for 2015, this award for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and their husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clintons spent USD 1 million for well-being purposes, mainly at the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Redehonoraren; the former Foreign Minister gave a $3 million income from the Simon & Schuster magazine for her book about her time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax statements together with his wife Anne Holton for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in relation to financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In sharp contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false statements and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not required by laws because of them.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They are on the train," Clinton's election assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter about the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks are completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 in the middle of Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal to raise questions about assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business districts and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already turned on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax statement to be published.
On Thursday, she also spoke on the subject during a talk about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish his tax statements." she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that persons who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for beef, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here to exchange Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also subject to a tax examination of the IRS and Trump had "Agst" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign released a tax statement back by 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax statement of 2015 showed that it refers only to USD 100 of its income as wages, other than the majority of all Americans.
Its main account was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and incomes of USD 109 000 were taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, promote fireworks Tanzania's Elephant Protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox form to stop elephants from going to settlements inhabited by people - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuder.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its support with the US Nature Protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a violent four-stage method to protect their houses and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many muscles have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is the day of the world of children dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed this ... toolkit, within these communities we have been able to observe a change in their attitude, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a fork and the bubble in a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "chiliwoke" will be thrown away.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is on fire, the condom pops up with a tap and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A hook is usually already out to beat the elephants.
One last possibility is a fireman who shoots a gold-rearing plant into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decided unanimously: No Kiosknebau at St. Goarer Rheinifer
Normally, St. Goarer's investment projects are carried out by companies with Kusshand - but the retail trade in the city is considered to be clearly comprehensive.
However, the city council was now reluctant to reject the application for the construction of a new disco at the Rhinefer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine-Balcon in the building.
"We basically welcome new business operators, but at this location in an exposed position at the Rheinifer this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU.
Jewish director breaks down Berliner Hotel because Israel's choice of "Arab" invitation was removed - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots revealed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not made an Israeli choice, since it had "requested" Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" released his troubles at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country list of hotels.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, that Israel was eliminated and destroyed?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "intended decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
The reason behind this was even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the choice be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were disillusioned and disturbed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has contributed to precisely this hotel chain in Germany is even more scandal.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the Internet, with people calling it a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "delivered" the supposed invitations of Arab guests.
"All of you," he said in another contribution, pointing out that the hotel, which is located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the charges on its own and called the incident a "conversion" and "accused" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct direction," Israel did not enter the Quick Election List," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker from the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police set up trenengas & rubber shots against Protestant Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police set up gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began as police officers tried to drive the students apart, leading to the police using rubber and gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay on the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protestors saw graffitis spray on the walls against the provisional President Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after protesters in Massen went to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office by a Senate vote.
Trade between Russia & Iran is suddenly rising to 71% - RT Business
With the abolition of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarian, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran rose by 70.9 percent per cent per year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the Russian company's interest in business in the country grew strongly, the ambassadors said.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagarian said.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade increase was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
For this year, Dzhagarian is dating from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, about 35,000 visas, firstly travel visas, were issued to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the records of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken since last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd which have received the monuments of old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses sought: Overcoming a drinking market in forest bröl
A robbery occurred on Thursday night on the drinking market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
In the presence of a gun, three darkly dressed persons who suspected their faces demanded the release of cash from the employees of the drinking market and then ran away on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money was spent, the police don't share.
The workers should have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters, so relatively small.
The drinking market is immediately accessible and poorly visible from the rewe market deck.
After the accident in Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, the perpetrators must have escaped from the parking lot with the silver-colored car, possibly in B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has actually made observations (by 7.45 p.m.) in connection with the theft incident should report urgently to the police.
Nagold: game and fun in summer vacation
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedagogical day group/social group work of the Child Protection League Nagold with their caregivers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In a quiet holiday home Hardwäldle, the lively group was accommodated during the first week of school.
Several trips throughout the day were on the program.
One day it went to Brett with the visit of the stripeelzoos.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group experienced much about the everyday and food of the Kelten.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which included jumping, swimming and planning.
Culinary children and caregivers with their own body foods, such as the Sauren Latezle, the Seabronner Pfänlle, Iselhauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognase, were missed.
In workshops it was baptised, made beautiful pieces of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mühle game.
Other highlights of leisure were the fishing in a nearby pond, the evening at the fire and the final "Bunte evening".
On the day of the return home, the sun and children and young people were happy to return home.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to Pforte of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch unit of the soul were on the way to a four-day pilgrimage from Villelingen to Freiburg.
Four steps have been taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Roma wave of all ministers in the expected two years, the St. Anna High Minister's round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered on the occasion of the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the fort of mercy opened to it at the Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligen rooms were on their way.
Earlier in the evening, the Pilgrims sent out the Pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim Cross and distributed the Pilgrims.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villelingen, where also a Münster of Our Lady's Love is standing and so the pilgrimage was hit by the Münster.
The individual day tours were framed every morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis made the field crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim poem.
For the overnight stays, parish houses of the local parishes were available.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, it went on over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
At that time, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, had to be reached at a temperature of about 500 metres at first and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a common grill at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrim day in St. Peter's imposing monastery church, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
The Minis met in the afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and walked through the gates of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was praised here.
In the evening exhibition in the monastery, the Minis arrived at the Pilgrim's goal was welcomed by Co-operative Markus Obert.
After the service of God, the pilgrims were able to visit the priesthood and the high priest.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon it went back by train to Horb.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Shotte Callum Skinner storms home when British gold reaches for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner spent the last evening in the Men's Team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. The boy's point made the legend proud when he stormed home to accommodate a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships in spite of Hoys' retreat.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the rapporteur, Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a Hindu.
Today's restlessness created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the bulkhead, which has now spread.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinners put an Olympiare in the qualifications rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was back shortly after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change in strategy made a large part of the transformation, when the Hindus drove in a higher direction to slow him down and make it possible to keep Kenny and especially the Skinner at the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as BBC expert and fell down Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they went up to the floor.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a funny comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
In the end, we have set up an Olympiare Accord and won the World Cup.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindus said that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
In such an amazing victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like the whole GB flag on the tribune like London."
We've been together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we will expect a successful five days in Velodrom.
With the form of Kennys it is possible that he repeats the Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - who is just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a apparently holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - meant an exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the one from Hoy.
Kenny participates as next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at 3:51,942 on target.
The world record won in 2012 in London Gold was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the competition, at which Wiggins will be safely focused.
He had argued yesterday with officials before the qualification when he was called by officials to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie advanced in the world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the mid-term period of the Olympic Games and get a lot of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domination in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas played in the background, so the retreat of technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexualism and mobbing projections, as well as the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary call of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland's fusion due to the repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of the aluminium mixture of Portland in Victoria - as well as of hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby terminates all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company reported.
This step followed the Government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A grant for 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting industry consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea Power Plant last year.
Alcoa's meddling in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows the years-long speculations regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium mixture with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, reported that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting process," the company reported.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called "safety business" that would have entered into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month expiry date so that they will end in 2017.
"From this point, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the power supplier.
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong forward markets for wholesale currents.
AGL reported that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in "a expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the "ability to operate the melting or to ensure electricity supply to the melting process" was not detrimental.
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a declaration of why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn because of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the analyst's statements early in the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
If both installations were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it would not be good for us as electricity producers," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and was on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, I got the sight of this cover for wine," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgot the cover of her sister and ended it with a classic change: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-related act of almost every birthday episode of a child's delivery (seacrest brought the sentence, "Do you think we'd forgotten you?", with the honesty of a sign-thirty rabbit at a station at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With a view to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were watching it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.
With a volume that resembles a video tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertising operators (according to fashionist, 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages of advertising).
The revelation of his coverstars is expected to be so curious that in the last two years, images of the magazine were still safe before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelesta and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "familiarities that models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar Prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "passion model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even when it comes to girls).
They are really talented women who are outstanding in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the single Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called her "the mystery of the moment."
These feelings were cooked up again when the message with the appearance of the girl came out on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on the misdemeanour seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective payall apps.
She sells pictures from her made by Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure, she is watching on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kurtney and their children.
Community law centres show 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by the Community's law centres, while the industry is focused on the effects of further reductions on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, relief workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means for illegal detonation and similar - are already denied free legal advice and legal assistance on their applications.
Legal services of the community, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 per cent of their federal assets.
The director of the community rights centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Rights Centres indicated that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's community rights centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are rejected from important services that you need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with unsurpassed and overwhelming debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce the funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Secretary-General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these medium-term cuts immediately, so that people can receive the help they need in the face of legal problems.
Last year, the Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community rights centres and their customer communities and that the Government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign complaint after employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had turned a gun into an employee in February while they were in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed in the Court of Justice of Charlotte on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state.
Bordini indicated to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "it would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "received a gun, put his right sign finger on the draw, and hit the run in Vincent's Kniekelhe," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The prosecution will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered an alarm when he said a number of people in North Carolina that the "second Amendment People" - gun owners and friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should be appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not resort to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the breach of the care obligation and from Philip for physical injury and other mental damage.
Trump's press spokesman Hope Hicks was not able to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local messenger in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
He did not respond to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is called Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: survey in front of countries: lose SPD and CDU
The upcoming elections in the Federal Republic of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) show significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This presented representative surveys of the INSA Opinion Research Institute for the "Image" section (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to put the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
Thus, according to the survey, the party is just about ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is between the left and the AFD.
The left came to 19 percent (as before 18.4 percent), the AFD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the land day.
In spite of slight losses of 6 percent (up to 8.7%), the greens return to the Black Land Day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent each on the day of landing.
At the Berlin House of Representatives' Election, the survey's SPD only reached 23 percent (2011 elections: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They are still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but above the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AFD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Deputies.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope to return, but the pirates would miss the entrance in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time: 20 years ago the Nokia communicator came to the market.
The followers today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in hand either.
On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.
The built-in storage was at the beginning of eight megabytes, which would be rich today for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is currently delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 communicator" came into the business on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit Computer Fair in Hanover as a "office in the West Bank format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of SMS and e-mails for standards at that time, even by fax the communicator was able to reach.
Even access to web sites was possible through HTML browsers, even if it is extremely slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a little antenna, and the phone could be tapped like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. around 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
In August 1996, nobody realized that the communicator of the beginning of the smartphone era would become.
Since then, everything has changed.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The phone-part of the Finns experienced an unparalleled disaster, was finally sold and developed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers who came all too much later than Nokia.
Always and online everywhere, this is today for a lot of people every day.
In 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, and only 555 million of them were sold on Samsung and Apple.
Worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.
To this end, the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only beginning in 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, to use everything easily via touch screen.
Apple's win-win started, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the look.
They're disappearing. Blackberry's got to fight.
The story now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-understanding 20 years after its invention.
On average, today every German looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to even move the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, in Siemens's position for staff.
At the same time, permanent availability is considered to be a curse and a blessing.
England must link the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only renewal and prosperity in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we made a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we alone will create 10,000 new teachers, create 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport area.
As they were before us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in scientific growth and to leave an abundance of skills and employment both in order to leave the airport and in full GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - which was chosen five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal until T2, which was built between the two most frequent stages of the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we draw this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and secure our future trade and create an abundance of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretariat to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz and Mouse" about Ad Blocking
For companies that earn money online, according to one of the software manufacturers, try to run advertising blockage, a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post that announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday Facebook reported that his desktop page would change the encoding of his ads to make it difficult to identify which part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to deal with the new codes.
In a blog post, the speakers of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her-fight between the ad-blocking open source community and the environment has already been in progress since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying antblockers have become for the industry.
According to a recent study by Pagefair and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide, almost four times in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users every day who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook revenue.
The company saw it on display blockers on Desktop PCs, as mobile display blockers had no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker said.
Advertising on Desktop PCs makes enough of revenue, so Facebook appears to invest such a step as a payout.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "Advertising Preferences Tool" to give people more control over their advertising.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblocks' new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for the users, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook speaker reported in an e-mail message.
Adblockers are a stupid means, so instead we have focused on developers tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
Sewing woman in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman in the dark "in an act of despair" lay on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been recognized, but some have still not been identified, the police said that they and any witnesses of the incident are invited to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person lived in the darkness on the highway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to leave that a pedestrian was walking in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released after she had passed over and killed a man who was on the A1 one night in August 2014 near Payerner.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to a call -- went in a justifiable way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "very extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
The Venus was probably once inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere could have demonstrated similar conditions at one time.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and yet slowly moved on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid poisoning.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent more.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a rain screen to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those on earth today.
The model presented a history of Venus, similar to the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although at one time she was probably habitable, Venus -- in the course of billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned off by ultraviolet light.
As her hydrogen developed, there was only one thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as a coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and introduced too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the Association will seek a new coach immediately.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
During the summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach's vision and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned to those of the organization.
He must also have a right to vote in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who joined Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patric informed me of this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14, Roy was awarded as the best coach of the League as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the association to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the after-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches listed a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and dropped behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike out
Working struggles for the remuneration of North Sea workers are suspended, while all the fighting parties are putting themselves at the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil service provider Wood Group were sporadicly performed on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the United and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the settlement process of the current struggle," it says in a common statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin next year in order to address the problems again.
The unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group has reduced its rates to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's rate follows a 10-percent decrease for Onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the space needed to get through the market failure.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to end its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its business as a result of its mega-combination with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower raw materials prices, an economic situation which had increased by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016 less than $1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the constellations of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the constellation of the Pleiades.
The new data help the astronomers understand why stars in the constellations rotate at different rates and in what context the rotation times are associated with the planetary rise.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebul, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The constellation of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which occurred some 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these giant stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a detectable star spot -- like sun spot --
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slowly pirouettes smaller than smaller ones.
"In the Ballet of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebul said.
Since the stars of the Pleiades are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The constellation of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stealth rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebul said.
There is still much more to us that we would like to learn more about how how, when and why stars slow down their rotational rates, and so to say they hang their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspapers their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial Baseball star emerges
The tears were seen at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US Baseball Star in the best days of Base to Base.
The 41-year-old professional against Tampa Bay Rays will be wearing his New York Yankees' shirt for the last time after his emotional retreat.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Trimal was chosen Rodriguez as the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has protected him for 27 million US dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, it will function in the future as a consultant and youth coach - at full level.
As a player it paid Rodriguez a long time back with power.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005 he created the Yankees made some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-olds should not be admitted to the baseball gym.
Because so successfully Rodriguez - top name "A-Rod" - was on the field, so contesting his appearance is outside the square.
Already in 2009 the superstar at "ESPN" added that steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003 had been taken.
In August 2013, he was blocked for 211 parties due to a development in the so-called Biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have been given an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a legal dispute, the barrier was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The League could have even made a mistake for 2014 because I spent 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time.
Also, his days of separation do not run out of silence.
While many baseball legends in their last games once again received the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a divorce tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," said Yankee Coach Joe Girardi.
In fact, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz, and the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, was told that the fans of the Yankee-Earth rival Boston Red Sox were sympathetic.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at 4:9 a.m. on the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Acquired: Due to a positive doping sample, weightmaker Adrian Zielinski must not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overestimated by the first official doping cases.
A successful athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silvia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polishweight Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the uncritically critical athletic contests, these messages come to an unexpected conclusion.
In Chen, the diuretic of hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, has already been demonstrated on Sunday.
The International Court of Sport CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-olds had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Schmetterling, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have participated in the pre-wars over 50 m of freestyle.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-test and a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations", Xinhua quoted a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Justice CAS and accept the ruling".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the message about the positive test at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went to the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she told the Bulgarian TV broadcast BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the light athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be used for the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT the B sample should also be positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported his criticism of the Athletics.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, for example, all weight gainers from the chronic doping-loaded nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case was also known as "Adrian Zielinski", the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days before positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both contest the intake, however, both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Prior to the start of the light athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another difficult blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF World Association had prevented the start of the complete Russian team up to an exception due to systematic doping, and the Kenyan Laufernation produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the sport of swimming, the previous events in China also provided for strong confrontations between athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard.
"Sun The Pink Pink."
"When I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time or respect for doping predators," he said.
Sun was tested in 2014 in the Chinese championships positively on the Stimulant Trimetazidin, but only a three-month barrier had to be removed.
Data Key: So Perfectly Express Hacker their ransom money
Programmers of repression malware are currently targeting targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey of the Malware defence specialists, Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed were at least once in the past 12 months, partly the victims of an attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already target of a ransomware printing.
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the damages required by the workers in order to be able to reuse the systems and data they attacked.
The perpetrators specialize in their epressive software according to the observations of Malwarebytes in particular on attacks in corporate networks.
If it is successful there, the potential solution is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a frightening fast evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in the conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered the compression software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place terribly quickly in the past few months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, it looks for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the oppressors.
To get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the bitcoin crypto currency.
But where private users have the personal photo database at stake, companies have sensitive customer data or project databases that do not stop production.
Therefore, the damage is higher if a ransomware is added.
22% of the German companies concerned reported revenue losses by Ransomware, 13% even had to stop business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be severely threatened by the loss of disease.
"We always say to the victims: don't count, you only support the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for the manager to reject the demands of the perpetrators, given the state of the operation.
In turn, the hackers know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In an up-to-date study, F-Secure's security researchers examined the user surfaces and the contact with the oppressors and came to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by bitcoin, direct freely available support websites to or decrypt otherwise example files.
And after payments of a few hundred euros, private persons are redeemed, companies have to negotiate in part and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencumbered.
In view of the potential high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware oppression, the hackers will become more professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware about a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building box to the actual oppressors.
The previous Malware kits were created by purchasing the Malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"Contained in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
Then the rapists are looking for more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums in the background, buys the set from a criminal and orders another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"usually the criminals then order spammer with the distribution," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of the company's IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust in being able to resist ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the actors are already pursuing new strategies.
"If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, according to the type of data, the damage potential is even more numerous than before.
In the future, the actors could also take up new goals in the Internet of Things on the grain.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the freezing of such a blocked heat could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a whole manufacturing road in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for All Cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
It sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually proved to be highly flexible throughout the day.
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the foundation, it does not work at all.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and appear pleasant, only the cockpit top is slightly down there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the stauraum.
Not only is there a 453 l case room available for high and 1026 l for covered back loans, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seat of the backbank can climb up like a kinosassel and thus offer a stauraum, which is from the ground to the ceiling of 1.24 m.
The trunk can be loaded well, however, the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotational ranges.
However, he should do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l gasoline with 96 kW/130 PS.
An all-purpose drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the drive should be something more direct.
The equipment does not allow the "Executive" to be opened in the tested top variant.
The security systems include the City Emergency Assistant (worked up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the tracer.
The collision Warner is sometimes irritated because when ranking many obstacles as "relevant objects".
The remote control is very reliable.
And the intelligent tempo regulation reacts to traffic sign recognition and drains speed if necessary.
But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI book are under the armpit and are therefore somewhat accessible.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline does not depend on: crashing on flight bridges
An airline is not responsible for the crash of a passenger on the flight deck.
As a liability is only conceivable in the case of hazards typical of air traffic, the Superior Court of Justice Düsseldorf argued (Ag.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a hard drive at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, so the Court of Justice.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness: When the organizer pays
Sick vacationers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness is beyond doubt in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the case negotiated, a family was seriously ill on the second day of their Turkish leave.
She spent almost all her vacation in the room.
Their illness led the vacationers back to a defective clearing facility that allegedly had polluted the seawater.
The family was the view that the trip was so flawed and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success before the court.
Even though the clearing system was actually defective.
However, the organizer first learned about this shortly before the charges were dropped.
He had to leave until then that seawater was all right.
So he didn't violate his information obligations, so the verdict.
There were no contaminations found in the samples of water.
The illness of several hotel guests - perhaps by interfering with each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would have been concerned about further attacks.
The state must be united and determined to respond to threats of terrorism at the same time.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
This triumph will not be won by the terrorists.
If criminals were to leave the country faster, however, it would increase security and also strengthen the people's agreement on refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 federal election.
He also announced a further personal strengthening of the security forces, "in the middle quadrilateral order over several years".
Sympathy for terrorism had to be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve, the law of weapons is so renouncing that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is difficult.
The most recently discussed obligation for doctors to remain silent should be followed by the words of the Maizière.
However, he wanted to look for solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession, how the danger of the citizens could be reduced, he said, with a view to mental disorders.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers needed to be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
For the prosecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has made himself clear against activism.
"This was an earmark for the sharps in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously refused to sign a Burka ban from the Union and the abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of full disclosure is considered to be a constitutional problem.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
We can talk about rules in road transport or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter suggested to the Minister that he always want to simulate action and effectiveness with new anti-terrorism packages.
Left-Party Bernd Riexinger said, "Flott speech and an increase in the right of residence no longer brings security to people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the road transporter
It stands regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture from November.
But this is to change: the legal challenge is to be extended.
This is a good message for all car drivers who stand in the road of the environment every evening when they drive over the highway (A 43).
On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16th 17th August) the road operation extends the law enforcement trail by 700 metres in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure of Weseler Straße.
Car drivers can then directly slide right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage: Transport is increasing early, thus improving the overall flow on the highly endangered section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the area represented Münster-West.
The driver's cab on the trailer is particularly nervous between 17 and 19 hours.
Working days are enough to get back to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle watch on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From this point on, traffic is only one-sided over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt almost twenty-four years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required carrying force to take up the heavy traffic twice as much as possible.
As long as this engpass and the associated working time will last, the competent country operator cannot say.
However, it is to be calculated with years: because the bridge has an official residual period until 2034.
For the extension of the legal loopholes, the country's operation has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the schools because it is to be counted with obstacles.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the traffic will be carried over unanimously at the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the young theatre are planning a music project now.
The association Nima's allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Children's House has visited a presentation of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Boy Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Trip" initiated by Nima's Association, 19 students visited the stage in the Small House between eleven and 15 years old.
Since the beginning of the year, the Association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most of the young people of the class came from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of action, so the press release of the Boy Theatre Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tanaz Westerberg from the language, and the young theatre will work together in the next play period in the context of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration backgrounds between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professionally gifted courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offerings for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language communication are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association counts with many classes who want to participate.
Rain Instead of Starbucks: Hope for Weather Improvement
The weather has made the starbuster sugars in southwestern Germany in the night for Friday through the bill - but there is hope.
The night was bad because of clouds and rain to watch the sky, said the president of the Star Warte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is at night for Saturday.
The weather's supposed to be good, so we're sure to see a lot of stars in the sky.
For the stars, it is the most fast-paced faces with 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their names, because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips against Sleeping Disorders
In the evening one turns around forever, in the night one wakes up for hours, in the morning it is already far from the winter bell to think of sleep.
That's all but relaxing.
There are such problems in good society: according to Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent often experience sleep or permanent sleep as unrestable.
How are sleep problems or sleep disorders expressed?
There are several forms of sleep disorder, and there may be a variety of reasons for them, says Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand underground is, but the insomnia is, that is, an insomnia and sleep disorder.
Just as many people feel sleepless or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member in the German Home Doctor's Association with Practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disturbances?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Afterwards, organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medications, can be applied.
Sleep disorder is not uncommonly an expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is especially common in depression," says Weess.
And it can be that different factors work together.
For example, someone who has an accident can lie down badly, wakes up every two to three hours, and perhaps begins to grumble about everyday problems and concerns.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
Since when should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who is not well asleep for a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should consult the doctor.
The impact may seem quite different: you are tired, tired, unsleepy, have difficulty with attention and concentration, are easily alert, have mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
It is important to find out the causes of sleep disorder.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
In Germany there is hardly a low level of sleep medicine, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, you should first contact your doctor for sleep problems, advise Weß.
It can be explained by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the bedroom, and what's going on?
For a study in the sleeping laboratory, physicians recommend, for example, snorkeling with breath-absorbers, diseased daily fatigue, sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, vietze explains.
You don't actually have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't sleep in the middle of the day," says Fietze.
After the cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a noseglass, a chest belt and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the roof shows the sleeping.
How can the problems of the affected be addressed?
There are quite a lot of job screws to which you can apply for a better sleep.
We know: Regular sleeping and waking hours, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not sleeping on TV, drinking and not looking at the clock at night - then you start counting immediately, and that's quite not encouraging at all.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Debler expressed himself on Facebook to disillusion the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the short-track world championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Debilr has been protecting himself from his former teammates who are critical.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets €20,000 and a jungle king €150,000 should no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The promotion system in swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.
Thus we cannot compete with countries that are very supportive and do not look at the subject exactly or even operate it.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be set here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Debelr had to be notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly how you should keep it with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM/OS by the WADA/FINA independent controllers must not participate," the election Hamburger, currently operating an ice-cream, asks.
Airport: Band of luggage depth arrested
Professional thief at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, Düsseldorf police civilians managed to arrest two women and two men between 50 and 61 years of age.
The suspects had gone through several pockets and luggage counts as gangs.
By 21:30 p.m., civil officials in Düsseldorf Airport again recognized a band known to the police from past thefts.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year, and they had gone together, working and particularly professionally.
The Specialists of the Criminal Commissioner's Office 34 can prove four acts to the thieves, who were in charge of committing crimes to Germany.
They had totaled over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in the meantime another headstone patch: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police count it as the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you go from east to west, you get to playgrounds, a fresh-circuited kindergarten and a biocharger.
On the façade of a grey house someone has sprayed "wonderful!".
Against a Lidl, which is to be destroyed soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created.
However, articles on this "trend district", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, by the time the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground, still have rooms and are used for events.
In particular, the Berlin Indensenator Henkel had repeatedly spoken against the project for a hard operation by the police since the beginning of the year, which referred to the area as "no-go-zone" for police and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On 22 June, after the rooms on the ground floor, which had been cleared by 300 police officers, the police patrolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on the ground, blocked parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, the rooms were renovated by construction workers on behalf of the unknown houseowners.
On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the premises were illegal, and one day police and construction workers withdrew under the delight of sympathetics and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the stairs in front of the houses in the sun, others take a good look at Späti.
A primary school and kindergarten are located near the house.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neubauer, who has been living in Kyez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.
They share the care of increasing rent and genital mutilation with the residents of the home projects.
It doesn't sound like a cheese that most of the police have wanted to protect itself from vandalizing links.
The grave, which the Berlin Interior Senator and the police open between homeowners and their neighbors, does not exist so apparently.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty today compared to the rest of the city.
The houses and the housing projects from which they were born have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street near Riga.
While the Mainzers were hiding under a large police offer in a regular street fight, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become the magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them residents from DDR times and former houseowners share their Kiez.
This is also noticeable for the rentals that have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on inserted discs or freshly cut façades, which have been cast with colour pencils.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "lnkautonome violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as physical injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the crimes are committed in case of damage, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neubauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As for violence, it is overwhelming: The people in 94 are their neighbours, who were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in the rigaer.
For the studied architects, their road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the road and get more from each other than from elsewhere".
The new building is deliberately moved to Riga Street - and remained.
That was why it was so important for the residents to return to their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the height of proof across the city in July.
However, in the eyes of inhabitants like Neubauer, the road will continue to be taken away from them: through invisible new buildings in former buildings that oppress the old inhabitants.
"They are, in the end, properties that are not interesting to many here - rather people who are not so well-known here," she says.
"Gealty and destruction can't be good enough."
But what should you do if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neubauer has little understanding for the trainees who are angry with paints: The house projects and the left scenes belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who turns should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a cage area can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Anika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in integration and organizer.
She is also an on-site social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The Sozialpädagogin supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working circle Refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine customer from the working circle indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the venisoned wool milk sauce, which has a problem in particular.
In this way, some - less ridiculed rather than aimed at the multitude of tasks desired - meant that the administration wanted to write the place out.
An administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, as well as an ovaries of wool.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, work with people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been at it for about six weeks.
She's frozen a 50-percent cell in three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regina Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and top-level actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers are soon on the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding apartments for the joining refugees who have been recognized for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
You have to accommodate the refugees in your own or rented living rooms.
The cost of the construction, rental or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Land Council to the municipality and the work centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been making itself very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work until now, in which you are directed to private apartments, so Deuschle.
Therefore, community apartments must be enchanted, as it is called.
So soon new containers will be installed on the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it's not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regina customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a firm stay, there are practical places, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regina customer.
Many work in the Bauchtof or help homemasters, perform non-profit work - and that is motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
That's not "employment therapy".
But activity is not just a matter of work.
The day needs a solid structure, they say Deuschle and customers.
People had to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So there are also administrations and dignitaries in here.
It is vital that refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it is just going to last and that they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.
Whoever ever develops the feeling, he can't help anyone in Urbach, he can't work and be useless, he'll never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But problems also exist, says Customer honestly, "People with nothing to do". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and Customer is always to motivate others.
It's all a mom job.
A difficult question: Are the two of them afraid of radicalisation after the latest occurrences, even in a small town like Urbach?
"No," says Regina Kunde quite clearly, "what some naive may call it." A risk can and will not exclude them.
Sensitized, however, are the helpers already.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They were afraid that the attackers would bring them to a complete end.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regina Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
The main officials must therefore keep an eye on the site and in the region.
They are always in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, the policy is changing.
In fact, it is unfair to place them on site.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we can," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the urbachers are already out of the way to integrate the people who have been before.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Shrewdortrf: Breakers with Hubschrauber sought
For about an hour, the police raider flew out of several areas.
Two unknown men entered an apartment in a multifamily house in Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 p.m.
The inhabitants were surprised and fled.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, wearing both Bluejeans and black capuzen pullis.
They ran toward the city center.
The police set up several strip crews as well as a police helicopter.
The capture fell without success.
If possible, the unknown came close to the apartment in the face of their flight.
Baden-Württemberg: Police detected after a rocker attack on Imbis
After an attack on an Ulmer Imbis, the police detect six suspects from the Rocker Environment because of a serious land peace break.
In the case of housing investigations, evidence and miscarriage were secured, the police informed him on Friday.
Around 20 masked men of a rock-like group had, according to the police in July, thrown bottles and stones against the shingles of an impasse.
Then they should have attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
Then they ran away.
A damage of EUR 10000 occurred at the imbis and adjacent building.
According to the investigator, there is a dispute in the Ulmer Rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
