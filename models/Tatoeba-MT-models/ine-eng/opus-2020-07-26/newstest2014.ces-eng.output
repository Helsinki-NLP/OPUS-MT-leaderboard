Black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying hard to find the money for repairs that break down the road network, many start to see solutions in a small black box that can easily enter the device board of your car.
The devices that follow every km that the driver uses, which transmits this information to the authorities, are the core of Washington's controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renew the outdated US main road financing system.
Usually fake road design has all of a sudden led to intensive debate and the creation of the most diverse companies.
The libertarians met with groups of ecologists and were lobbying for the government to use these small boxes, which would record the miles and maybe even where you're going – and then use this information to build a tax dimension.
The Tea Party is scared.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of issues with privacy protection.
And while Congress can't agree to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They see how they can move over the next decade to the system in which the driver pays for the km of the road he is driving.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"It's a matter of how much we can choose," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Association of State Administration in Southern California, which plans to start monitoring the kilometres taken by each California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
That's what this technology is for.
The reason for this is that the Road Trust Fund financed from the taxes paid by the Americans at the pump stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
The cars will spend a lot more miles on one gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians are able to raise taxes only by a single cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently set up a tracking device to 500 cars to test this payment system for one mile away.
"For a long time it seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is no surprise that this idea is popular with urban liberals because taxes can be used to change drivers' behaviour patterns, which can, for example, help reduce traffic congestion and the production of greenhouse gases.
California designers look at this system in planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But the Republican Bill Schuster (representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transport Committee, said he also saw it as the most functional long-term alternative.
The representatives of the Free Market of the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will be paid for miles.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Strategy in Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who in 2011 urged Congress to pay for a kilometer payment.
The US Senate approved a 90 million-dollar pilot project last year, which included about 10,000 cars.
However, the recording of representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the fears of rural legislators representing the content of the population, whose daily life often means hurting many kilometres outside the city.
However, several states and cities move forward on their own.
The hottest is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying taxes for miles, instead of gas taxes.
The pilot project has already been completed.
New York is just examining the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in freight vehicles.
And coalitions I-95, which include 17 state transport ministries, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), study how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not have a single stop.
In Nevada, where the equipment had recently equipped about 50 cars of volunteers, the driver was concerned that the government was able to monitor each of their movements.
"The concerns of monitoring Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs the management of the strategy and operation at the Nevaska Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its websites: “It would be very easy to turn these facilities into a necessary monitoring facility.”
There is no need to build an enormously difficult technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand on the record of daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
The problem is between a number of states that are trying to find the available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many kilometers of the train is to be found, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
She has introduced some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (a real long distance).
This company was originally not involved in the government’s action in taxing drivers.
She wanted to go through the emerging market to ensure legal responsibility where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they ate.
But this device, which is trying, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only supplies a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to go unless you follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
A number of major errors occurred in some of these pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less powerful ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with GPS or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead they will decide to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of kilometres taken by all the inhabitants of the State.
In other places, they hope that the prudent public will come to this concept if the device is able to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop tax facilities that would be so equipped that it is also possible to pay charges for parking hours to provide insurance according to the kilometres taken and to collect data on the speed of other drivers so that drivers can avoid traffic congestion.
"Motors will be willing to take part in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's projection document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussion about pay per kilometer is not just a huge problem.
Officials of the Metropolitan Committee for Transport in the area of the San Francisco Bay say that Congress could easily solve the problem with the bankruptcy of the Road Trust Fund by increasing the tax on petrol.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid or other vehicles that do not need a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for a radical operation when it is rich enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
ČSSD is negotiating Saturday.
Social democracy is talking to fools, people, and grandmothers together, and they are going through a common procedure.
If the social democrats are confused for a few weeks, they will be sitting at the action table with perfectly trained partners, who will put a list of requirements on the table, including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD envoys then either be a coalic acid threat, or a worm to a garden minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka was first attacked after four days when he was on the wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political game and, above all, to bring the convicted liars to a standstill.
The confirmed negotiator is currently only he, the other members of the team will be allowed until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (OECD).
I apologized to the members of the jury and now to the citizens.
He doesn't lie, in his personal life, in the public.
"It was a mistake," said Michael Hasek after the discussion of the southernmost leadership of social democracy.
He added that he didn't have to be the first vice president.
"I'll make my decision on November 10th," Hasek said.
Similarly, ČSSD Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and Head of Deputy Club Jerome Tejc spoke.
But he pointed out that he was elected only two days ago.
Both MPs then declared that they were doing everything to make the 50th Club of the ČSSD sound one voice.
To the absurd theater, Michael Hašek said: "I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her brand and I have respected the decision of the party authorities."
Chili's another lie in direct transmission.
Or, in response to Sobotko's resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team, did he forget that August UVV had 57 percent of the vote in favour of Bohuslav Sobotka as a candidate for the Prime Minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, made a powerful army of enemies by sending UVVs until next Sunday.
Its opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media of the most diverse dwarves and fam, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotkov's political career.
The dirty laundry will be thoroughly washed, the signs of the dark connections between Zdeňk Bacal and Sobotk's wing will appear.
The friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radka Pokořni will be discussed.
There are disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian Association of the ČSSD.
The words of the island prime minister and Sobotk's union Peter Kajnar: "Chart 77 I signed so that the countries don't rule the idiots."
If the U.S.A. met this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
The traitors will shake their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of ČSSD will then end with the nickname Bohuslav Pirrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Soči: Communication with Russia is demanding
The eyes of his mouth indicate an immoderate smile, and then he'll just breathe deep: "It's difficult."
Working with the organization team of the Olympics in Soči 2014 is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things are slowing down, not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of the invoices they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on basic matters no longer so much.
Perhaps we have spent three months adding to the official marking of individual villages so that we can do a whole series of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
In a number of things, they keep communicating.
Is there at least a delivery of the Olympic Village?
But it's no longer a disastrous situation.
A month ago, we were walking through empty rooms.
Good luck with the houses.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, so that's how it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on the 26th of January as a premonition, it'll still feel sticky.
And if they didn't, then what?
President Putin, would you think he'd go after the army?
That's what I think it's gonna happen.
Just so it won't be that the Olympic village = the dark village.
They're more at risk of not getting a road change, for example, not getting details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we'll have to take the holini from the London games.
But I believe they're kind of giving it to the store.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the croissors are going to the three things they ate.
There's no one to doubt about Martin Sáblík's fast brewer, either, but otherwise it's in development.
Still waiting for you on your way to Sochi?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
We know what houses in the Olympic village are gonna look like.
We even measured some things by ourselves so that we wouldn't believe just the charts.
We're also preparing a whole series of other things, including transportation.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus making a regular agenda in terms of communication with the Soči organizational committee.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, his plan to hide huge secrets
The fans of winter sports are already cutting the meter to start the Olympics in Sochi, while others are increasingly concerned about their preparation.
The Russian Olympic, if it starts in February, it's dealing with another scandal.
According to all, the Russians are not able to fulfill their promise that the preparation and performance of the game will not disrupt the nature of the country in Krasnodar, at the foot of the Kavkaz, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be targeted.
Most recently, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russian flag was very high, Canadian games recorded in the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
It seems, however, that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize the games with "zero waste" has long since taken place.
Reporters of the AP agency discovered a huge building material collection in the village of Achtyr near Sochi last week.
Thus, the bottle of building material, pneumatics, canisters and insulating foams have already been found in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities are gone.
Just for a moment.
Last week, the reporters were given an overview of the three football matches.
She's not the only one, in the area of places like this, he wrote the British letter The Times.
The site is operated by Russian railways, a state monopoly, which builds about 16 kilometres between the airport in Soči and the sports resort.
The company, which already had 280 billion rubles, led one of the close Putin co-workers Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways defended that the warehouse was founded by one of the subcontractors.
Locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Ashtyr, all around three months of the night and day, they are driving trucks full of waste material.
According to experts, waste is being contaminated by the local rivers of Smith, other rivers, and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here pollutes soch water streams for the next ten to fifteen years," said the British newspaper Vladimir Kimaev of the EWNC Environmental Non-profit Organization.
The illegal stockpiles are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history are, according to the opposition, one big tunnel.
To compare: Sochi's games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 annual Beijing Olympics will be 43 billion.
Last year's games in London stood only 19 billion and the above-mentioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns, if there is to be enough snow, reports have also appeared that human rights are not respected when working on the exhibition of sports and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers put his mouth on a protest that he didn't get two months paid.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are following a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during the game.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple grew up living with their parents, a new house offers private to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates has been given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself somewhat narrowing.
The requirement further stated that two generations would live in the house who wanted to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly frozen ground.
Architects therefore decided to place each household into one of the floors of the house.
"When we made the proposal, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected by several routes through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their own privacy," the designers explained.
The home of parents is at the level of the garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories apply.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, which is different from the final editing of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is of concrete, the surface of which has been constructed using panels from the floor, the part where the office is, is white and the remaining elements remain in clean concrete implementation without further adjustments.
Many walls of the house are completely paved, which makes the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
The home of parents, more precise kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is submerged by a side wall that starts in the garden and continues until the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house with the main entrance to the hall and then step up the stairs into their space.
It's just that the damage is the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their construction enables them to destroy a lot of natural light through their cascade.
This is exactly what the architects tried to distinguish the house from the others and print it something unique.
The home of a young couple is arranged as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living together.
From the terrace, it's only a glass wall with a sliding door.
A living area with a dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that passes freely on the terrace, from which is a nice view of the Tokyo Gulf.
The single office at the highest level is identified in a clean combination of white and black.
The vault is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple come into the house with the main entrance, they feel in the entrance hall, and then from there they step up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, it's for Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, teachers and seniors in a number of countries to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Milos Zeman at the schools.
I've met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the presentation of the honorary president of SPOZ-Zemanovici during the pre-election period, even received an invitation to the State Hall of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of the representatives of schools who were not so static anymore and who made it possible to visit Milos Zeman: High Technical Learning in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, High Business School in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyno in Ústí nad Lab.
We now meet in Pardubice with the continuation of policy promotion in high schools.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, the dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and also seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not like you're staying in the mayor's office, for example.
Do you want to join the ČSSD Heitmans who are currently performing the functions of MPs and Heitmans and as well as they are degrading both appointments?
That's what you're saying to people that they can handle both of these demanding functions on the left.
I know, we have the example of Michal Haška, who manages even a few dozens of functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly the example of the person you should drive.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Frankova, who prefers to leave the post so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean's function is, however, that in the course of the functions you disrupt the apolyticity of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the pardubic ODS sees your current action on both posts as an advantage for the University.
"Your" school, however, will be able to help you without staying a dean.
I think the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So consider your retreat and maintain your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count on you in the next elections.
And it doesn't have to take a long time.
In Kunovice's bubbly greens, chemistry doesn't add to it
More than a thousand tons of acidified herbs want to be produced in the next few months in the Slovak Fruit Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season here began in October and will last about half a year.
A healthy appetite here since 1925 is still produced in a traditional way, i.e. by smoking directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our staff found a trail for the change of almost ten-kilometre route.
In each of the ten tanks there will be fifteen to thirty tons of green, one filling takes three shifts," said the director of the Slovak Fruit David Kladrob race.
The yellow heads drive directly from their fields from Ostrožska and Břeclavska.
The employees of Fruity then clean the vegetables, remove the cookies and throw them into the oven.
From there the already painted green falls into the pools with a six - foot - deep - deep depth, in which undamaged wetlands are worked in white clothes and holines.
That's what makes unwelcome air feel good.
The last layer of yellow will be covered with a cloth and filled with water.
"The green round then matures six to eight weeks of spontaneous milking without any add-on to the supportive chewing substances," said Director Kladrob.
The natural process corresponds to the production under domestic conditions, and the individual levels of workers are salt-salted and germ-salted.
He travels to the filling line after drying.
It is wrapped in a sugarcane into bags or bottles and is treated with sterilisation.
Hame is supplying acidified desires primarily to the foreign and Slovenian markets.
The interest is also recorded in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to US monitoring
Edward Snowden, an American reporter, announced that he would be willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander would not be able to provide answers to questions about his activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Strübele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, who delivered the press in Berlin on Friday, he said: "Although the outcome of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to act as a fugitive and is trying to criminalize political statements with heavy complaints that do not give room for defence."
It's not a crime to tell the truth.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to bring charges of criminal offences against it.
The charges imposed by the United States Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said about Zeit Online magazine: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
The tension between the U.S. and Germany began to rise when a claim was made that the NSA was listening to the phone from the office of Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who is leading a parliamentary panel that is monitoring the report, said that if it were any opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the United States", it should be done.
Mr Strebele, the MP on the German side of the Greens, published a photo on his Twitter contribution with Mr Snowden.
Two German journalists accompanied her on their way to Russia.
Mr. Strebele said that according to the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe," a member of parliament said.
Mr. Snowden in his letter said he was facing a tough and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that forced him to leave home.
He said, however, that he was encouraged by the response of the whole world to his "political expression."
Citizens of all and the senior officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the discovery of an unwarranted system of universal public monitoring.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "that the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be solved."
Killing us is a pity, but we're innocent, they're playing with the Red Khmers.
Nuon Chea was number two in the hierarchy of the Red Khmers and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
According to the Government of the Red Khmers, which was based in 1975 to 1979 on a mixture of mosaics and nationalism, life was lost as a result of extermination, hunger, disease, torture and repair of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population then.
Tomuto, the unrecognised commander of the S-21 prison, granted the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia a life sentence in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, bribery and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were embarrassed by believing that they acted in the best interests of the people and did not know what the real extent of killing is.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything, and then touch and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered the Red Khmer camp to "behave badly with people or kill them to resist food or commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to apologize sincerely to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all Cambodian people," he said.
Fifteen-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Red Khmer regime, said the AFP agency can't accept Nuon Chea's apology."
"He lied to us."
"Only he wants to be forgiven."
"He's not taking care of the second," she said.
"If he hadn't issued orders, his orders wouldn't have killed," she added, "the leaders of the Khmers are worse than the monster."
He was also to be a foreign minister of the Red Khmer regime Ieng Sary, who died this year in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012, the court found an inability trial for dementia.
The leader of the Red Khmer Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to pay for manual baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 for the deposit of a handbag on board during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 per hand luggage and 2 USD for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday they said that travellers will be able to leave the whole bottle.
The new fee for the hand luggage relates to the luggage in the upper spare space, so the small luggage under the seat will remain free.
Frontier says it will charge 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 USD if the passengers wait with the payment until the arrival of the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley's spokesperson stated that a hundred-dollar fee should encourage the traveller to take care of the payment ahead.
"We would hate to choose this fee," she said.
The airlines started to apply the first and second commitments in 2008.
Travellers tried to avoid these fees and stuck in the handbags hidden in the spare space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one way of teaching passengers to get less things on board.
O'Malley said the meaning of this new fee really isn't to get more money.
The point is that Frontier's most trusted customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the top spare space is still more difficult.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one traveler in front of Frontier's gate can bring a luggage for which he pays nothing, while the other traveler in front will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said web sites and recovery procedures would be adjusted to ensure that passengers would learn about the fee before coming to the gate.
The new Frontier fee for the handbag will not yet be in force before the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Travelers often complain about charges for luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of the purse is worth money, and passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street take another fee for the luggage as a sign that airlines are trying to pick up enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of loss.
Most of the charges for handbags were not met.
Spirit Airlines was the first to apply the handbags three years ago and another low-cost company Allegiant Air followed its example later.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, Spirit estimated that the fee for the handbags would be US$ 50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew to Spirit and wondered what he saw at the door when the travelers met with an unusual payment of Spirit for a handbag.
"The approach to the aircraft was the fastest I've ever seen in my flight career," he said.
I was expecting to see a toothbrush and a fight at the door.
The plane was full, he said, "and the approach went through the muscle."
Frontier also uses the Spirit to pay for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier stated that travellers who get lemonade or juice can leave the whole bottle and the coffee will be added free of charge.
The water will continue to be given free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to introduce drinks charges, but after complaints from passengers seven months later, it stopped and no other significant airline picked it up.
The last move by Frontier to pay the handbag if the passengers do not buy flights directly from this airline, its last attempt is to direct customers directly to its website.
Air carriers are paid to internet travel sales, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each air ticket sold.
This has enabled all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of doing so through internet travel agencies.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who bought via the Internet travel agency only half a mile within the framework of the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the salary for a mile into 25 per cent of a mile from the road.
So the journey with Frontier is 1000 miles long purchased through the Internet travel agency means the reward of 250 miles.
Customers also allow the company to select its seat in front only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a reliable customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is starting to collapse and lose money.
According to the financial results of the company partner of the Republic Airways Holdings, the markets fell by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The company of the Republic is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier with the sale of this airline.
For the fall of the NSA's website, the hackers are not guilty, but "inside error"
The secret National Security Agency stated last Friday that her website for several hours last week was due to internal failure, not to the attack of hackers, as some have claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA's pages were not accessible this evening for a number of hours due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates," the Spanish agency stated in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the accident was caused by the DDoS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online servers recorded that NSA websites did not work for at least six hours, and sites are still unavailable for some users.
Former NSA spokesman ABC News reported that the internal network of sensitive agencies was not "at all" threatened.
The speaker said that no hidden information was compromised.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for eradicating NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until servers cross and the site falls.
This cybernetic tactics is relatively simple and the purpose of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secretary agency, which once received the nickname No such agency, has become a result of the discovery of foreign and domestic surveillance programmes in the past months, with the public attention and criticism of the fact that, in general, the product of removing NSA secret files from the agency and expressing them to the disappointed former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that the accident today was the result of a targeted cybernetic operation.
The profit of Bombardier fell as a result of the decrease in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier reported on Thursday a 15 % decrease in net profit due to smaller orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
The company Bombardier also did not disclose any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft in Montreal, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft would comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half of the plane flew only three times and a question arose as to whether the test phase was going well.
The results did not meet the estimates and the stock exchange in Toronto declined by 8 percent.
The State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced on Thursday's rating from "high performance" to "the performance of the sector" with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"The smaller deliveries of aircraft we expected most, the profit range in the area of transport has greatly disappointed us," Doerksen told the customers in the report.
As the pilot program continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries aircraft orders.
However, if no new orders will be notified in the coming months, we assume that the market growth towards this programme will increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will enter the sub-area of the market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March and the first flight took place after a few months of delay in September.
However, the number of mandatory orders of CSeries is limited to 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the pilot flight to verify the company's claim of low consumption and savings at the cost of this aircraft.
At present, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 mandatory orders when placing the first aircraft for commercial use.
The leaders also assured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme is in line with the plan.
"The test aircraft didn't stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call and noted that the ground tests and software updates were planned at the time of the flight's departure.
Every producer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate the first year and then focus on updating, and we did.
It's gonna happen during the entire flight schedule.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test planes should be taken away in the coming weeks and the other shortly thereafter.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating a CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier argues that it has assessed its plan to deploy the aircraft and will provide updated information in the following months.
“This slow pace of summer tests – although in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to strengthen our view that the introduction will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
Of the 172 million USD or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier fell to 147 million USD or 8 cents per share in the third quarter at the end of September 30.
Adjusted outputs for one share remained unchanged for 9 cents.
The trend has decreased marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters analysts expected the profit of 10 cents per share and turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that he only added 45 aircraft to 57 aircraft a year earlier during that quarter.
Clear orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The outstanding contracts in the air division amounted to 32.9 billion by 30 September, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our prospects, but the low income of the order and the overall state of the market disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
The revenues in the aviation industry decreased by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that the income in this division increased by almost 11 per cent to US$ 2.1 billion.
Failure to comply with the transport contracts resulted in a marginal growth of 32.6 billion by 30 September, which was against 31 December.
The distribution of profits in the transport division has been affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The leaders indicated that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock, which also announced the arrival of the financial director of Google Patrick Pichette, dropped by 8.5 per cent on Thursday afternoon during trading at 4.83 USD.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor of Bombardier, announced a 10 % decrease in quarterly profit on Thursday.
The lawyer, who was addicted to cocaine, who warned the mafia before the police investigation, is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to transmit the information to King Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would emerge.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The police officer who informed the mob about the major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had to pass on sensitive information to the chief of the world of Neil Scarbrough after becoming suspected of cocaine use.
A lawyer whose nickname was "Bash" (party) who was criminally celebrated as the best legal representative was arrested at home in 2011.
The police watched Sarborough (32), leaving at the lawhouse in Blackburn in Lancashire, which was just for dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society, three bags of cocaine.
Based on the tests where cocaine was found in his hair, his money and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men for the benefit of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were then monitored during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After the police detained heroin and cocaine in a series of seizures worth GBP 1.5 million with GBP 200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) provided information to the criminals, fearing that it would be dependent on cocaine.
Today Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors' legal company based in Blackburn, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases after a three-week census.
During his previous hearing, he admitted to holding cocaine.
The lawyer was born after a police investigation in Scarborough found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and watched him put 60 percent of the drugs clean under the lawyers' basket in the black golf cart.
Next he was Scarborough with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found drugs, and nine conversations were held between the two.
In the court, it was announced that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, money and credit cards and that Ditta was "a regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but he refused to use cocaine, and said that he spoke to a suspect dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation was a "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to get several credit cards out of it, but all of them were detained and his hair samples were taken.
In a police investigation, he said that he was operating both at his home address and at his workplace, and that his clients were visiting him because of his work.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of which he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives know about them.
Procurator Anne Whyte said: “Who else is aware that he must not violate the law than the legal representative in the criminal field.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a legal representative and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the regular relationship of a client lawyer.
The police investigation dreamt how much he could allow them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession of good reputation, but he insulted it.
He got too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Detta refused and declared: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who was not me, and I wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it right away.”
After hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself at the time he started getting drugs from organised criminals."
Its dependence on cocaine has made it hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organised crime groups, which have commissioned him to collect valuable information on police investigations.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and must in public inspire confidence and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide himself behind the plaza of his profession.
The unit for serious and organised crime in Lancashire led to Mr. Ditt's investigation, on the basis of which he was also sentenced to three cases of cocaine detention and now to prevent the execution of justice, which demonstrates our obligation to bring the criminals before the court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of collaborating for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta arranged an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream work would be lawful to represent clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner he would wish Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for work he would introduce inequality.
He was discussing the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal sent against Babish.
The people were elected by fourteen Members, which means only a third of the number of social Democrats or representatives of the United Nations.
But they enter into a government agreement with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to guess the drawings of possible coalitions, Jana Kasala - a man who made the conditions for government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrei Babish don't have such a matador on their side.
It will probably be remembered this time for the first negotiation in 1992 when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experience was minimal then," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenya's press is blocked by controversial media law
"It's a scary report and it's on site to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply not breaking the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper quoted the bill as anti-constitutional.
"This law is harsh and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most unrecognised independent advertising stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be supposed because it is extended by the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Keni's position in the world economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star Journal, the bill actually transmits "full control over the media" to the government, and Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "has kept a strong wound" and criticises the bill as "close".
The adoption of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by the Islamic shooter at the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media returned the anger of the authorities by sending a security camera to which soldiers allegedly needed to trade in luxury goods instead of attacking.
The police director responded by having two journalists and a media officer called for an interview, but the interview was later downloaded after the press pressure.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be encouraged by up to 20 million Kenyan Shillings and individual journalists to one million together with the risk of "exclusion from the list" or can be denied official press accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to entertain the property of the debtor if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is also one pity enough to eliminate most of the broadcasting stations”.
It is also noted that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that when they silence the media, they can do without fear what they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote National Mutum Mathiu newspaper and described Kenya's media as the key source of the system of mutual control and export in public life.
"When we leave it in politics, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya were in the past criticizing the public.
In May, they voted for the abolition of cuts by the National Wage Agency and for the renewal of their fat salaries of around 532,000 untaxed silks per month, which is the highest in the world.
He's got to burn himself, young Czechs know.
Most of them don't even know what interest
More and more Czechs give their money to the side.
However, they don't belong to the champions in the region.
The most money by the side is stored by the Rakušan, which burns monthly on average 181 euros.
About something more than the Czechs burn people in Slovakia.
This results from the Erste Savings Barometer study in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the audience's mood is improving, and two thirds of the respondents are planning to give themselves more money.
While the Czechs are close to the middle of the guard’s ladder, in Romania and Serbia, people still consume very little.
For example, almost every other Serb will burn the house under the pillow, according to the survey.
In Germany this year, the number of those who spend a month on higher amounts has risen.
Last year, every month, every month for the most diverse type of spores, a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 percent respondents, this year it's five percent more.
The average monthly investment compared to the year fell slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit between combustion products is pension insurance.
This accounts for 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to assess savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the other hand, the structure of the construction project decreased, and the investment funds were also significantly lost last year.
You're only using 16 percent of the respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The study also showed that although people consider it important to burn, most of them do not know the results of individual products.
Especially young people under 30 don't know how their money is paid.
On the contrary, the best knowledge of the effectiveness of its savings has the oldest group of respondents, amongst people over 50 years of age, 73 percent of those surveyed.
In the international comparison of the Erste Česi group, they lead to the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44 per cent of people.
The following are Slovaks and Rakušan with a 12 per cent discount.
The UN celebrates the new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work immediately on a new set of goals that replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began at night in Rio de Janeiro, the Australian diplomats played a key role in the launch of the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDG, whose validity expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said at the summit that now is the time to "get over national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to establish the overall objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
SDGs will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to achieve our vision of the objectives of sustainable development, which builds on the success of the MDG.
Mozambique's security concerns are escalating because of the conflict of strong personalities
Under the Sochoa Samory Makely, the Mosambian President of the Founder, thousands of people met in the center of Maputa in order to practice peace passwords on rare public demonstrations.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Out of fear of the future of its country, the company changed its clothes for a shirt decorated with the title "we demand security" in Portuguese and joined the mayor's office of independence on Thursday.
After two weeks, reports of conflicts between the government and the party of Renamo, about one of the worst flows from the peace agreement more than 20 years ago came.
Renamo was once an unrecognizable rebel, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then the government of the apartheid in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt again in the country, but recent events have prompted foreign investors and locals.
The economy is fast growing, as the discovery of extensive coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the north-west can be brought by companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and the American Anadark, over $50 billion investment.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension that has arisen.
The Renamo party claims that the government caused the last conflicts by initiating an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional village of the Renamo Party.
The violent attacks of the former rebels resulted in the attack by government forces at the base of Renamo and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, for the Financial Times spokespersons of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is accusing Renamo of launching the conflicts, because it was attacked by soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza was trying to alleviate the fears of instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office AFP said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "consistency", who wanted to use "everything that remained of his strength to try to prove that the government could order its own decision".
Like Frelimo, Renamo claims they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew when Mr. Mazangy was quoted as saying that the Renamo party was derogating from the 1992 peace agreement.
The letter from FT said that he thought the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous talks between these parties have done little to mitigate the tensions between these parties, which have stirred up a number of currents this year.
It is a charm between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), the lecturer at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon said.
Neither is one of them a good negotiator, nor is one of them ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has tried to change the election, has already expressed itself that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort to obtain from the government benefits and financial gains.
The electoral share of Renamo since 1992 is decreasing, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza – whose second functional period ends next year – wants to destroy democracy in this country.
"The democratic system does not want more sides, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace because it does not want to leave the presidential authority," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but he has carried out repulsive terrorist attacks at the police station and on vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most of the traffic occurred in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira is, a port on which the companies rely, including Rio Tinto and Vale, when they export coal.
In June, Rio stopped for about a week using the railway when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to comment on the question of whether Renamo was repeating his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent kidnapping.
"People think that the responsibility for the country's future lies exclusively with the government and the president and that he should be the one who will find a solution to the problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuan says people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, want free access to the road," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for the way of life”, says the author.
The stories about Thora can show that "a rough force cannot equal smart estivities", while artush's legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Most of the myths would be "too wild for school education, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscenistic," said Crossley-Holland, who is referring to a careful choice of age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been planning this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are in the habitual story with “encouragement” message for children as “switcher”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated from English the bishop of Beowulf and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Barriers, says: "You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you leave them for yourself."
Perhaps the greatest difference between adult author writing for adults and adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end with a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be aware; revealed through the story, not openly defined.
The old truth is it's better to show than to describe.
Brno Star will take visitors to the universe in a new digit
At first sight, it is obvious that the large planetary room has changed in the last half of the year.
Here is a new sight, visitors can hide in new comfortable seats and above their heads came the projection area of an average of 17 meters in the form of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is his most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To be a perfect picture, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the hall.
"It's about twenty computers that generate images," said the director of the Brno Star Hall Jiří Dušek.
Computers will make sure that the image from several projectors is not covered, but gave a perfect impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty-four times higher than that of classical personal computers," said the star technician Tomáš Hladík.
The digitalium can be an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The viewers look so bright right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
Star management plans to predict purchased order and its own design in the room.
They've been on the show since Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People in it will learn about the training of cosmonauts, fly into space, trap themselves on the centrifuge, and then see in the brief examples how the conditions of astronauts in the space of the head are demanding.
The second show is for children and has the name Kauoka'hina.
He will tell the story of Utse, whose pestro-colored inhabitants lived a calm life until the blast of a nearby pine.
The entire digitalium stood at about fifty million crowns, which were paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the star from its budget also contributed a small amount.
The projection area was ten million crowns, the projector of twelve million.
"The rest of society's audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the star passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've been studying 11 people!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 advertisements offering jobs, 4300 of which were published in the daily press and 6800 advertisements (62%) online.
The Internet thus becomes the most important media for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the first research was carried out, it accounted for 26 per cent.
In the last two investigations (2007), approximately 60 percent were established.
Indications of job opportunities in themselves, according to the analysis, reflect the current situation on the labour market.
An example may be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during the economic prosperity period and during the economic crisis.
For example, almost 25 900 ads were published in the same follow-up period in 2007, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is geared towards a narrower, especially a more qualified group of professionals.
On the contrary, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those in the workforce, the author of the analysis Pavlín Šzęstnová.
The representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the front posts of the advertisements sought by managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts were impressed.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In today’s press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, rather than large representations are particularly formal and professional professions.
Of course, the most frequently mentioned requirements expressed by employers through the advertising offer are education.
Another area was the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In today’s press, a requirement for the knowledge of a foreign language was made in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In just two percent of advertisements, employers demanded the active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer gravity' were found in 40 percent of advertisements (in the daily print in 11 percent, on the internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Practice requirements are all linked to qualified professions.
It is particularly about leading production and other leading workers.
In the field of engineering, in particular, it concerns mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and food processors or the repairers of electrical equipment, the author of the Jirí Tillner study added.
Employers shall also specify, in half of their advertisements, the requirements for the characteristics and skills of the beneficiaries.
The most frequently required skills in the first-place fire have already shown communication skills for a long time.
In addition, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: New Yorker's Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival
It could be argued that New York City is the place where a solo comic show was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the various artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the assembled people jokes by method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, more recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – with more than sixty performances in small clubs and big theatres.
“Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they were too large to play in the club,” said Hirschová.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes", the annual musical comedy performance at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will take place.
Just as this festival expanded, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comics from the festival this year came from non-traditional channels, such as show in smaller broadcasts or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll grew up with his seat (vessel picantní "League" on the fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at the Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live", and "Parks and recreation", but the most popular was the "Marcel the Shell with shoes on" video series.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognizable voices (Urreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, driven, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are a product of a decentralised American comedy world.
One of the biggest players in the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he held a TV Land Show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in Larry's comedy DNA all over," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, there's sometimes a street between the two buildings, and he says, "Man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here.
The oil price went down to $96 a barrel.
The oil price on Friday continued to decline as high stock concerns were exported a report showing the strengthening of the Chinese industry's energy-laundering industry.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries dropped by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European electronic commerce at the New York Stock Exchange in the late morning.
On Thursday, 39 cents were reduced and 5.8 percent remained for October.
The rich oil resources in the last few weeks made the price difficult.
The Ministry of Energy announced on Wednesday that US stockpiles have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, the stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production led to a greater demand that showed growth in activity.
This means that China's economic recovery could continue to increase after growth, which had risen to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter of the previous two weak decades.
Oil Brent, an international oil indicator used also by the American refinery, fell at the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents for $108.58 per barrel.
Not at all, Mr. Haske.
We have the only way to show the politicians that they are not.
It is necessary to develop such pressure that Martin Hasek has been released from all political functions and has left the MP's mandate.
Any other solution reduces the level of political culture, which is already so cool.
Martin Hasek is protected by the promise he made, but each and every policy must in particular be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what he can promise.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr. Babi has the important one, of course it is the question whether it is politics).
The better program pursued by a liar is unbelievable.
He's not sorry about politics, he's retreating to politics.
Mr. Hašku, if you think this is good with this country (and your frequent statements in it define me, if you just didn't - here you see how it is lying), leave politics alone, as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and takes responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be considered as helpless weak ones, whose words and deeds cannot be trusted.
You want to be proud, be a missing person or a life shadow.
It may seem to you that he is unjust when I speak to you only, but you are a leader and they are only a lost sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to close your ears for a moment, reassess your strengths, dissipate the shame and then attack again, but that's how the partisans or subversives behave.
You're, I repeat, in my eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court blocked the regulation concerning the procedure for the arrest and search of persons by the police department in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the judicial regulation requiring changes in the arrest and search programme for persons in the police department in New York and the court dismissed the case.
The second U.S. appeal court said that the decision of Judge Shiry Schendlin would be postponed until the decision on the appeal that the city gave.
In August, the judge decided that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its programme of stopping and questioning people.
The city of its conclusion and its regulatory regulation was designed, including a decision to assign oversight, which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training programme.
The appeal court heard arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said that the court had to be dismissed from the case because it had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge and that, as a judge, it did not act as a court to avoid the opinion of the firm, partly because of a series of media talks and a public declaration which it openly reacted to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly focused on blacks and Hispance in their detention and search program.
She established independent oversight to monitor major changes including procedural, training and oversight reforms, and ordered the launch of the pilot programme for the purpose of testing cameras carried on the body in some areas where the most frequent arrest occurs.
In August, New York agreed to terminate the storage method of names and addresses of people whose cases were refused after the police investigation.
The oral reasons for the withdrawal of the city are sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching persons have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
In some forms there has been stopping and searching for people for about a decade, but the observed visits under the management of the independent old-age Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases it was black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of them among the minorities, were registered as a complaint which became the case of a group complaint.
The founders of the change in the stopping and search programme by the NY police department claim that the change will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police body and may influence how these procedures are used by the other police department.
The opponents claim that the changes reduce police morale, but not crime, and that money is being wasted, but that they do not solve a wider problem when the police force is under pressure after the last decade has reduced its numbers by a few thousand.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching for persons who were constitutional, but reformed the way police department visited the NY.
Five shopping centers are dealing with low visits
It comes from the data of real consulting companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague Bohnicas, the public opens the Krakov Business Centre, will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
In the Czech Republic, there are now a total of 90 major shopping centres.
The unsatisfied performance is about 20 percent of the medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large center towards locality and bad layout, so too much pattern or complicated and unrecognizable organisation of passports, possibly dead places centre," Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield said.
Also, according to the leading retail property department Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five malls are dealing with low visitors.
Among the main reasons are poor transport availability, low income category of local residents or market overcapacity in the place.
Some of the projects were almost completely covered, but their results were largely unsatisfactory at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and dislike to change their shopping habits.
The new business centre must try harder to "sweet" its customers on new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing activities," added Samadi.
According to Sotáka, the size of shopping centres is generally stable, even at some centres, because the tenants were willing to lower the rent and hire some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully contained and that the average size is reduced in this way (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouci)," Soták added.
The shopping centres opened in the last two years are taking place on the market according to Sylvie Samadi very slowly.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the people of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, called 'convinence centres', aimed at purchases and services of daily needs for residents living in the immediate environment," Samadi said.
According to Sotáka, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
And for the small 'service' centre, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Citys such as Kladno, Czech Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, you can see the space for the prepared shopping centre at the Winning Square, and then you can see the clear potential of the street Na Příkopě and Václav Square.
"The expansion of retail parks that allow traders to cover and expand to smaller cities for favourable rental and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, as well as their reconstructions such as the reconstruction of business houses Prior, which are looking for a good location," Dita Kubánková from DTZ added.
In the Czech Republic, 90 modern shopping centres are currently located with a total of more than 2.2 million meters of square-threshold rental areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, are derived from the data of Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is on the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, leaving the Czech Republic about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson broke into the phone to check his tip
The former editor of news news of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods "to get on the phone, to monitor and confront" to confirm the subversive type of loving relationship that the then Minister of Interior Charles Clarke had to engage in.
State Representative Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey Court said that the news of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive Special Adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The news was entrusted to private investigator Glenn Mulcairea to get into the Pawlby's voice box and penetrated into her private, but the court found that Coulson had called her and left her voicemails.
"The State Representative indicates that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person standing in front of the house and hoping that people will be caught outside, but a person who likes to hear stories to see what they say," said Edis.
He said that the NotW newspapers used three ways of exploring stories: getting on the phone, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Of course he knows about the second, tracking, he needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does she know about getting on the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
The stories about the loving relationship that Clarke was involved with were first captured by the News News Department, when the source, who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby, was said, "You're wasting your time, that's Charles."
A record of the voice reports received from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at the Mulcair house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records in the computer of the private investigator, where Mrs Pawlby and her sister were named "Projects".
During the time of Mrs. Paulby's investigation, her cousins received anonymous phone calls requesting information about Paulby, said Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were watching Mrs. Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on 18 June 2005 saying, "I got a story that we're going to publish tomorrow and which I'd like to talk to Charles very much about."
Mr. Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in the story was based on the same model as in other important personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday's trial, it was announced that Coulson was confronting Mr. Blancett for a loving relationship with a married woman, while he himself met with her husband, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks opposed contact with other people for the purpose of calling from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have confessed to getting on the phone.
The detection of NSA increases the social monitoring paranoia by the State
One day at the end of August, the German police helicopter was running over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the main city of the German economy.
The purpose of the mission was to arrange a photograph of the cover of the US-led surveillance, which is less than 5 km away from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media argues that BfV hopes that it will be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action has allowed in Berlin an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers.
James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, once again claimed in September that the United States did not use its foreign reporting options, "to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, who became a co-worker as an informer, has begun to discover his valuable collection from the United States, the European government, and the leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they are to believe in the words of the director.
According to reports that the US National Security Agency carried out espionage in the Brazilian oil company and had access to data available by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, there was a general paranoia about State monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop revealed that Angela Merkel's office phone might have been listened to for ten years.
If it can be the most powerful target in Europe, then it is certainly a potential target for front entrepreneurs.
Snowden reviewed intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that with regard to industrial espionage and data theft, the US is now at the same high risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the whole of the dossiers that Mr Snowden has so far been submitted by the United States to its own companies by trade secrets.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and have stated that it should try to limit its dependence on the USA:
The front entrepreneurs are skeptical about this.
The German Parliament calls for the votes that we should produce the German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany comes from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical complexity of the American spy agencies discovered by Snowden is still shocking for some companies who have previously thought that China is the greatest threat to monitoring.
It is becoming a major turning point in cloud computing technology, where European representatives have widely realized that data stored in the United States fall under that jurisdiction and are therefore potentially insurmountable.
According to a survey carried out by the Trade Community Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of the non-American members after the US Prism programme was discovered have cancelled plans to use a cloud provider based in the United States.
Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, says: "We have a new question for customers who were not here a year ago - where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high-level actors argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to clear their most valuable secrets and that data must be protected at any price.
That economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always been done.
"It has been a key topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director General of BASF Agrochemicals.
The Americans are carrying out espionage at the commercial and industrial level, just as we are carrying out espionage on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Entrepreneurship generally does not want to be covered by countermeasures that have made it impossible for the attacker to benefit accordingly.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive or leaving unprotected notebook in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s car show, says that for many years it has been a practice to collect before a mobile phone show so that it can not be used as a listening device.
The German BfV Office advises the leading workers to consider whether to use a simple prepaid mobile phone on foreign routes because of the risk that smart phones can be denied.
The prepaid mobile phones will then be fired.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies in their specific areas are the leading representatives of the global market.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access," BfV cautions in its report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage from other countries.
According to Washington Post, National Intelligence Estimate reported that in February France, alongside Russia and Israel, another number of perpetrators involved in the hacker activity for economic reporting, which is now behind China.
A member of the Council in a German risk-free society concluded that, as far as economic espionage is concerned, "the worst French are".
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, said this month in one of the talks: “The services know very well that all countries, while working together in the fight against terrorism, carry out espionage on their alliances.”
The parents of an unfavourable boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an unfavourable boy from Georgia whose body was found inside the poisoned game spirit in his gymnastics school believe that their son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Valdosta in Georgia was found on January 11 in the middle of the halls of the gymnasium where he went.
The sheriff's investigators from Lowdes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old refuses to do so.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it resists logic, physical laws and also healthy sense," Crump said.
They feel that it should cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back to touch them with corpses," he said.
State representative Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unresponsible.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
announced Moore at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep track of the fact that they're going to tell me anywhere.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for regular investigation," he said.
Moore told the reporters that the original drink meant that Johnson died as a result of "suspension".
The second drink, however, according to Moore, introduced another cause of death.
"There are several questionnaires to be answered or confirmed here," he said.
Moore added that if, in the case of Johnson's death, he reveals enough evidence for an order to investigate a criminal offence or violation of civil rights, he shall request the FBI and its enforcement.
The deputy sheriff's office from the county of Lowdes was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
A judge from South Georgia in the middle of the offices ordered that all videos from the surveillance cameras be made available to the investigators.
The parents of the youth hope that the video footage will contain a lead to the discovery of their son’s death.
The CDC Centre issued guidelines on child allergy for schools
In the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a package of guidelines has been issued to help with children's allergies to food at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergy is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
The CDC Centre found that food allergy in children rose by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
For schools, the guidelines contain information on how the teacher congregation and staff should be aware of children's allergies to food and how to react to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline – the most frequently used automatic injector of EpiPen – to be able to react to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State law authorities have recently updated the rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that occur in conversations with children who have allergic reactions.
The child can say, “It’s like someone’s touching my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hairy tongue” or, “I know my tongue.”
Parents of intersexual children can choose “uncertain sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an inconclusive sexual arrangement.
Newborn children will no longer be appointed only to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to introduce any sex for such children, and allows them to introduce sex as "unspecified" or "unspecified" on their family lists.
The aim of the law is to stop pressure on parents so that their child will be surprised to decide for the purpose of determining sex, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersexual.
According to the BBC, one intersexual person said after many years, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm gonna stay a slatanine-created doctor, brainwashed and decomposed.
It is estimated that every year since 2000, children are born one that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of the group of about 60 realities that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorder, disrupting the term for those with atypical chromosomes, sexual glands (occupational or vertebral) or unusually developed genitalia.
The intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
The definition of sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and to determine it instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until surgery is carried out.
New York Psychiatr Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-specific issues, said that the new German law "seemed like a good thing".
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemmas.
"Some people are in a dangerous situation in life that requires surgery, but most children don't," he said.
Gender determination can be carried out without surgery and can then wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of how a child develops sexuality is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery, why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex but to their biological structure, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as one of them.
These drawings may appear in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, pruritus and character, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual instruments, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination enjoyed by inter-sexual and trans-sexual workers, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't respond to any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to identify in official documents male, female or "third sex".
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "free" person in June when she won the court's appeal so that she could leave the status of "uncertain" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, there will be German passports other than M (male) and F (female) and third name, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to the report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011 dozens of French legislators from this highly Catholic country signed petitions for the removal of "the theory of sex" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic website on-line also came across the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state, when sex is a question of choice, but sexual activity is not the same, we reverse the edges of two other pillars of civilization.”
One mother of Maryland's newborns also said about the baby's zone that she would rather see children to have sex at birth.
"Family alone is stressful without any other restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she said to the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, according to the prominent river that had two sexes.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a table that can be erased and re-overcrowded.
But now many doubt the ethical basis of the operation that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes decide wrong because they don't know how their sex will make them feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
Persistent theory of how to treat children with gender mismatches was presented by Dr. John Money at the University of Johnse Hopkins, who held the view that sex is susceptible.
He created a new concept of " sexuality" and argued that social causes and the environment – as parents raised their child – influenced the genes and hormones of children and created a child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/John", his theory became controversial.
The parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged by a miscarriage, recommended that their child be left to be completely expelled, removed, and brought up as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of change, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he had to rearm the boy and marry his wife.
But in 38 years, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "use this model" today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, survivors of these operations became "discontent with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but an inconspicuous sexual arrangement.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfying life”.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the external organs and vertebrates and was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones in 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
In 18 he was sent to the burying plant.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrible.
After my birth, I was sterilized and nobody ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its sexual organs.
After learning the truth, he turned to men, took the doses of testosterone, and let the syringes be removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in the organisation called Interface Project and tries to normalise the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Legal Group Advocates for informed choice (responsibles of informed elections) is concerned that the German law "calls for cicadas and stigmats".
“Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose “uncertain” child,” she said.
We're afraid it's going to make an intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex".
"Adequate people should be able to make their own decision on the legal sex," she said.
The German law is about to allocate it at birth.
It's a battle a little kid shouldn't have had right now.
When they grow up, they can make their own decision about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh chest radio, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in a supportive group, said that the German law "gives authority" to both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgen intolerance syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are contagious, they developed in Katie's female drawings.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a factory and eggs.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and works as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement motherhood.
"The law gives parents a certain space so that they do not rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to carry out certain tests and to think about them and gives them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child and you're happy about it.
You don't have to hurry with an operation that's irrevocable.
"It makes it possible to involve both the child and the anxiety that parents are having because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he is more consistent with – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drinker ate the whole house with gasoline: he threatened to burn it even with his own family!
The tension increased, the fear was escalating.
The man started threatening to burn the whole house.
Instead, all available police guards in the area, as well as a unit of firemen from Mladé Boleslav and a unit of voluntary firemen.
A police negotiator came to the scene, who tried to express his irrational behavior.
The man kept threatening to burn the house.
That's how she had to get into the house by an intervention unit that destroyed and destroyed men.
The attacker then ended his investigation at the juvenile hospital, where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic arrest facility.
After all, the Hassicians slept in the house with petrol, a sorbent that they later cleaned up.
In addition, all pets were saved from the house.
He didn't give a man to the police negotiator, so the command came after him.
Report: Obama's campaign considered changing Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisor to President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in 2012.
This discovery is the most important sensational book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemanna "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine received a copy of the books coming in and announced Thursday evening that the president of the top collaborators had arranged an intensive group meeting and research at the end of 2011, to determine whether Bidena's release would help bring Obama's hope of a re-election to life.
According to a national-political writer for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of leading officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former White House Manager Bill Daley, to measure the impact of the move on elections by former foreign ministers to the post of Vice-President Clinton.
The potential change has been a very close secret within the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and inside the Oval workshop.
Only a few of the next president's closest advisers, including Daley, the former head of Obama's campaign Jim Messin and former chief advisers at the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was the representative of the attempt to replace Biden despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not significantly increase the odds.
In his interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering Biden Clinton's replacement.
"I have studied a lot of things intensively, and this was one of them," Daley said.
You can't forget that the president had a terrible view back then, so we said, "Christian, what are we going to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "the proper care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of the CNN that the campaign for re-election had made small investments to see if this would be paid out in elections.
"There is no such money for elections and qualitative research during the campaigns, if something really is not considered," Martin said to AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told the CNN that Daley was wondering if his then boss knew about this potential car crash.
While Daley said he didn't think that the president was "scientific", the former head office admitted that it was "possible", that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book Double Down definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama at the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama didn't know about the research on the expulsion of Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first ice cream that shines in the dark – for the use of medusa.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous palm tree.
He came up with the idea when he read a professional medusa deal, and convinced scientists in China to make chemicals that cause light-emitting.
This freeze reacts with the language of consumption – increases pH in the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice shines when he reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and that's why the more you lie, the brighter the snow.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious", says: "It's a wonderful substance, but as far as production is concerned, we're at the beginning, so you'll get about 2 g of this substance for GBP 200."
The protein we use in the freezer reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats protein, the pH increases, and the freeze starts to burn.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween, because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice that I've ever made, because the lighting of medusa is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every pile of me stands at about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its non-traditional taste of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
His next product should be even more ambitious.
He says, ‘Indeed I wish I had produced an invisible frost.’
In fact, it's impossible because of the tear of the light caused by the ice crystals that freeze, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
Ice cream uses fluorescence properties of medusa, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By number
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
We could eat sweets with our sister, stay up for a long time and introduce the neighbors to the clothes.
Today, I feel like I've become a caretaker.
After two years, there was no sugar in my apartment, and this year it probably won't be different.
However, the statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, the black sheep.
According to the U.S. Small Business Federation (NRF), Halloween will be celebrated this year by most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and will spend a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations.
What I'm looking forward to every Halloween is trendy.
According to the NRF, $ 6.9 billion of lost dollars is expected to go 1.2 billion on costumes.
This year they are the last shot of fashion sexy non-living objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy can be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as man is concerned, I expect us to see a lot of zombies through the passage of the dead, and I bet that the Space Man from Daft Punk will reach our channels in Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones to my breath.
In fact, according to the NRF, the American spends $330 million on animal pet costumes this year.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
As far as sweetness is concerned, we're not wasting our time.
According to Nielsen U.S.A., $1.9 billion is lost.
It's about 300 million kg of Hershey, lice, sweet milk duds and Twizzlers and Clark's ink.
It's a wonderful report for 41 million colleges who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to break down our quarter.
In fact, we're going to buy during Halloween, and believe it or not, we're going to consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn beans, and yet according to the National Association of Sugars around Halloween sells nearly 16,000 tons.
That's about 9 billion individual corn beans.
It's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror beyond the walls" (Horze behind the wall, which is, by the way, a real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" (jekot, rav) and "The house of shock" (The House of Shock).
In fact, there are in the United States, officially dedicated 1200 horrific homes that, according to the American horrific home, earn $500 million, and that includes the amazing photos that you're in fear of and that give your friend on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like, will look at the picture and write a comment like "You look pretty".
And finally, there's a little bit of a dance.
By the time we were young, Charlie Brown introduced us a great day (Great Pumpkin) and cutting the day's lighthouse is kind of like making a Christmas tree – we're doing it from a little bit.
Luckily for us the trend "child in the day" started thanks to Pinterest only last year, so most of us grew up to cut the dick instead of sitting in it.

A series of competitions of Land Rover
The interior has race seats and six-piece safety belts as well as intercoms.
The choice includes improved brakes, service packs providing access to Bowler Works machines, logistics support and vehicle storage between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants in the races that come to Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, as well as an affordable way to world class races.
We are pleased that we can offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various race disciplines in Britain and the sea, and that it will prepare competitors for the toughness and reality of Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defender Challenge car we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
Defender Challenge will also offer a school and testing day in February as well as an opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: Before two years we have a preliminary election here
The president of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects further early elections.
The week after the last conversation for News.cz said that there is no other exit, and every government comes out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is impossible as a blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying that the life span beginning on the election period is estimated to be two years.
With the objection that the next election will be difficult to choose, they do not agree, "I think it will be a little more balanced decision."
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters as this year in other elections (in 2010 approximately 300 thousand votes were cast).
Schwarzenberg estimates that, if it is clear within two months that early elections will take place, it will strengthen the movement of the ANO 2011 Andreje Babis.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi will lose.
The turbulence situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a hidden English meeting of the party's leadership, declared that social democracy would remain either him or Michal Hasek, comments Schwarzenberg:
"The leading officials of the democratic party as small boys go to the head of the state to allow them to turn to the side."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen anything so rudely done in my life," said the president of TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (who shot himself in the fight on the presidential function) he said, "The role of the state's head is clear: he wants to strengthen the party."
The first laws have already been tabled by TOP 09.
What was your personal surprise?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in November, including the Paris Register of Treaties, which had been discussed before the elections by the Snow Committees, but with the early elections he fell under the table.
The president of TOP 09 in the conversation for Current.cz claims that such a speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, TOP 09 wants to clearly anticipate similar attempts on the other side.
For example, the ANO election leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election battle of introducing the "fraud" program of the ANO.
TOP 09 has now used the jump - it is just a proposal that had already been made to the second recording reading.
The Hasian units came to rescue the lost dog, which hung 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous stone mine.
Kidney Ruby ran away after a little car accident.
Three days later, the man who was imprisoned in the Stone Age was arrested by the man who had married the dog.
The Hassicians went down the rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The shield was released by fire units that came to release it after somehow stuck itself on a dangerous base in the 15 - foot - above - ground stone.
The nine-month-old kid Ruby ran off after a little car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days on his own until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson (25) and his friend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit Stone in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he ran away when he got into a small accident, a fever followed his lost dog and put challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, at 2:15 p.m., a white dog caught Ruby on a cliff 15 meters above the ground.
Instead, he rushed a technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station and jumped down to free Ruby, using him to pick up the transport bag for the animals.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team expert, said that the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was directly in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
When he was saved, he did not move his neck – he was totally frozen.
But now he's okay.
Then he got the cookies.
It was a very unusual ride.
The fact that the dog has been seen is incredible.
The expert chief of the technical rescue team Peter Lau said: "Ruby had great happiness during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet at the checkpoint, and besides the exhausting and dehydration was okay.
Ms. Hallová, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was afraid of the rescue."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The vet said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The Hassicians have done a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The masks were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't get out.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004 were accompanied vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went out after her.
She said, “It was a long time ago, and now she is very kind to me.”
In a statement from Jagger's (70) vice-president, he said he categorically denied that he would ever make Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe you're messing with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (songwriters) who appeared this year on the Rolling Stones concert track.
Her new album "Prism" debuted this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe Gives Scotland a Choice
Next day, another horrendous story about independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for independent Scotland's membership in the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This led to stories of passport controls in Berwick and the rest of the way along Hadrian's wall.
The truth is that Strathclyde's newspapers mentioned the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not happen to the headlines.
No one has mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they do.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, a continuing supply of dissatisfaction would be a financial contribution to Brussels for anything they really want from Scotland.
So it's a pretty bad story.
And also so old that it became an exhumation. I hear that "independence means passport controls", I heard at least 40 years ago.
However, one interesting thought is concealed in this voodoo talker.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why exchange the London ham for the Brussels hamlet, especially now?
This is a real European story: a great war plan to unite Europe has finally collapsed.
The impact of the euro crisis is officially dead Europe's project.
On the contrary, Europe is influenced by a party dedicated to the EU or by the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came from nowhere and has already used nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, which from the Bundestag is essentially free Democrats (the equivalent of British Liberal Democrats).
On home ground, there was always a resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The resistance dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a dedicated indicator on the national economy through the single currency, has led many people to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments having a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system, which blocks its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of distorting domestic currency, southern Europe has an advantage in the area of domestic production against Germany.
The only means is to cut revenue and public expenditure – to which Germany is asking for it.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are the deeper cause of European retail performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – a code for the support of French and German companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol than it does in the United States.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not all the world's ice cream would reverse the sinking of the European petrochemical industry with the cheap breast oil from the United States.
As a result, there is strong resistance, especially in France, when the EU's EU is excited.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that will keep Germany in confidence and enable Paris to build up in the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, no longer needs the political legitimacy of Paris and has advanced its own economic policy in Europe and has left the French economy in its judgment.
Result: The correct wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won the main additional elections and has removed the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front is now with 24% of the most popular vote in France – a timely warning to British Labourers that they cannot judge whether the right to vote automatically appears on the left.
How does Le Pen get his newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The next year's European elections would like to use the European Parliament to create an anti-European bloc against the single currency.
If anti-European parties say good in these elections, which is likely, such a block can be dominated first in the history of the European Parliament.
At the same time, I think that, in due course, the anti-European feeling and attitude towards the common currency will be combined and the euro will be lost.
The EU does not disappear, but the transformation is more free in the sense of "European (Sovereign) nations", General de Gaulle has already given priority.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may leave the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect Great Britain to distance from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington's increased interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where's Scotland going?
We can choose to be a region (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this is also an opportunity to announce to Berlin and Brussels when we are to be left behind.
I assume that Scotland would do well in the relaxed organisation of Europe, assuming it would preserve its own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries would be easier in the Non-Federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and leave our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – the most successful political move that has not been successful in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011 due to the opposition to the cuts planned (and implemented) by the Labour Office Alistair Darling and the following coalitions of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland had now chosen independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Temporary Puberty: Advanced Before
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white levels.
Physical changes don't mean they're getting close to puberty.
It has not been shown that there are hormones or other chemicals
Experts claim that an epidemic of obesity may be one of the triggers of earlier puberty.
The trend of previous puberty is not so fair with boys.
The former CNN rapporteur Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be afraid when her daughters begin to grow breast and fatten in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Child Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time making sure my parents that it was not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, swelling of shame and in the backbone and body smell, appear earlier in the girl.
In the last forty years, however, there was only a small shift in the age of the first menstrual period.
In the United States, the average age is 12,5 years, compared with 12,75 years in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, they will reach at least two to three years before the first menstrual period," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
It is discussed about what triggers the actual beginning of puberty, but if the growth is accompanied by growth spores 8 years ago, the girl is considered to be "priorly mature".
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which can be monitored carefully by children’s doctors.
The faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist to carry out tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay early menstrual periods and prevent further consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to a halting growth and aggravation in adulthood.
The recommendations regarding medicines and hormonal therapy depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
There are also important psychosociological aspects.
With regard to drug use, Kaplowitz is careful, but recognizes that “repression of puberty can alleviate problems with the behavior of the girl and her feelings that differ from her peers”.
Understandably, there is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstrual periods.
"They worry that they can get pregnant, or how they can manage hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have a menstrual period of 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, it wasn't prepared emotionally.
She came from school home scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no related file of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are at fault.
Boys – like girls – get to puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most serious reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study in girls from 6 to 9 years of age who connect body fat with puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white opponents.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, it seems that patterns of early puberty are affected by everything possible from economic conditions across the atmosphere to genes.
Another argument: While in low age boys are exposed to face and shame, the trend towards the full development of early puberty is not as obvious as it is in girls.
Other doctors participating in the conference of the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and swelling of the skin is common even in infants and bats.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real show of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from the Goryebsk Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not weigh their child’s doctor’s instructions on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean talking to the child before you assume,” Kalowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who are developing before need to make sure that even if this happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadja Konvalink in the role of the housekeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Herečka Nadja Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the crack in the role of the household and she was very happy.
That perhaps a favorite Czech actress planned a change in the profession and went to business in the house?
Nadja Konvalink found herself in James Joyce Irish pub and poured a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and it just went away.
The boss even offered me a job and I could live with beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay at what I'm doing to this day, at the heretic," she said with the smile of Konvalink, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the functioning of the Irish household.
"I like Irish beer, and I'm going to put Irish whiskey in there," she said.
Nadi, a long - term friend and colleague of Paul Nový, also appeared at the event.
I'm after death, and in my new life, I can't celebrate.
I've been allowed one beer or one pancake a day, and I'm trying to keep it," the actor added.
Manufacturers of aircraft wishing for a width of seats, are in bets are big orders
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, a dispute arose over the width of the seats in the second class for long-distance flights, which this month led to a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.
The issue of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for the long-term economic class — not exactly the ones that the airlines would normally have preceded, but whose space is the key to the claims for efficiency in the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus has this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says they have to decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine remote aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the course of the 17th to 21st November.
The way in which the latter part of the aircraft is deployed – especially if 9 or 10 seats are next to it – is the basis for economic performance claims on the proposals of new mini-jumbos.
Boeing says that an improved "777X" model transports 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm in each row.
Airbus says the competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats distributed after 9.
Large aircraft often attack each other in technical matters through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now in front of an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to gain an advantage with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what could be when he started a new advertising war, when he showed the financials a video showing three people drawn in the restaurant with the title "Would you like it?"
"Boeing promotes long flights in narrower seats than in regional turbovoltul aircraft," Airbus John Leahh's sales leader said.
As eating habits change, people are bigger, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health data, the average American weight of between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 percent.
According to American medical statistics, the average American has a 100 cm step in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of 50-year-old seats when the average width of the newly baptized aircraft seats was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted a study indicating that the extension of the seat by 2.5 cm improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing the dimensions of the Airbus seat refuses and says it is not in the power of the aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than on the width of the seat.
“It is really about providing air carriers with flexibility and enabling them to carry out things that are convinced they have to do to be successful,” said an expert at the Kent Craver cabin.
They don't want us to dictate to them what they're earning.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For travellers, there is a more basic space for arcs, but for suppliers, it is a growing problem that can affect yields.
In this dispute, the competition in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the next decades is worth at least 700 billion dollars in catalogue prices, enough to raise the language of American and European exports.
As stated in July, the deployment of seats is exactly what triggers the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they reach 20 percent better performance than the leading market representative in this segment in their latest two-engine remote aircraft proposals, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend in part on the comparison of the design of the 777X model with 10 seats in the row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in the row.
The profit in unit costs is, in contrast, weakened by the 10-seat concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to speed up more seats, and make his aircraft more competitive against our products," said Kevin Kenston, who is the guide for the comfort of Airbus passengers for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in line for existing models 777 are in line with the fact that many travelers are for a thicker spread that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"Four-five centimeters wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view of Airbus is a proposal motivated by the threat of model 777," said an expert on the interior of the Mary Kirby cabin, founder and portal editor Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't supply seats, but they offer the airline a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
The air traffic controllers even carry a measuring band with them to check the competition arrangements.
While it is comfortable, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travellers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in line, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
Airbus has recently stressed the need for greater cabin adjustment by offering more seats in the streets in some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unheard, but can be removed from the sales wave of 777X.
The number of HIV infected has exceeded the thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing each year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infections in 50 people, about five years later there were 121 of them, and in 2010 there were 180 of them.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I believe there is no doubt," said the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who has been leading the Prague Light House for patients for years.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country last year from January to September, and there were 176 of them in the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV has been confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
In the Middle East, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian-Sleezian or 116 from Ustek.
The least infected came from the Highlands, there were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people in the past were infected with blood transfusions.
However, since the beginning of the test, more than a quarter of the century, the case has not been found in the Czech Republic.
The HIV virus also gave birth to six children, transferred to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravitation is, but it's looked beautiful, hard experts
A fantastic film from the universe of Gravity sold some time after the premiere in Czech cinema.
In October, he was seen by the Union film distributors of nearly 150 thousand spectators and won over 26 million crowns.
Most image rating reviews positive.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies.
The Lidovky.cz server asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Star and Planetary Brno): I like science-fantastic films that I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The film Gravitation is not exceptional, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
No, but it doesn't mean he'd be bad.
I've enjoyed it a lot.
You can notice Sandra Bullock's hair, which doesn't look like she's in a state of no difficulty.
Hubb's space telescopes and the International Space Stations are moving along significantly different circular lines, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some film viewers calculate the unreal effect and even the entire behavior of fire in the state of ease.
According to the Squads, there would be no such wounds.
The Hrdins in the movie Gravity often get into the collage with different objects and clothes without any major difficulties will hold everything.
The criticism has not been saved.
So the extensive tragedy on the Earth's circular track is, according to some discussionables, unrealistic.
She's also wondering why the doctor was sent to the universe to repair the technique.
People in forums also argue about "unreal" behavior.
It acts like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Starry and Planetary of Prague): I have seen him so far only on a wide plate, but clearly I can say, I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to adhere to the reality accordingly.
"More than the incompatibilities you mentioned, I was affected by the three-time display of a space station with degrading levels of technology (last Chinese)."
"The Chinese will still look better by the end of the decade and it'll probably look better than it's in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (Director of the Astronomical Constitution of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in not breaking physical laws, and so a naturally oriented viewer estimates that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of mobility is quite right, said by the dictionary of physics, as well as the Earth's view of the universe is very realistic, including the thin columns of the atmosphere and polar rays appearing in polar areas.
Incompatibilities will certainly be found in a more detailed study.
For example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of movement of various cosmic garbage on the circular track appears in some scenes to be reversed before it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jíří Štěpán (an employee of the Astronomical Constitution of the Czech Academy of Sciences): Some things the creators contributed to their needs, but no fundamental and in heaven I did not record a fault against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar intent, it is seen that the creators were concerned about the reliability of the events shown.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that Hubbl's space wide view surrounds the orbit of other than the ISS.
As a result, there is a considerable difference in the speed of each other and the rescue operation could not actually go on as shown in the film.
Then, at the moment of the Kowalska (Cloney) and Stones (Bullock), I did not notice that the whole ISS was rotating, so there is no clear source of force operating on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let themselves be released when they are no longer moving towards themselves.
A new nicotine vaccine may take pleasure in smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for life from nicotine dependence.
Other tests have to be carried out before people are tested, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell's medical department in New York says the first signs are good.
"We hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhaust all methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches are overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an undamaged virus that has been prepared to carry genetic information for the creation of anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce the gas flow of these antibodies.
The antibodies follow all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing the chicken from getting nicotine bites.
In the mouse vaccination tests, added nicotine, continued in their normal activity.
But mice that were not vaccinated “relieved,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often that sufficient levels of antibodies were maintained, so they turned out to be expensive and non-practical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because they convert liver cells into factory for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people would be completely safe, they could give themselves to children before they would like to try to taste cigarettes, and that would be the case with nicotine.
However, it would be more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
"They will know that once they start smoking again, because of the nicotinic vaccine, they will have no benefit, and this will help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripody denies that Obeid would have influenced her.
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be examined by the State Committee for the Monitoring of Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the coastal rental policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on the government controlled land.
The Independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its inquiry on Friday to see whether Mr. Obeid was lobbying several state ministers to rent him at Circular Quay, where Obeids owned two restaurants and cafes, renewed without having to participate in the selection process after his expulsion in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obed's hidden interests in these properties, on the basis of the evidence presented on Thursday by the former vice-president of Mr. Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pressed for public tenders.
The tenants were against it, and they also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, we rented for companies in Circular Quay, which brought Obeid's $2.5 million annually, without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a beneficiary of public competition.
He denied, however, that the changes were made at Mr. Obeid's request, which, as Mr. Tripodi has acknowledged, he insisted on a shift in government rent policy.
The review of the IAC calls showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obedem and Mr Tripodim and Mr Steve Dunn, the chief officer who came to the port resort after working under Mr Obedem in the fisheries department.
"Was the purpose of the talks during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policies?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheely Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obed.
Israeli military aircraft attacked a target in Syria, the responsible figure said
Israeli military aircraft hit the target on Thursday night at the Syrian port of Lázikija, confirmed the responsible administrator of the Fox News station.
This responsible actor did not specifically say what was the goal, but said that he was at least one.
The Press Agency Associated Press indicates that the purpose was to launch the SA-125 Russian production missiles.
At least twice a year ago, Israel carried out an air raid on the supply of rockets in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commenter Pečinka spoke in such a way that he could agree with what the President of Stéch was upsetting.
Heitman Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the ČSSD bid still.
The rest of the gentlemen were mainly showing their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is a principled and non-useable, Vice-President Zaorálek has been unable to talk on television as much as possible.
On this basis, I do not see a better chance than to propose ČSSD to the vice-president of the Senate of Gajdóšk, the only one who would not have a starting handkerchief and I think it would take the standard performance.
It's such a good solution that someone in charge will hardly support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and to continue without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdóškova could without fear bring together a minority government with only a blessing from the President of Babi and without people, but with the human health minister of Hovorka, who is actually a trusted social democrat.
This minimum government would have great stability because it would promulgate the right referendum law and thus commit itself to supporting the President of the Uzvit Okamura.
The President Babish would finally make the progress of the tax because he's smart and he'll see that it's not going without her.
The people would not be in trouble, because the Speaker is the bearer of the best that they have, and they would not be in the government otherwise.
The same applies to the UN, even here, would be a valuable minister, but if they do not want to participate in a risky government participation, but they will provide support, too, well.
Let's give the courage to save Gajdöšk!
Foreign workers with visa authorisation may submit a "authority" test
With the government's intention of extending police actions, the "justice" test for foreign workers with visa clearance 457 is considered.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through the criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as the last return for family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers saying that it could harm the Australian neighbours.
“The “vote declaration of “citizens at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant since the links demanded protection of the labour market”, said the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the white working force should be protected – and I would not wonder if anyone in this region has recorded the announcement of this historic artifact.
The discussion article sets out 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday at Sri Lance, where he was one of the officials for feeding people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
Where the “authority” criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether “nomination is eligible for a situation where they are candidates in relation to or personal association with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.”
According to previous experience with companies that planned to sponsor a small number of employees but then employed hundreds of them, businesses may also be required to justify the number of holders of visa 457.
Between the 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who was trying to get asylum, he died suspicious of a heart attack after he arrived this week on an asylum boat on Christmas Island.
A man’s fearless nine - year - old son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by a grown brother who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities and men rushed to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Baron Kramer said the project "will connect Britain together".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that cooperation with the British government was "invigorated" on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train lines between London and West Midlands.
After the phase two will lead a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the National Transport Scotland Transport Office, entrusted HS2 to discover further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects Britain and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the benefit that it brings is huge.
Without that, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also about connection – the UK will be better connected thanks to HS2, 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is for Scotland's good news."
Behind the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “consistently” support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed track has the potential to bring Scotland disproportionate economic benefits, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across the UK."
We are therefore excited to work with the British government to explore the possibility of bringing the high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bringing all the benefits and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government plans as it does.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British ministers during the next year and the joint decision on further steps.
Together with Bart's arrest of inspections and anti-corruption police analysis
Information about the arrest of Vita Barty began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was delivered by the server Prvnízdary.cz.
The MF DNES attacks found that the case was brought to the attention of the General Inspectorate of the Security Councils (GIBS), whose people were to arrest Bartat in the centre of Prague.
It was played in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
However, the inspection shall deal with cases where there are accused policemen, its powers shall also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the anti-corruption police officers is among those arrested - leading analysts and informatics Jan Petržílek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
The spokesperson for the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, refused to comment on the fact that the media has to turn to the GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokesperson, Radka Sandor, did not want to say anything to the case, she referred to the City State Department in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of hidden realities," said Štěpánka Zenklova, spokesman.
Also from this inconvenient reaction, it can be said that the event has taken place, but it is in the cover-up regime that allows the speaker to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer is Oldrich Chudoba.
The media said that Bart was representing "and in this matter", but since it is classified information, Bart's arrest cannot be confirmed or reversed.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest could be related to a former police president, Peter Lessy.
This was done by Bart, together with former VV President Radke John, who was in charge of the interior ministry.
The dispute that led to a heated dispute between Prime Minister Petre Nekzem and VV had to even solve the then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship took on my person.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything," said IDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.
He was officially beaten by Radek John, the real boss of the party, but he was Bart at the time.
The Bart was now running for the vote for the Úsvit movement, and the MP's mandate was just ran away - about 175 votes.
Tomio Okamura's leader said he doesn't even know what he's talking about.
"The life of Bart was one of many candidates many parties to our candidates and, as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Uzvit direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he distanced himself from Bartya Okamura, who before the elections said he had given Bart's space to run for Uzvit, because he helped him solve the problem of the executioners.
Vit Bart met with his former partner, VV Jaroslav Škárko, at the trial in 2012.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Travellers of Australian airlines will still have to shut down their tablets and smart phones during launch and landing, even regardless of changes in the United States, in order to mitigate the regulations regarding these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given the US company space to change its procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the devices remain in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the most important part of the year, but many people are upset that they cannot access their electronic books during the start-up and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but they indicated that they do not have a plan to change their procedures in a short time.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that this notification was being investigated, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA currently does not have any specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in the aircraft’, he said.
This question is covered by rules which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, who has already talked to CASA about extending the use of her board entertainment wi-fi, has accepted the change, but has announced that the decision of the regulatory authority is being taken.
"We would like to welcome if the CASA authority carried out an analysis of the permit to use electronic devices, because we really think that it would improve the experience of customers now that we have (no free board entertainment)," the speaker said.
The company Qantas announced that it would continue to comply with the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this in a hurry," he said.
FAA requirements apply to US airlines.
But we are constantly interested in the development in the regulatory area that can be useful to our travellers, and we are sure to study carefully the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
In the case of air carriers from the United States, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their air park.
Transporters will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, manual baggage programmes and information for passengers.
"As long as the airline confirms its fleet tolerance, the passenger may allow the use of portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones at any altitude of the sea," the FAA said.
In rare cases, the crew shall order the passenger to turn off during the arrival of the device.
The group also recommended that the heavy equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the spare space above the head during take-off and take-off.
With the growing bida of the middle classes, the teachers in Singapore enjoy flowers
Janani Amirthalinga's gold bracelet, ring and earrings is stopped at the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore so that she can pay her daughter for schoolwork.
"We just bought a house with our husband and I gave it all my money," says Mrs. Amithalinga.
Although every month as an administrator receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, says.
The question, in contrast to the areas in Southeast Asia, where household debt is increasing, is that ValueMax, where a woman is carrying out her transaction, has become a third stock exchange in Singapore this week.
The stopping of spices is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The employers in Singapore usually apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, teachers have the advantage that they do not require a person's verification (payment history) or a credit card, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And so, as families feel pressure from rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region turn to parenting.
After five years of potential growth from the global financial crisis and financial loans supported by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to employers to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted increased use of credit in households mainly because of increasing rents as a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of a record with a figure of 80 per cent of GDP, which is an increase of 60 per cent in 2008.
Economics were also alarmed by high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week only came from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued poor exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"It is essential that people with rising costs will try to supplement their income from medium to low [reception scale]," Song Seng Wun, an economist at the CIMB Malaysian bank, said.
Historically high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are holding back their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to change for the money of their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city halls are made of gold.
People say the gold price looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
The largest operator of stalls in Thailand, EasyMoney, has recorded up to 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its stalls in recent months.
Growth in the stocking sector is so large that ValueMax, the operator of branches in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also beyond Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yes Lee Chingová.
The company will finance it using 60 per cent of the 66 million SGD that it received this week at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discontinuity believers have been criticized for high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the institution offers not only lower rates than other believers, but it also does not directly increase debt.
"The customers suspend the items they already own, and the financing of personal property does not increase the debt of the household," he says.
In the company, the foundation of the property is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, there are not just people in the financial pressure among those who use the hostages.
The wealthy people from Singapore also use ValueMax’s sidewalks when they stop the Golden Routes or Rolex watches, and thus can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible dimensions.
"They are rich individuals who need short-term loans for their courageous trades or investments, or small businesses who need help with solving problems in their cash flow," says Ms. Yeahová.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
Savings package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The Federal Government insists that the savings package of $325 million for composting health in Tasmania contain tough conditions that will ensure that the government does not miss out on financial resources.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Australian Federation is "a rapid measure" to reverse the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Financing for four years has been decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with an emergency rescue package that, we believe, solves the specific problems it faces," Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
Further 2,600 operations including orthopaedic operations and operations of the grey reserve will help to eliminate debt.
Money is also available to free clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, better post-operative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are responding to the ideas that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system," said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Ministry stressed that the Government of Tasmania must require a strict reporting and record-keeping regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the Australian bond's money and to inform each month of where additional funds have been spent.
A tripartite committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will not go to anything unless real reform is followed with a view to establishing a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system.
However, he commended the government for its response to his request for accelerated assistance, which he first brought in in the discussions with the President of the Government in early May.
"I believe that the federal relief package can free public health from critical condition," said Wilkie.
According to the Government, these additional procedures chosen will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Speaking Federal Opposition in the area of health Peter Dutton believes that today's declaration is only "aggravation".
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour Government has removed $430 million from our health system," ABC TV said.
You can't have a government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian bond that's spending $300 million, and it turns out it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be issued for higher red tape.
Guillaume Nickaux adapted Denise Diderota's novel, which brings exceptional film production and time creation, but is also more boring than it should be.
They take place in the 1960s in France and tell a grim story about Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to a monastery by his family.
When she wakes up, she enjoys extremely cruel treatment from a punishable mother who is represented and becomes an object of sexual passion for others.
The film will never fall into the laziness or laziness, and that's his problem.
The sacred root of this story leads to the fact that even the spectators will experience torment similar to the wearing of a wedding garment.
Skiareals want to take care of families with children
Syria has destroyed its funds for the production of chemical weapons, the supervisory authority says
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with fuel gas, said the Global Monitoring Committee on Chemical Weapons Thursday, while severe conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where toxic substances are stored, according to the assumptions.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The notice of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came on 1 November,
the time limit set by this organisation, based in The Hague, to destroy or disable the operation of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and machinery for the mixing of chemicals for the purpose of the production of toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this initial phase of destruction in principle is a significant milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy by mid-2014 all the chemical weapons of Damascus.
Destruction of equipment means Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the lady must begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
It is assumed that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including hyperthyroidism and nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when the battles in Safira, which experts speak of as the factory’s headquarters for the production of chemical weapons and supplies, was launched on Thursday, the Syrian observer for human rights in Britain.
A group of activists, who, through the network of activists in Syria, monitored the total number of victims, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
There should be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29 954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Asada, 18 678 military commanders and 187 armed men from Lebanon are to go.
There are also 2,202 government passersbys and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations organization estimated that 100,000 people died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
The Asad units fought in Safira against rebels, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observable on Thursday stated that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fights posed a threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, in the middle of their mission, have to rid Syria of the chemical arsenal in the middle of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with the short term.
A statement from the OPCW Office, which is closely cooperating with the United Nations, said that its team is now "satisfying that it verified – and monitored the destruction – of Syrian-declared basic equipment for production and mixing/filling".
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they finished the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of my fear of security, they were unable to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW authorities stated that the two seats were ‘discharged and ... the items of the chemical weapons programme which it contained were moved to two other declared positions that were checked’, according to Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria agreed on a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I swear by the courage and bravery you displayed in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organization had ever had," said Ahmet Uzumcu's observer director in his comment issued by the OPCW.
Now, in his third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels in civil war stand against themselves, and Asad is ruling with his security forces, who are full members of the Alaivits sect, though Shiite Islam.
With regard to further development, the chief of the Observer Ramí Abdul Rahman said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside the air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Laziki.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the judgment brought against the founder of the Bali bombing
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a bomb attack in Bali in 2002 responded with a strong response to the judgment of the last of the founders who were put before justice and said that Umar Patek should be corrected.
The duck, who spent nearly 10 years running as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for setting up an explosive device that was used in the bomb attack.
In 15 years, he could be released conditionally.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many wounded.
He was also found guilty in several other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bombings against churches in Indonesia on the sixth night of 2000.
The complaint called for life, although it could be that a man named "Demolition man" (bour) was sentenced to death because of his reputation as an expert in the production of explosives.
This decision restored the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old twins Jane and Jenny almost ten years ago during a devastating attack by Patek and other founders.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs Corteen said: "It should be set up in front of the repair shop."
Every day, I have to live with the fact that I don't see any other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when on October 12, 2002, a strong drive was fired shortly after the 23rd hour, located outside the parked supplier.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where in just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide killer fired a bag full of explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times the doctors “died”.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should face the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jama Islamia responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlase and Imama Samudru – who were repaired four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
Get 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, it's not so much.
Patek stood before the court as the last of the assassins in Bali.
The arrest was avoided for nearly ten years, but finally it was in January 2011 in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad, where about four months later US forces killed former leader Al-Qaeda Usám bin Ladina.
During the trial, an FBI agent in his testimony stated that reports of intelligence services revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Ladine in an attempt to re-connect the terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt sorry for how much grief he has caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," said Mrs Corteen.
The duck can still appeal against the judgment.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological accessories in aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of air companies will be able to use their electronic devices "from door to door" – except for calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of unawaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Travelers, however, do not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as the change is introduced, according to individual airlines, the manager of FAA Michael Huerta said to the press conference.
Air carriers will have to provide the FAA administration with the number of aircraft that comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the installation directives in order to comply with the new rules.
FAA has indicated that some airlines have already received plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
There are Delta and JetBlue companies that have already passed their plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA stated in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain doesn't give permission.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft is reduced to stop and not stop them until the aircraft is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and departure, the FAA has introduced.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher sea level are expected to meet this criterion.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as new rules are put in place safely – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in his statement.
It is already a matter of being honest that we look like "watchmen".
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and texting or downloading data will still be banned below 3 kilometres of sea level, the agency said.
The passenger will be informed that his smart phones, tablets and other devices will be switched to flight mode.
So there are still no words with friends, online game of type Scrabble, which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, expelled from the American Airlines aircraft, because he refused to turn off his equipment when the plane was parked at the gate.
And harder devices like notebooks will still have to be stored because of the fear that they might hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Phone calls will still be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones do not determine FAA, but the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
FAA may suspend the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, an expert on National Transport Safety at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create a disruption with navigational devices, but from FCC data we also know that they can cause a disturbance in the air broadcast tower," Rosenker said.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee established by the FAA administration to investigate this problem proposed last month that the government should allow wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAA has been developed to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult because the use of such devices is everywhere.
Some studies suggest that until a third of travellers forget to turn off or ignore their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radio, the technical exploitation of the time.
New airlines are much more devoted to electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also designed and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
Air carriers have already offered the use of Wi-Fi in passenger altitudes several years later.
Plans adjusted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
A large majority of airlines should adapt under the new rules to make greater use of electronic devices, said Huertová.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasting than they were in previous generations.
For example, e-readers only issue minimum broadcasts when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices download or send data.
Among those who press for restrictions to use these devices as travellers is Amazon.com.
In 2011 the representatives of this company loaded the aircraft with their electronic readings Kindle and carried out the pilot years, but no problem arose.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities represented any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Operators said that it is convinced that the disruption from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have declared that there are only pilot emergency reports to support the fact that such devices can cause a disruption of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA pilots be allowed to order passengers to shut down equipment during flight according to low visibility devices.
The Group of the Travel Industry welcomed these changes, and according to them, it is a reasonable procedure for the passenger public, which is using technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that the pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported from the garden in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported on the coast after being found exhausted on the oil surface in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One baptism was carried by a helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA in the rescue centre until he was cured.
Colin Seddon’s operating center said: “This baptism was likely to migrate from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea.”
According to him, the forces came and the shelter was found on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted by a request for help."
At the time he was baptized, he was in good condition and health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
Business for Britain (British trade) campaign was launched in April with a commitment to link businesses and define what changes in the EU relationship they want to see as British entrepreneurs and job-makers.
To this end, we have launched the largest and most complex research in which we have asked the leading British entrepreneurs about Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading companies representing British companies of the most diverse sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the research will be for many surprises.
We have found that the dreary majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want to see how the government is prioritising new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, before they stop into the long and demanding process of reforming secret European institutions.
When we asked their views on specific policy areas – from monopolistic regulations to production laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
It was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and the entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area – the agreement even expressed 40% of the large companies, which is traditionally the most pro-European companies.
Finally, our research of leading companies revealed the most outstanding knowledge, although the clear majority wants Britain to try to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
It follows from the finding that companies of different sizes and the main business groups are pushing the business sector towards a "significant change", which will transfer the impact back to Britain.
There is much to be said – the achievement of the Treaty amendment and the better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16 % when voting in the EU's reference for suspension.
The President of the Government should not weigh: this study shows that British trade supports its plan to renew British membership conditions in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to mean a significant shift from the current export of force back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and given the way in which the euro area is being spent on the road to a closer economic and fiscal union, even more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our research show, this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted: The spying has gone too far!
The United States sent "too far" to the broadcast, according to the AFP's chief American diplomat John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the minister, the collection of information served to deter terrorist attacks.
"The first recognition from Washington" according to the AFP was recorded in the middle of a fast debate on the two coasts of the Atlantic due to the scandalous discovery of the collective monitoring of data by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which has become the target of American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we ensure that it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the conversation, however, he defended current practices in particular.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations, such as attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
"We've prevented planes from falling, buildings exploded, and people were killed because we were able to be briefed on the accounts," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The affair around the U.S. research, which reportedly followed the hundreds of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also tracking the mobile phone of the German office of Angely Merkel.
European leaders have not been shielded from frustration and some of them have called on the European Union to try to reach agreements with the United States that would command or significantly restrict monitoring.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipes in Bulgaria start a new gas era
Starting the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest European energy projects, said Director Gazprom.
"Today we witness the border: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.
As soon as the whole project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream pipeline at a cheap price.
Gazprom says the building has to start in other countries in the direction of the end of this year.
The gas pipeline is designed at an annual capacity of 2.2 billion rounds of ground gas.
Hezballah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
They're waiting for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese movement of Hizballáh settled 15,000 of its warriors north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle on the mountain area of Kalamún.
According to the ongoing Israeli reports, in the middle of a two-seat emergency in western Syria, he destroyed the rockets destined for Hizballah.
This Lebanese Sheikh organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that preventing the movement of weapons into the hands of Hizballáh to Lebanon.
The reports of the Israeli Middle East emergency at arms storage in western Syria are only being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean have hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
The Al-Arab reporting station claims that two stocks were seized, in which missiles were prepared for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was the rockets of Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Jišaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizballah with rockets and Syrian aviation teaches members of the armed section Hizballah to deal with rockets.
SA-8 is an obsolete rocket with an 80-year-old Syrian army.
They're placed on a mobile trailer.
Although they are relatively primitive, with mobility and small dimensions it is easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar that turns off after the fire, so it's hard to focus on.
The Latakia lies in western Syria, in the area inhabited by the ruling alaivits.
This is a well-informed area, and Hizballáh has been involved in battles in western Syria in the past.
He claims to help protect the Syrian Shishak community, which is one of the most important.
Now it seems that 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help get the army back to Kalamún.
Together with Hizballáh, he also forces his troops into the Syrian army.
Kalamún lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country of Homs.
The battle is due, according to the source of al-Arabi, to be led by a recent attack on the Syrian Shiite Brigade Abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hizballah helped the Syrian army fight back at the Lebanese border this year.
Many rebels from Kusajra just went to Kalamun.
Recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
For reasons such as corruption, the disbursement of money for pre-supposed purchases and state orders, the increase of taxes and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the results of the elections, the majority of citizens have been eligible for this status.
The fact that they did not really care and that the state that was here (the theft and debt of this state) was actually calmed down.
Otherwise, I will not explain that 3 413 497 voters failed to deliver to the elections, 596 357 voters elected TOP 09 384 174 voters elected ODS in total thus 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all legal volunteers.
Which is the upper half.
When 1 016 829 ČSSD votes are added to the above-mentioned parties, then the old order (because all of these parties were involved in the "disposal" and the debt of the State), then 64.23% of the eligible votes were agreed with the same state.
In fact, the majority of the voters have indicated that they are not for the punishment of the perpetrators of the theft and surrender of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who shared the principles of the relevant laws are involved?
Is there any help?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) had been accused of charges against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned that prior to charges against the child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) in New South Wales complained about the sexual abuse of children.
But before the Commission, it was announced that in its opening statement to the Commission, this association stated that the case of sexual abuse of children had never been resolved in its organisation.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked where one of the employees of the YMCA Association was accused of child pornography offences, and another where a gymnast in Caringbah from the YMCA Association was convicted of sexual harassment of children in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the board's advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the YMCA association’s initial declaration was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in the YMCA organisation that assessed this organisation as the parent of children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission is that the YMCA organisation was informed that it received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society from August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA Association when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him himself had failed down when Mr. Lord took it, without ensuring that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of the rules on the safety of children.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced to 12 boys who were allowed to work in the YMCA Association for two years.
He was arrested for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, refused to claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that protected staff from reporting child safety violations by Mr. Lord.
The staff gave evidence that they were witnesses of such violations, including that Lord was with the children on his own, in particular watching them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under the authority of Lord and asked for the safety training of children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the leader of the YMCA association in Caringbah, was “very scary and often difficult to talk to him about”.
The Director-General said he did not accept the evidence from staff that they were not aware that they should contact their superiors and report the facts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had obscured their judgment, and that is why they did not find a problem.
Mr. Hare said that the Board of the YMCA Association in New South Wales had announced his opinion that training from the "Jonathan Lord's case" for the organization consisted in staff "not sending a message", and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign agreements on the maintenance of silence shortly after the indictment was established made by the general manager for services to children in YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the aim was to avoid violating evidence, but it was "excitingly bitter" and wrong.
An expert on child sexual abuse Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that would be safe for children in 2009 until 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, verification, employment, training and staff management.
The hearing was postponed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take a chance to return to the post of the Prime Minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
In the night discussion on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Office, 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, after ten years in the leadership position, Mr Blair has largely avoided talks about British politics and his comments on foreign affairs and his role in sending the Biscuitian Peace Quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the post of the Prime Minister, his answer to the London newspaper Evening Standard quoted it as saying, "Yes, of course, but it's probably hard to do so, so..."
While in Cardiff, the representatives of the experts gathered for the performance of horses to fight for the horse price, it was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But nobody was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although not yet going to school and only a few months ago did he make the first steps, this boy and his pet pet, Shetland Ponie Toffee, the smoother three rounds to finally win the main prize and leave 30 adults behind.
This unsolved twin – with the same height – was praised for its appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank driving centre in Rudry village near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, put his bar in a happy corner, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jury for its natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee got to his third birthday in March and since then he's been practicing with this Shetland ponie every day.
His mother Donna (30) said, "Fenton and Toffee are working great together."
They didn't make great hopes, but they finally left with a golden cup and a flower.
It was just the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him a phenomenal and totally foreign people wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale in southern Wales goes to the feet of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has performed horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was excited and excited."
He ran for the sand all along the arena, and although he acted so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is a stocked animal – he loves horses, tractors and farm and gets two chickens in charge.
In view of how he started, he'll be back in the year's horse competition soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
The speaker of the annual competition for horses said: “Fentons are only three, but already knows how to control ponies.”
He's a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they were held in the competition district.
They're always watching how good team work is between the ponie and who runs it – and Fenton and Toffe were on the best walnut.
I'm sure Fenton helped with some pretty clothes, he really fell in there with him.
Too many interesting newspapers are to be examined
The Chinese newspaper, which on the title page requested the release of the defendant from the contract, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
News New Express, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public application for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had received fees to invent stories about the company partly owned by the State.
The manager said that the New Express newspaper will now perform a "full repair".
The order for “work” came from the State administration for printing and publishing, advertising, film and television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that during the period from September 2012 to August 2013, New Express from the Yakcheng Group Evening News issued a number of false reports about that company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was unorganized," the manager said in his statement.
He said he had to decide to "save Chen Yongzhou's administrative penalty in the form of cancellation of the press license".
He also “ordered the Yakcheng group to implement the overall reform of the New Express and recommended that the responsible persons be examined in New Express and changed the management of the New Express immediately”.
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles dealing with financial imbalances in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his papers were issued on the title page of two requests for his release and claimed to be worth his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had issued false stories for payment.
"In this case, I caused the damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," said the CCTV state news station.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realize I did wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a New Express on the cover page of the apology, stating that he failed when he did not carry out sufficient control of his messages.
In recent times, several highly monitored suspects have been admitted on television.
Experts say that confessions are still being made on a regular basis, regardless of the amendment of this year's law, which prevents the authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
A tunnel for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico was found with its own railway
One of the most creative tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico has been found, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of dimensions about one time a meter as one of the most creative secrets they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of nearly six football matches, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of indefinite warehouses, where it can easily hide freight vehicles before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel was closed before the drug could be transported undetected.
Along with the discovery of a tunnel, the authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as a driver, were convicted of holding marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of a sentence, the sentence of deprivation of liberty from 10 years to after life.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, the passengers penetrate into extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the 8th largest hall in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which in front of drug cartels poses a problem as quickly as possible to get your product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a walk of about 650 meters long, equipped with colleges, which led from one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economy and the Centre propose management.
For example, a joint auction
A new, integrated new-room of the company Economy in Prague Karlina.
Economics has taken another step to transform the holding of the Centre into its media home.
Since Friday, Economy and the Centre have shared top management.
"The Association of Organizational Structures and the Personal Union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media house," comments Vice-Chairman of the Economics and Director General Kamil Chermák.
Kermak, who will be in front of a single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demoth.
The new joint trade director was named Pavel Voparíl, which is also subordinated to the auction director of the two companies Zuzana Tylčerová.
The new head of information technology became Stephen Burd.
The joint editor is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team is also the director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
The newly established function of the marketing director was entrusted to Adela Pitts.
A single service of corporate communication is new to Věra Lhotská.
The Joint Financial Director is Karel Žalud, managing human resources for both publications led by Peter Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will, among other things, allow us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, better link the content of all the titles issued and, last but not least, further significantly improve the business management of the company," Kermák added.
The company, which is owned by Zdeněk Bakala, has concluded a contract for the purchase of the Centre Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings creates servers Current.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Nastisto or portfolio of other wireless two dozen smaller websites.
The company is the publisher of the Economic News, the IHNED.cz report server, the Weeks of Respect and Economics and the quantity of printed and Internet B2B titles.
The Czech publishers have the longest success in selling digital versions of their main titles.
This year, in June, the publisher moved to newly built modern spaces in Prague Karlina.
CME's starting on TV business.
It'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The media group CME will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to bribe thousands of people.
He's planning all the side-by-side activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcast.
A group that owns Nova TV in Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia employs a total of about 4,500 people.
That's how almost a quarter of the people come to work.
The media group operates television in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of MTV.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the TV Nova TV unit abroad, it is not clear yet.
"This is premature and we really can't comment," said the communication director New Josef Koukolíček.
According to the information provided by the MF DNES, the significant release of the Czech Republic is certainly not to be avoided, but it should have a far greater impact on the personal status of the CME branch in Romania and other countries.
Both new heads of the New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took the lead in the long-term director of Adrian Sarbu, spoke to analysts during the mid-term conference talk about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce costs for the production of its own series, film and production activities.
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, the cooling tower was heated at night
In the Czech industrial area of Prague, a large-capacitated container was burned, according to the firemen apparently cooling tower.
"The fire went out on Thursday, eleven hours ago, and the fire was still burning this morning," Pavlín Adamcová, a spokesman for the Prague firemen, announced.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the environment as measured did not exceed the permitted limits.
The damage and causes of the fire are still unknown.
There were about five dozen firemen in the area of Kolben Street.
"It's about the fire of a large-capacitated tanker, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so let's stop using the tanker's transport management," she added.
According to the tr.cz server, it complicated the closure of the wrong functioning grid of the hydrants, which was why the firemen had to transport the water.
The fireman announced the second level of firefighting.
There are four degrees in total, in the most serious situations the fourth is declared.
The chemicals were also put out to verify the level of dangerous substances that could be reached in the fire.
"But they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed the hygiene standards," the speaker told the firemen.
British police delivered Assange's release notice
The British police today issued a notice on the release of founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that he had delivered the 40-year-old Australian "issue announcement" by asking him to be delivered to the police station and that if he did not do so, he might be in danger of being arrested.
Assange, under British law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court cancelled his appeal against the issue this month, thus facing the issue to Sweden for charges of sexual crimes.
Because he feared that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where this South American country asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard "had notified the 40-year-old man who requested him to travel to the police station on the day and hour he was assigned," said the speaker.
Assange still violates the terms of the bail.
The authorities refused to comment on the notification of the issue.
Assange is afraid of being issued from Sweden to the United States, where he can face charges from the espionage, because on WikiLeaks' website he published 250,000 American diplomatic documents.
The driver got 1000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from the town of Tiptree in Essex was seen on 27 May in his Mercedes Benz on a road A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a cup of tea between his thighs.
At a police court in Colchester Howie, he confessed to the charge that he was driving indiscriminately and indiscriminately.
Its accounts reached seven points, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of 90 pounds and the injection for the accused 100 pounds.
As a result of the tax on the owners of foreign properties, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance has calculated the tax on the income of the financial asset in advance, but is waiting for Mr Osborn's final decision, which, in the 2012 budget, presented a 7% transfer fee for buildings at a price of over 2 million pounds and annual purchase fees, which are own property within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the transfer fee in the housing fund in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea periods, which in the tax year 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northwood, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr Cook said: “Because of the increase in the transfer of real estate to high-value houses and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that the property of high-value property is not taxed regardless of the effect of the old tax system on the head.”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to buy properties in London, if any, that existing owners could sell”.
The previous properties – up to 5 % to 10 % of the housing market at the price – in the rich band that comes from Fulham after Wimbledon, recorded an increase of 11,8 % in record last year.
Prices in mid-London continue to show steady growth of 5,6 % year after year, but have been hampered by the encouraging ‘home market’, where, according to a survey, the real estate offices of Savillas enjoyed a southwestern, north (7,4 %) and exit (6,5 %) increase.
Scientists have explained more about the movements of the oats associated with the dog’s mood
Previous studies have shown that the joy dogs turn over more traffic (from the dog’s point of view), while the nervous dogs are mostly left on the side.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and react to these fine differences in the motion of the eye.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known to people that the left and right side of the brain have a different link to initiatives that stimulate positive or negative emotions."
We've been trying to keep an eye on other species.
He added that as with humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-wing movements and on the contrary, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionate rotation of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the incidence of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably won't take long before we understand why their eye sometimes goes on one side and on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We've given dogs films about dogs – either in the natural version or in the form of force – to get rid of any wandering moves, and we've also managed to correct the movement of the tail and reflect it more right or left."
When the animal saw a non-resistance dog move by the side of the road (from the dog’s turn of the tail), she remained completely calm.
However, when she recorded the oasis film mostly on the left (again from the dog’s turnover), their warm frequency increased and the animals acted in no way.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, it is believed that dogs have learned from experience which moves they must and must not pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet the dogs and the movement of their tails in one direction is repeatedly linked to more friendly behaviour and the movement of transport produces less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that finding can help dogs, veterinarians and practitioners better understand their animals’ emotions.
A dog behavior specialist John Bradshaw, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side of the dog were important.
Last year, Lincoln University team found out dogs were turning their heads left when they saw the aggressive dog, and the right when they looked at the happy dog.
And in another expert interview from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dogs with robots were more likely to be listed when he turned left than when they were becoming strangers – exactly the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to him, the difference can be made by the fact that dogs in these various animal studies did not perform entirely as dogs in movies or dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“Even though in the case of many different weeks, there is evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be explained – and the dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it may not take long before we understand why their eye sometimes goes on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys for Alexe Turner's disease moved a concert to Glasgow
The Arctic Monkeys Rock Group moved the concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with hrtan inflammation.
The Sheffield Group was supposed to be on Friday in the city complex of Hydro.
I mean, it's not like Alex Turner's main singer, but she made her move.
The group's announcement came after a similar delay in the fourth performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official websites, the Arctic Monkeys Group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s LG show in the Birmingham Arena and on the basis of a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys group must also postpone the presentation in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday November 1.”
"Alexi Turner was diagnosed with hrtan infection and unfortunately will not be able to emerge."
The performance in the LG arena in Birmingham will be held on November 20th and the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21st.
All the tickets for this performance remain valid.
We would like to apologize for the inconveniences caused by all those who bought their tickets.

Pope Francis names the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope František was the first to name the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
Cardinals in the clergy of the Catholic Church have the highest position right after the pope and are those who choose the pope, so Frantisek will establish his first group of men who will finally help choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
As soon as the cardinal reaches the age of 80, however, the election of the pope is no longer possible – the group is thus reduced to 120 elective cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican speaker, said that a meeting of current cardinals known as the Consistorium would be held before the celebration of the new cardinals.
“The Pope decided to announce his decision to allow the February Consistency ahead to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices list said the number of electing cardinals is likely to fall into the fall.
He said that the pope usually names as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters again to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
Consistency next year will be important because it will be the first after František was elected this March, Valero said.
At this point, there are some guidelines on Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since František established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, which has been tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
"Now French has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it's "very possible", that these cardinals the Pope is asking for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before – it's just news.
Valero said that the popes have traditionally raised the position of the cardinals of the great bishop from large places, but František is "full surprise – so we don't know who he is".
GM is downloading some new light-duty cars in the United States for repairing seat restraints
According to a Friday announcement from the US Auto Safety Authority General Motors, nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light-duty cars Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra are being downloaded to repair the problem with manual braking.
In some of these vehicles, the mechanism may be used to mount the front seats of the vehicle.
As a result, the seats are not in accordance with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the State Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that "if the vehicle gets hit in the back, the head restraint does not have to protect passengers correctly, which increases the risk of damage".
Downloaded models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM introduced a supply to the market in June and is the most important vehicle for this front American car to be placed on the market after bankruptcy in 2009.
The GM informed the supplier of the warehouse in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the owners' announcement due to the 16-day government failure, which in October weakened the growth of car sales.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra supplies, which were processed for the 2014 models, stood up for about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, declared GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
The shares at the New York Stock Exchange grew by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
'Zoufalý's scream of Obama's voters
I chose both times – I shared hope of a possible change
Says Obama's honest efforts have destroyed the Republican side's obstruction
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the passions of Obama’s websites for health care or attacks of unmanned aircraft
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard the second year.
I'm reading a terrible book these days.
About this book, I thought that during the dark days of my second year in medical school, I would be encouraged and renewed by hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a commemoration of the presidential campaign Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finish my patient sentences tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and shows took your breath.
The elections ended with overcrowding and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My associates cried out joyfully, and my parents hid the papers they had received.
The White House was headed for a young team of visionaries, and the nation was ready to change.
Obama had 82 per cent of its support during its deployment to the office in 2008.
And this is where I close my book.
Going to the present is a tough awakening, like talking out of a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I entered my first election card, there really was a change.
It was definitely nothing of what I imagined.
I recognise that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on affordable care through the withdrawal of our armies from Iraq and the end of the policy "to ask nothing, say nothing" after the death of Usám bin Ladina.
In addition, I am convinced that the parties' obstructions have returned so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the public's choice of health care and the closure of the base in Guantaná.
But after many situations, when I defended Obama's administration from colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit as to the explanation they can provide.
I felt political despair instead.
The obstruction of the Republicans cannot explain the agreement with the listening of foreign leaders or the flow of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children in the sea.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, or that it pursues those who reveal the wrong conduct of the government.
They cannot be made responsible for the correction of Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without proper trial or for limiting public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaign.
They cannot justify finding a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "more unaggressive ... than Nixon's administrative."
And more recently, they cannot even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the availability of easy website care.
I don't know if anything like this could happen.
Should I have known in 18 years that the government might be opposed to the political campaigns that preceded it.
The volunteer function obviously has no predictable duration and our public talks will create an opposition political party and random events, such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above appear to be largely the result of the administrative decision.
And that hurts the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unscrupulous alternative, and he didn't seem to be able to rely on his policy or position.
I felt that the second functional period for Obama, released from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes that we had ever heard of.
However, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support this week falling below 45% – is more difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises they've lost.
This week, I read in the book the chapter about how Obama suffered a hard defeat with Clinton in primary schools in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We can't forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are exclusively the opinions of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that the president of the government, Tony Abbott, is at the forefront of the parental leave program.
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer say the president of the government, Tony Abbott, is very interested in the parental leave program, because his daughters can get tired and tired of it.
The Banyan magnet, which runs a dispute over the amount of coal tax of $6 million, made this claim when he tried to get rid of the table of the question whether it was in the middle of interest.
Palmer's United Party may hold up to four votes in the Senate, which have a key role to play in deciding whether or not to collect taxes from coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that there could only be ministers in the middle of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have personal advantage from the policy.
"He got into a great deal of interest with regard to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughter was pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would receive parental leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election of the electoral commission, Mr Palmer officially declared himself the winner of the Fairfax chair in the Sunshine Coast area due to the success of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Daughter Tony Abbotta Frances in Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the elections are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately and have results at midnight?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of lawsuits to mark ballots.
Is it that the results can fade if someone doesn't like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of wheat seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibility of an electronic vote and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to the airport in the area of Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new work “very seriously”.
The public office is a public service.
"We do not seek any reward except that we can serve companies at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
The scientists have come to the conclusion that they wash your hands with change and smell.
The experiment was attended by 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve an unresolved role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after the accident had acted much more optimistic than those who had not touched their hands.
Also, the group "with their hands washed" in the next test led better than the other one.
Nevertheless, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not wash them.
The results of the "dead" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not record any previous failure.
The results of the test show, according to psychologists, that body purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, there's less motivation, tests have to focus much more on further tests.
If we were to transfer the results of our research to the Czech Republic, we'd probably be the most optimistic after we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not have their hands, but on the way to the city transport it is now a fifth.
In hygiene, it is also used in the garden or in the workshop, where 85 percent of the people wash their hands.
Eating a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent study revealed that there is a difference in perception of Czechs and Slovaks, as much as it is necessary to wash hands after handing to a stranger.
In this situation, the hands wash 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks.
The research showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be in place, I am afraid that reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," commented skin doctor Claudia Komárková.
RBS suspends two traders with foreign currency
According to two persons informed of the situation, the Scottish King's Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities of suspicious machines with the currency market is increasingly frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities in investigating the world's largest financial market, where each day they change the owners of USD 5.3 billion.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which would respond to the scandal with the manipulation rate of LIBOR (London interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received an information request from the authorities this month.
"Our insatiable search in this matter continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and our other bodies," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people who are close to this event stated that RBS has transmitted to the British financial institution the records of e-mails and quick messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position as European President of Foreign Exchange Trade with JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President of cash trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former currency manager in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Not one of these traders was charged with any crime.
As part of Mr Usher's group, the bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said that they had dedicated themselves to this event.
The UBS bank said this week that after the Swiss control body Finma announced that he was investigating suspected foreign currency machinery on the market in several Swiss banks, he took action against some of his employees.
At least six offices worldwide – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – are examining the claim that these bankers have agreed to move with the currency market.
People informed the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also left an internal investigation or received an application for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are studying the years with the old fast news and e-mails to find cases of violations.
The investigation reports scared traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines to generate profit in investment banks' closures in the past years, but which was disrupted by the small absence of coins limiting the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid market with foreign currency it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say it does not necessarily have to be true.
The highly established trader said that despite the significant volume of daily trading with foreign currency liquidity exploration between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platform, "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on a ten-day day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she had missed out on her department for trading with the trader's shares, which cost almost US$ 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader has acted alone and that this problem has been resolved," Credit Suisse stated.
The number of infected HIV in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have seen more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the survey in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, the tests confirmed a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This results from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to it, 2 063 were infected throughout the Czech Republic.
396 Immune failure patients have already died.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has increased every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later they were 121.
In 2009, the investigation revealed 156 new diseases and then 180 in 2010.
The number before him fell to 153 years ago, but he was on the contrary record.
According to the lab, they were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, I think there is no doubt," says the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who has been leading the Prague Light House for patients for years.
From October to the end of the year 2011, the tests revealed a disease in 39 people and last year at 47, Hlavaty introduced.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
A lack of AIDS has been reported in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Whoever really wants to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through the centre with memories, churches and galleries, more than he would be able to pass through.
A lot of people read from the graves.
The graves are slowly throbbing and gain an intimate view of local reality.
They find out how many people live here, what nations, what faiths, how large and coherent families they belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they'll find out how they care for their dead people.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The Supreme Court in the United States has ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the constitution, which is a fundamental victory for Obama's administration.
With a vote of 5:4 the Court decided that the individual regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, would otherwise threaten them to pay fine – does not support the Constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The President of the Court John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining parts of the Law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which orders States to extend the possibility of obtaining sick insurance, would otherwise threaten to lose all financing of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not infrequent and contrary to the constitution.
The complaint for blocking this law has been filed by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the spring of 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
The word "Mugabe is a bullethole" no longer threatens the prison, the court has abolished the law
Until now, Zimbabwe has had to pay close attention to the public talk about Mugabe, which has ruled the country since the beginning of the 1980s, since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the criminal law, for the sake of contempt of the presidential authority, the penalty of $100 was one year's deprivation of liberty.
"State representatives should not be severely accused of people who comment on the president in households or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court declared.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will oppose the decision, the British BBC reported.
Against the law, a number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who were arrested by the police two years ago for a alleged President's attack on the police station.
In May, he ended up in prison with an opposition activist attending Mugabe's public service with a "cuckling donkey".
In August, the prosecutor charged a man for his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court also declared an anti-constitutional law limiting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose declaration will later appear to be false," said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law that enables someone to criminalize for a false declaration has a freezing effect on the right to freedom of expression," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, in March Zimbabwe has adopted a new constitution based on a referendum with broader civil freedoms.
A small step from one man’s dictatorship took place in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition led to the Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangiraje.
Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and by 2008 the world's highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 per cent.
In 2009, the government therefore completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only the currencies of other countries are payable in Zimbabwe.
The proposed economy is on the verge of a serious agricultural reform by Mugabe.
In 2000, he rediscovered the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with the farm.
Central banks will keep swap lines on hold
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fedem, the Bank of England and the Central Bank of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need.
The banks put it in their joint statement.
"It's a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economist of the London Bank of Barclays.
"I would like to see all the transitional tools of this type gradually become permanent, so it is not by my surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, the main economy of BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the momentum that began to emerge in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
The Central Bank Agreements allowed access to Euros, Dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to complete its US economy support programme, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract shall be used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency at the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore trust in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will monitor 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) has personal data.
More than a year ago, I was registered on Tipsport.cz.
But then I didn't finish because someone was sitting on the sidewalk who couldn't finish the internet registration.
And because I didn't want to drive to the other side, the registration went down, and then I moved, and that changed my address and the number of the civil registration.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that this is not going to work because I have another OP number, the address, and that it just doesn't work out, and that I have to ask for data deletion and carry out a new registration.
So I did, and on 24.10.2013 I wrote in technical support that I was asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable privacy law.
The spirit of the day has written me technical support that I have registration to finish on the sidewalk.
This started a marathon of e-mails in technical support, where, at last, after the 4th emergency, they wrote that personal data on my request had been erased.
So a man would say he could do that new registration and here they started problems again first wrote to me that my user name is already contained (I don't understand it was deleted - it's not about personal data, but finally it was deleted too).
So I used a different user name and jumped on me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration on the branch (how can they have stored something that claims they've deleted?), so I contacted again with technical support.
On my question, how could it be said to me that personal data really deleted 25.10. and that I would send an e-mail with that error.
I did that (at about 15 a.m. yesterday) and they told me today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that that's why I didn't do it because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I've been in touch with technical support for a week, and I'm going to make it clear to them that it's still not going to work.
And what if the truth is what it is (if it is not) that no one could register with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the thought e-mail and phone number and the wild worlds, the page came to me that they sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
How, though, is it possible to register on the same name and date of birth?
It's probably because Tipsport is valid for registration on e-mail and phone number and data just didn't determine how he claims.
So I once again gave this technical support that they are simply lying (whether intentionally or not) because what they write is not true.
I've shown several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. So "false" registration simply has no effect on this.
Tipsport wrote me a sentence - I'm sorry, but because you're already registered again, we can't check your claims.
And the communication's over.
Respect shall be repeated by the same sentence that the registration is valid on the name and date of birth.
They cannot accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and thus did not occur.
So, if I get it, Tipsport is not only that he's not deleting the data he claims to be, but he's still lying when he claims to be wrong.
Worse, it's easy to prove how they're lying and trying to make it look like he's on the side of the customer.
By the way, after mentioning this issue on my personal blog, things got a little moving and e-mail came from Technical Support that the matter is being referred to verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and negotiation and notice of the same mistake).
In the subway on the Bridge plays music
The transport company Hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music project in the subway.
The first piece of news, where during the operation of the meter continuously plays reproduced instrumental music, is the Bridge of Line A on the exit to Václav Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Textarář Michal Horáček has brought his new two-CD Czech calendar not only to the hall of the Colin City Social House, but above all in the series between us songs Lenku Novo, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent orchestra Matěj Benka.
After the intruder's intruder and the late musician's essay, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the podium, himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of the last of them playing in Kolina and in the theatre and the city as a whole.
"Otherwise, two types of carts were made in Cologne, with which I came into contact with a lot," he recalled.
So did President Zeman's cousin.
"Maybe we could make a tour of the districts or Dúbravce at Bratislava," he remarked about the families of other presidents.
Several times a night Horáček, who did not leave the scene and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new music scene.
The calendar also made Joseph Mánes, who gave her an eagle, about ice hockey, but at times he didn't know anything about how we meet in those places and we're scandalous about who's not a Czech.
It's also called a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang out of this board for him that was very suitable to sleep in the day, to sing at night and accompany him to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, played percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of the keyboard, cello, guitar and contrabas.
All three vocalists sang together a little respirator To the site of the heart is sitting, which immediately opened the view.
"I'm glad the song caught you, which didn't surprise me in the town of Kmocha," Michal Horáček responded.
After remembering Peter Hapku, I was introduced to Františk Segrad, in the original of Richard Müller, who was rewarded with a huge applause, Han Heger again recalled the song Father loved Lid Baar and with Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb recalled the composition of Sebastian, then Segrado sang the beautiful composition of Prague by Jard Svobodou, the stepparent and the former Kolíňák.
But it was already a conclusion, a relief in the stand and an addendum in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
There was another addendum on the playlist, but the fans didn't blow up anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole quarter sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horaček his books and even a package from the legendary LP and took pictures with any interested ones.
Berdycha with Štěpánke will add Rosol and Hájek
At the finish of the Davis Cup against Serbia appointed a non-playing Czech tennis captain Jaroslav returned to the fourth tomáš Berdých, Radek Štěpanek, Lukas Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they go to play the game rivals in the Belarusian arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from November 15th to 17.
The finals are Czech third in the last five years.
"We know we're going to a hot land, it's gonna be wild, and we've always got to focus on our performances."
"Let's go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell it the best," said Štěpanek, the winner of the last-day final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
American team in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf of Persia.
The Israelis were just showing how Syria's bombing is supposed to look.
Without unnecessary miscarriage, threats, and millions of declarations, they sent planes, you hit the target and returned.
Without getting involved in the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
All the actions refuse to confirm and no longer express themselves.
The exact opposite is confused and big-ass, the acts of unassisted Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing in the whole attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media fool themselves with their claims that it was being bombed "syrian base" or "deliveries for Hizbaláh".
I recently wrote here that while US aid to secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetorical level, Russia is happy to continue to supply the Syrian weapons.
And just a fresh delivery of Russian rockets released in the port of Latakia has become an Israeli emergency.
Clear message.
And notice, Israel again bombed Asad's regime, not the rebellion, although it should be based on popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has appointed 2 members of space units, probably Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they had been marked during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
It is known that the hero's death of two former SEALs members, who raided the CIA area in the city, was, in my opinion, the members of the CIA's secret team, which is made up of ex-military soldiers.
It took a long time to speculate what SEALs were doing on the consulate or even elsewhere located in the CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
Any information that the CIA in Libya has its official protected by bullet nests (right on one such one of the SEALs members died after a mine attack) is rather surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two unknown heroes so far.
They were members of the American team in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi they volunteered to join the attack and, together with five private contractors, took the road to the CIA area in Benghazi.
The board of directors is disappointed that during that attack, that command was not officially and completely imposed and that it just hesitated to do what it was doing.
Commander of the team, so without orders, they'll probably release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country is acting not on a one-time basis but on an ongoing US team, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
In view of the fact that nothing has been officially accepted until recently, and even now, it is only a NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's a good thing the United States is trying half the time to torture terrorism in Libya.
Even if the state-wide situation was to be resolved, it would be much more helpful.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago, the media almost gave up Iranian air forces for the extraction of American drones.
Little is known, however, how American drones effectively protect themselves.
Of course, if he happens to be able to reveal his drone in the airspace, there's nothing to do with it.
However, if Iranian drones are found in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom followed an American drone in the international space above the sea, when it was possible to first-class U.S. super runner F-22 Raptor in history.
The guy flew Phantom to check his weapon optically, without Phantom recording it on the radar, or just watching it, and then, when he suddenly appeared to him and called on an Iranian pilot to return home, he listened unrecorded.
It's no wonder that Phantom is an american product that remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself with Raptor.
We want to show that the Plzeň can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's a little paradox.
While his team has not been successful lately, the defender or trustee of Victoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that led him to return to the representation after a year.
He's got shots, he's got activity, he's been hit in the Teplí race.
Victoria scored in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplí after victory, but finally she took the only point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team will break an unpleasant series in the battle with Jablonc.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that the Jablonec will be defeated at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is preparing carefully for a hard fight with the Northies, who are playing aggressive football.
It's all about playing with Jablonce, the coach prepares us well, as we always get a lot out of the video game rival.
"I believe it will be a great match Friday night," the Czech fan's representative at the Doosan Arena tribunal.
The empty last fights didn't work out the way she wished, but Victoria's word of crisis refuses.
So it goes into football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any case.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," my advocate of the West.
Victoria's team will once again rely on fan support.
"It's Friday night, and that's what I'd like our fans, who are great, to invite."
"I believe we will give them a win," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Pèčová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it that way, it's not really a step, it's a big leap -- a leap back a few years, and that's to remember, in my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash the dishes, evaporate and do tasks.
Even though these "compulsory," it was most of the theory, the desire of parents.
The practice was completely different - coming from school, throwing a bag into the corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump pancakes.
Then, at Helen's show, and her boyfriends, they're gonna raise a rare stench of birthday celebrations for their grandmother.
And then after a few warnings, finally wash the container, evaporate, in the winter put wood into tile stones and tasks to do until after seven times under the lamp (or rely on the companion and instead of the tasks to write the beloved verse addressed to the school love).
In the morning, eat the homemade strawberry (of real fruit, not the jams that are being sold now, the contents of which are neither of the straw nor of the straw) and drink it with tea from the dried herbs that we and Mom so enjoyed collecting.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was grave silence in the room, when we recorded the sister's songs from the radio to the tapes, which spoke loudly in the old casket after Mom.
And then we moved the tapes to the courthouse, and we still played the same song, our favorite song, and we got a siphon to do it.
Or we were calling across the table using the tapes that were tied to us - and when we were at the phone call to hear better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the maid was a surka + wata.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live in such a way that we missed nothing.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPads or even mobiles and notebooks or branding.
The clothing was passed from generation to generation and the best "suit" in the dress was a drumstick of domestic production using SAVA.
From the electronics, we had enough of the satisfaction of the so-called mother of the cassette and the maximum walkman we shared with our sister, and we used the same thing on the train on the school trip.
We got more interesting playing with Aunt Klobouchka Hop or Man, don't get angry, or how I've already set out to go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, and I'm sure his parents were looking for him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't warm up with us for a long time.
My younger sister put a bullet in it, or she was so beautiful to pop the tapes, she tried if the bullet was falling.
Unfortunately he fell asleep, but it was his last voice.
Well, and he's got this case today, poor guy, on Dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a kid, she broke a bullet into the video and thought she was overplaying the recipe, and she didn't lose it, so she can't make it up to this day.
I remember how we all managed to communicate together, agree without a cell phone, computers.
Together with our sister, we made a deal with our grandmother's granddaughter when we met again next year at Grandma's, and that's how it was.
We've met.
Now you promise someone you'll see each other in a year?
I also remember the winter when we and the whole village ran out, built snowflakes, rode on a snowflake at a church on a sledgehammer.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we've heard the sister before every dinner the notorically familiar word is, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but you certainly don't have a wired soap in the citron grid in the bathroom.
After dinner, when Dad at the garage "worked" at a beer with Jarda from the village, we lay with Mom on the floor, rubbed his feet on a brick stone, opened the door and looked at the flames and listened to the cracking of wood that ran out of the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through different chats, SMS.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the albums, where the black horns are marked with black and white pictures.
And if I didn't happen to know how much it was, behind the picture is always a year of recording.
I can see that if we didn't listen very much to the cuts, and in addition, we had pants on our brother's suit of two bigger numbers, nobody ever talked to us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step forward - in reality.
By 2013, and I'll wait for what modern times will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me now are for a young adult generation so at least "hundred years after monkeys" and I think they come in a lot of ways that they don't live this time either.
I'd like that!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies charged for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents missing Nortel, filed a complaint on Thursday for infringement of the patent against mobile producers, including Google, which was auctioned in the course of Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nordel's patents for $4.5 billion, complained to the American District Court in Texas of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for infringement of the patent.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to connect the terms sought on the internet with the relevant advertising, states the complaint, which is the core of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately caught.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that function on the operating system of Google Android, which is highly competitive for mobile products Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011 Google made a $900 million price offer for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated in the fight for patents by Rockstar, Google received $12.5 billion in Motorola Mobility, which was partly motivated by a group of patents by Motorola.
“I do not succeed in trying to obtain patents that are the subject of a dispute, Google's patents have broken down and continue to break down,” the complaint states.
Rockstar strives for an increased compensation for the damage caused by Google, because according to it, it is intended to violate the patent by Google, as the complaint claims.
Miloslava Cepková: November smile
She came outside, from four degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she put off her smile, the one who still put on her clothes as a defense against the love of friendly surroundings.
This made her very happy because it was a mask that she decided not to give up on the public.
He was honest at home only in the days when she was a grandmother and had her grandson Elinka or Adika around her.
And of course when her sons called.
She remembered a lesson from endless courses of business skills.
Now they're really out of their way.
So she doesn't suck her closest one.
Then he flew to the corner.
It's like a dress on a man's shirt.
November, no other month can do that miracle to make her smile really like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Egypt introduces the office of the first freely elected President
Muhammad Mursí made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day is only hard to reconcile political troubles in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursí promised "new Egypt", when he was celebrated as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husji Mubarak, which was held 16 months earlier.
In his introduction to the Office of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursí also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the monarchy was defeated about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a settlement built with a view to the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, new Egypt and the second Republic," Mursí said during the celebration ceremony live on state television.
"The Egyptian people have today laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Murssi, a 16-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who has been an illegal organisation since its inception for the bitter attacks of individual governments for over 84 years.
When Mursi arrived in a small colony of cars shortly after 11 a.m., hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met before the building court to celebrate the President, and unlike the presidential occasion of Mubarak's period, transport was stopped only briefly in order to allow the column of the project to normally run a rough road connecting the city centre to the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Mursí, funnyly named as the uncharismatic "reservative pneumatics" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has increased sharply since his victory and his Friday performance, which was intended not only to present him as a candidate of Islamists, but also to all those who wish to bring to the end a rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursí, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to judges in a wooden chamber where he made an oath.
He later traveled to the University of Kahir, where he was to conduct an inaugural speech.
While he was watching, he received an official welcome from the military band that played national hymna.
At present, the military commander was the full-fledged marshal of Hussain Tantavi.
His coming was accompanied by a scandal of "arms and people are one hand" from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Kahir was founded in 1908 as the centre of secular education and later became the heritage of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Mursí made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrí Square, a place where a revolution was born that ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak last year, and celebratedly promised to capture again the presidential authority of his office by the military council that took them away from the expelled leader.
But with the agreement of making an official oath before the court, rather than before the parliament as usual, he submitted to the will of the army, which means that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursí's speech in Tahrí Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghettos there'll probably be police specialists, they're supposed to slow down the tension.
In Czech ghettos, police specialists should act in the future.
They'd spend half their time here.
They'd look into the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge, the environment should contribute to a reduction in tension between people from poor places and the environment.
In its proposal for a reduction of security risks, the Ministry of Interior counts.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would help mainly "fast social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor homes and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mostly Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a bubbling fluid.
According to the experts, hundreds of trouble spots have arrived in the meantime.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are escalating.
In a number of places there were anti-Roman marches.
The extremists were also joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the inside, the police are in charge of maintaining security and order in the ghetto areas.
The basic condition is that "the consistent application of equal access to the rule of law".
But it is impossible to achieve without the detailed knowledge of places and people.
A specialist would walk through the ghetto, where he would spend half his services, and the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd look into the problem site in order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or violations.
"Thanks to the commitment of trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent the whole range of illegal negotiations," he said inside.
Specialists in ghettos would receive supplements, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into the problem areas should be built from the Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
Czech Republic pays 15% of the sum, 85% of the funds.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project will take place until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied to Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is infinitely higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roman settlements," the authors of the news said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it's not clear yet.
The answer is to give an analysis that determines where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money these members will be able to release the police every year after the project is completed.
According to the project's proposal, the first election of the police officers will graduate from the strike in Slovakia.
This training should take place annually by five dozen members.
The most suitable candidates will come.
Special training should also be provided for police officers who will act in ghettos.
According to the authors, improving the situation would help mainly social housing.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
Three categories would appear inside.
The minimum standard would satisfy accommodation with precise rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would have social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
The employees would have to complete an integration plan that would include social workers.
They would have to comply with the housing order, take care of their health, send the children to school, retraining and actively look for work.
If they tried to join, they would go to a higher standard of living.
The system of temporary housing should function within at least 30 years until the next generation is "in an integrated environment".
The social housing model prepares resorts for local development and work.
They've got to move it to the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Ugliřský top - one of our youngest soups.
The coal mine is an imaginary hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with a few others, the evidence of sprinkling activity in the Low Jesenika in the time (geologically) is recent.
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of the quarter.
In view of the larger distance, on the top of the Ugliřsk Summit is an ideal white baroque statue of Miss Marie Ampozné, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden leak hat.
The host standing next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after the church’s completion, ale was cut off from four rows of July, about 1 km long.
The crossroads at the Ugliřsk Summit are already the third version, the original one was built after 1916, the second one from 2001 to 2004 alone.
At fifteen stops are wooden plastics made by the local art painter František Nedmelel.
He used different types of trees from the Low Jesnenik area.
Similarly, the elements of the mountains of the present area form an interesting geologic exposure.
The name of the sponsor shall also be given on each stop.
The coal top is the rest of the young soup.
Although data from radiometric measurements are somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
He is therefore younger than Big Red (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venushina sop (age 0.8 million years old).
There's an explosion that's been born.
It produced a significant amount of soplike ashes along with the fragments of the mountains from the ground that were found to be reddish by burning.
At the end of this phase, the lava flowed to the surface - today it is the layer of the porous celery up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption threw out red, red, and places to black tufs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters high and its part is accessible in the wall of the hole.
In the tufes there are imaginary soup pumas up to 1 m. And the second eruption was married by an elevator of lava.
At the end of the operation, a mud came out of the trunk, which today forms up to 50 m of a powerful layer of stork.
The juices in which the application of the sop ash with the lead is directed are the most common type of soup.
Because they're actually made up of species, they got the name of the Stratovulcan.
The original fungi was gradually exposed to erosion.
But he was threatened until the mountain was torn apart on the south side.
The most intense exercise took place here in 1953 - 1962.
The tufs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better heat insulation properties.
The effort has been made to stop experts and the public and to keep this unique place.
The problem is, however, in the comfort and little coherence of the mountains, which quickly explode, break and dry down.
Break's getting out pretty fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, it is warm, south-oriented, ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The solution is problematic, but in time it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are kept in a number of important locations.
At the Ugliřský top you will get a green tourist brand from Bruntál, possibly from Slezska Kočov.
Automobiles can use an unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the July elections, where a short scientific path begins.
She moved out of the villa into the barber.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a crime villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas in Orechovce.
However, the original owners of the house received it back and the tenants had to move away with a small distance.
That's why Ivana was fast looking for a replacement home for herself and her older mother then.
From the famous people got a tip for apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but the look from the fourth floor to the extensive forest park and the changeover inspired me on the other side," recalls Ivana for the first time.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year reservation.
"We live here today for more than thirteen years, and not just because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a hundred and twenty-metre apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not simple, things were arranged with friends and progressive installation took almost a year.
The new apartment was in a good condition, but had to undergo necessary adjustments, such as door painting or window replacement.
The former owner broke out the core, but the owner managed the most practically unresolved and excessively big precedent, and on the contrary the small bathroom.
The connection between the two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used to measure individual zones and to join the Sadrocardon room, which allowed new positioning of lights.
The first move she decided to make after a few years was the removal of the dome in the living room.
The apartment has changed its layout to 2 + kk, but the room has gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for laminate.
Ivan and the bathroom didn't know how to handle it.
For years, I picked up the housing magazines and looked for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
So, on the recommendation, I spoke to young architect Kamil Doudér.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivan says.
Thanks to the refurbishment of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the chair.
The architect connected the room with the bathroom and the two doors with the opening wings replaced with one of the shifts, saving the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also quite unbarrier.
The quality beads imitate the writer, in addition to the comfortable seat in the shower, at the bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamil Douder continued.
Within the order How the dream was built was a quick, but fundamental change in the living room, which was also shared by architect Martin Čeněk.
To the space that created a combination of two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping us with the classic principles of optical division, for example, with semi-trailers or Japanese walls.
"This would undermine the openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
It was possible to originally separate the bedroom and the living room.
It was enough to turn the back of two sofas and put a layer of made box between them on the periphery.
The food corner clears the walls of the floors and paints.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used quality marble, the moving door revived with a pattern.
The kitchen corner shall, where necessary, cover the moving panels with the wallpaper.
The new floor of antiallergenic marble has opposite fronts of laminate of many advantages: soft, non-slip surface without spasm and better sound insulation.
The color-extended sepsis and sepsis system is an indication of how space can be worked in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wish it was happy.
"I love Orange, I had the same shadow in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphboard with the motive of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone, architects chose a white, which supported the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were stored, among other things, into the space under no parapets.
Everything's on track, the lamps are comfortably controlled away.
In the processed interior, the contrast of the new one works perfectly with the older ones, such as the ten years old Christian mirror and the quality of the art that Ivana collects throughout her life.
The last one on the line came in the kitchen.
The boxes were previously placed on both sides, and the owner seemed a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took their number and changed the location.
The furniture in a simple design is made on the order, the white area slightly softens the perennial surface.
They went into the small room because of the sudden solution of the washing machine, the dryer and the mouse.
In view of the small kitchen, the entire wall cover was restored over the desk.
The unique graph with digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia that remind her of the favorite neighborhood she had lived in for years.
Now it seems she's happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and toilet, and the new owner chose a neutral shade of the bet.
The big shower corner has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and facilities will be in harmony.
The interior was made of material and colourful, and we tried out for its elegant, cozy, not too over-filled view.
"An additional condition for the task was a barrierless solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and availability of items of daily needs," Kamila Doudérová adds.
The Supreme Court has ruled: Sometimes it can be reached.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petra Untimee could be held guilty of any criminal acts that he could have committed before the August resolution of the Embassy.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which relates to demonstrations in Snow White.
In the case of former Members of ODS Ivan Fuksy, Mark Šnajdra and Petra Tluchoře, on the contrary, he decided that he could not be punished for any criminal offences until last November, said the spokesman of the Supreme Court Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the Court rejected the proposal of State representative Iva Ištvana, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the MPs.
According to him, they received a payment in the form of luxury jobs in state firms for giving up their mandate and not having problems approving the laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered these positions could continue to be reached.
With Vít Bartou also detained an anti-corruption police officer
Bart's advocate Oldrich Chudoba, who also represented her in the cause of alleged corruption of VV MPs, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said, "Yes, I represent my client in this matter, but I cannot comment further on the protection of hidden facts."
According to the information, the case is resolved by the General Inspection of the Security Councils (GIBS).
The server said that Bart could buy hidden information from the police.
According to the first-order server.cz, the case may have been related to the cause of former police President Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the function of Bart was allegedly attempted.
The latest information, however, shows that the detention of Vita Barty with Peter Lessy is not related.
The spokesperson for the President-in-Office of the police, Eva Kopáč, refused to comment on the case of the Prague City Representation.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of hidden realities," said Štěpánka Zenklova, a spokeswoman of the City State Department in Prague on Friday.
Bart's case is being monitored by the plaintiff right now, and its words are not directly related to the fact that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under the cover-up regime.
The reporter Novinek managed to catch up with his wife, Vita Barty Katerín, in the morning before their home in Prague, Klarov.
She just loaded the suitcases into the car and left.
She refused to express herself to the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bart's arrest was voiced by the leader of the movement of Úsvit Tomio Okamura.
According to his words, he doesn't even know what's going on in the case.
"The Life of Bart was one of many candidates many parties to our candidates, and, as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Uzvit direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he added.
Vít Bart, who in the past early elections to Sněmovna in the Plzeńsk region failed to run for the move to destroy the direct democracy of Tommy Okamura, is known for its corrupt cause of the payoff of the Members of the Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongly sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month delay.
Later, the verdict was changed and Bart was acquitted.
I want a contract in NHL.
I still have a thirst, desire, and enthusiasm
For Prospala, she was always the first to have a family, so she wanted to be fully submissive in her 38 years.
Either he gets a job in the sea and he's still going on his career, or he's definitely going to end up with a hockey game.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I look forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still looking forward to the offer.
In spite of this, he's a well-known employee who never gets away with anything.
In spite of the fact that he leaves his heart on the ice every time, he can beat his peers.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player in Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," they say resolutely.
Maybe she's waiting, apparently it's about New York Rangers, who didn't get into the season, and they have two injured attacks -- attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
How does your arrival at Rangers look?
It's just speculation.
Unless I have something on the paper, it's not worth it.
I know an article in the New York Post Journal came out that they should sign me, but that's all.
It's never been added, it's really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce to myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't they even call you from the club?
Such communication in NHL takes place every day.
That's where it's going to get into a situation where this contract really comes in.
When a player needs to get hurt, or it's not going to happen to anyone, and the manchaft doesn't slip.
There's a lot of different factors that have to meet together to get this contract.
But similar circumstances happen in New York, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's a chance there's, don't you think?
Of course, that's always the chance.
The second thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
Unfortunately, it's the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to just blow up?
I have that expectation since 5 July when the NHL opened up the market with free players, and it's still nothing.
You're going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampy for the kids and the wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
That's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a deal and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna play my father's and my husband's role, and I'm looking forward to it.
We've got two hockey matches on Sunday, it's for me and my whole family's holidays when we can go support our kids in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time tickets?
Of course, a person can think of a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I had a lot and a lot of fun.
Once it gets to such a stage that all the balls, the winnings and the recordings won't make you what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could ever do except for my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, I'm in the first place - except for the family - it's also a sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, so sorry, our children - my women - grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we would be very pleased if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to do is we're going to have a chance somewhere else in America.
We should offer them such a chance.
So you're planning on staying in America all the time?
We'll practice it as we do now.
This means that in summer we will be in the Czech Republic on the Deep Sea and around the Czech Budjejovic.
And again in the winter in Tampea or where our steps will take us.
It's perfectly perfect, to be still warm.
I was very happy in my life.
It's been said that I went against him, that became a lot of strength and rejection, and that took a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey on the payroll offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That we and our wife can choose where to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to be able to choose what they're going to do and how they're going to live.
How long in your life will you be willing to be sober, hard to train and wait for an offer?
Yeah, so that's the question I can't answer.
Today, I still have the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna last.
That can't be planned.
So it can be said that you're waiting for this season to come out and then you decide what to do?
I'm at a stage when I'm going from day to day.
The Director-General of the Czech Republic has recently announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th block of Temelín power plant will be postponed at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State energy concept and agreement by the Government of Contracts of Differences.
For these reasons, CEZ's current leadership is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholders.
A qualified manager should, however, make recommendations to shareholders and not hide behind him.
Grandma: I only rule with Sobotka.
Andrej Babish is starting to feel that his movement of the UN will not have time to learn a political movement in the opposition and that it will have to go straight to the government to create something at all.
The President of the United Nations has accepted this in the debate on the Law that will come tomorrow.
Trade and marketing ŠkoFIN leads Abraham
Its competence is the area of product and marketing and the strengthening of cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Ludzka Shantora with a function.
For the last 14 years, Abraham's professional career has been linked to the car sector.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, then in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for Alfa Romeo's brand and dealers for seven years.
His last job was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the car division for more than five years.
SchkoFIN was born in 1992.
Police evacuated the airport because of the shooting.
At an international airport in Los Angeles, they shot themselves in the morning.
That's why the police evacuated the airport, and it was supposed to be a terminal three.
The Reuters agency with a call to the California media claims that the men of the law have shot the gun of the armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, with reference to the police, stated that there was a shooter in which two to three members of the Security Administration were injured in transport.
How many people have been injured and if some victims are still not visible.
Hasici is talking about events with a larger number of wounded.
CNN: Israel bombed the military base in Syria.
The goal should be Russian missiles for Hizballáh.
Israeli military aircraft allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With the exception of the so-called U.S. government, CNN television announced this.
The Israeli printing of the explosion in the alleged storage site reported a wide range of rockets, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
The Israeli military spokesperson for CNN's question refused to comment on the incident.
"We don't talk about foreign media reports," she said.
According to the U.S. government source, Israeli raids were rockets and related equipment, which the Israelis considered could be transported to the Lebanese militant movement Hizballáh.
The AP Agency, with its withdrawal from another US security agent, informed that the Israeli raid on the Syrian territory was the Russian rockets SA-125.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the purpose of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defence system.
Satellite images of the attack area, but according to the DPA agency, showed the battery of Russian missiles of type S-125 Neva.
In addition, it was possible to see the SA-3 battery including the command center with radar to monitor the rockets and their targets.
According to the Israeli TV report, the recorded rockets have a peak of 35 kilometres and could carry a weight of 70 kilograms.
Israel has allegedly bombed rocket supplies inside Syria this year at least twice, CNN and AP have been introduced.
The Israeli army never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would involve any delivery of weapons to Hizballah or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to successfully resist this trend.
The company updated the annual profit estimate and expects record profit from recruits in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel office now expects its annual basic income to be between USD 325 million and USD 340 million compared to USD 305 million to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current development is maintained, it will represent a 12-to-seven-percent increase in the record profit of $290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created an eight-percent profit in the first half of the year, and in the second half began a rapid growth mainly in Australian and British travels outside the service journey.
"To date, our 10 countries are profit-making, and several focus on record annual profit before growth and taxation," he said.
This is Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our greatest producers of profit.
During the second half of Australia, recreation business rose, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre was running well in the recreational area, while business customers lost less.
America's trade is lost during the seasonally weaker half-years and is expected to bring a third in a series of annual profits.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher at the level of $38.20 yesterday.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia moved to Petrohrad
Eco-activists detained from September in Russia for protest against planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
She informed the AFP agency today with a call to the international green organisation Greenpeace.
At the same time, she claims that the original accusation of her anti-piracy activists has not yet been made.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after an inviolable action against the Arctic oil field were transported from a repair facility in Murmansk to a prison in Petrohrad," the organisation announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, the move was planned.
Ecological authorities first accused of piracy, which threatened them for 15 years in prison in the event of a conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that this charge would reward a smaller explosion, which threatens the lower sentence with the upper limit of seven years of freedom.
However, in today's statement, Greenpeace pointed out that the government's piracy charges had not yet been met, as promised.
That means that detention is now accused of two criminal acts.
The Powerful Investigation Committee announced last week that the charge of piracy is being replaced by the charges of extortion.
However, when thirty prisoners were detained before the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not recovered.
Instead, a new indictment was brought against everyone," the AFP quoted from Greenpeace's statement.
The Russians held three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries in mid-September at the Gazprom oil district.
Ecologists were aboard the Arctic Sunrise ship that sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, all of them have been held in custody against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Under the conditions of imprisonment, environmentalists complain.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to the AFP, today stated that the move to Petrohrad would be an easy meeting held with families and consular workers.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he warned.
She asked for help from Dutch King Willema-Alexandra one of Faiza Ouhahsen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today, Algemeen Dagblad called on the monarch to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It states that Malik has a large share in the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is, in part, part of the fights in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
During the hours of English literature, at least one Shakespeare’s game, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British beletery will need to be studied from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include the ‘hidden text’ to give reasons for further reading;
The combined courses of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language exam and will be invited to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new bases for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
For other key items, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Offqual, which oversees the graduation exams, reveals changes in the structure of the graduation exams, along with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society", and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test be "more demanding, ambitious and more stringent".
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison of school in Australia, mathematics is devoted on average 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics, the coalition's sources have stated that a comprehensive graduation exam from mathematics – together with a greater emphasis on this subject in the results charts – will probably encourage schools to provide further training.
The curriculum will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Prime Minister Kanar: Rakovinou in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, there was a long heated dispute between the two wings fighting for the influence within the island's ČSSD.
It all worked out when the Prime Minister of Ostrava Petr Kainar turned to court for the non-democratic composition of the candidates.
The prosecutors, however, did not want to express themselves too much so as not to cause further damage to the party before the elections.
Now, however, the votes of the will are numbered.
The management of the island ČSSD so immediately on Monday evening called the Prime Minister of Ostrava to step out of the party, and will probably press on to lose his function.
But Peter Kainar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on in the disputes, and who's on the side of the issue, he described in the exclusive interview for Danik.
How do you perceive the outcome of the election?
ČSSD must have calculated with a much better result.
Did it hurt her in front of the elections in the media inside the party?
I'll have to imagine that social democracy could have a better election outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It's the party that's having their own internal problems, it's inside sick, and people think it's not all right.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are those internal ČSSD diseases?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through the fall for some time, and similar things are now being played in social democracy.
It's like lobbyists, people who've been expecting their condoms to be at the ODS, moved to people in the ČSSD and have an influence on them.
It then relates to the fact that police are going after the island magistrate's offices and collecting computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of all others, but many of them especially think of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two irreplaceable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current battle of power between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been getting ready for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a premonition of what is happening now in Prague.
The Haske's wing gradually occupied its position so that, after the elections, it could bring about a situation that weakens the Sobotk's wing.
A person is in politics in a situation where he sometimes has to approach compromises.
Everyone's got an internal border when the compromises don't go, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run into the studio, but when I noticed the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubosh Zaoralka that I would try to get to the country candidate so that I, as Prime Minister of Ostrava, would send the Sobotk's wing.
The Hatch's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Haška?
Famous Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD programme and to some extent about visas for the party and this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the Chairman of the Party.
It's a fight for power regardless of everything and against the states.
According to me, what Michael Hasek has now done in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you realize that the ČSSD's island leadership did not approve of your candidate?
The political parties are based on competition, which is the place of their members.
This competition should be based mainly on program visions and on the ability of those people to fill those visions.
Of course, however, people who do not have the ability or the vision to compete are also reported, but the political party is for them an elevator to the money they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start getting ahead because they break the rules, they break the position of the parties.
They're doing their own political practices on the Mafia side, and I think that's how they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether a Kainar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect their views.
Therefore, did you submit a proposal before the elections to the court for preliminary measures against the form of the ČSSD candidate in Moravskoslejsk region?
The current periodic executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava is convinced by the fact that organisations which do not comply with it can cancel, aim to establish a new organisation, phase out the uncomfortable members of the party.
One example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednářek from the representative club, but he filed a complaint against it and then they decided to cancel it.
This indicates that demanding compliance with the party's position in court is the last option, but at a time when the other ways and control authorities within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The task of managing the island's ČSSD in front of the envoy Adam Rykała is to withdraw you from the position of prime minister.
It's a public secret that this post has the honor of Mayor Poruby Lumír Palyza.
That's right, Adam Rykal and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me off the phone.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they get their power on the side.
When I went back to the past, so all I had to do was play around the Baník Ostrava football club and buy a baseball stadium, it was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could mark me as a man who gives money to where he doesn't belong.
Then the city bought a property that has strategically high value for it.
So, how do you see this with your suspension in the function of the primary?
The Committee of the Regions has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our disturbances in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Get the thieves!"
When we look at the results of my work in the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in the island's social democracy who would initiate and prosecut, sometimes against the members of the party, the creation of so many developmental things as industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
I'm getting uncomfortable, though.
I don't read it except that I'm preventing the others from going to places they're looking for.
Are you going to fight these things again?
Because if this republic is to function well, it must also work well with the political parties.
It's hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively drive a state if they can't even drive themselves.
So I don't think I'd leave the ČSSD right now, because I think the one who causes cancer on this side is not me, but these people who are trying to insult me.
The Lolomouc opens in the historic center of the public claustro
The organizer of the Olympic Christmas Markets and Winter Brawl Paul Sáléní stated that the preparatory work at the workshop was launched on 26 October and since mid-term it has been in operation to aggregate the production of ice.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters strong and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The castle has a area of 375 square meters, the podium has taken 358 square meters.
The Brusselsians and the twins will also have two cans with a poncho.
"We expanded the floor area, enlarged the space before the stands, and almost the whole area of the podium is torn apart so that the brusslers can easily be renamed," described Burny.
The Olomouce Streets are already remembering the coming Christmas.
Last year, the key to repair the Lower Square was installed right before the main entrance of the workshop at the Upper Square.
The settlement of the Lower Square was completed in the spring, so the ice area could return to its original location.
For the first time, people were able to blow up straight before the workers in 2009, when the key was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural programme, will be launched in the Upper Square month before the Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of seniors in Zlinsk will be re-solved by the national court
The Court of Justice dismissed the complaints of a 25-year-old Slovak and a 20-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men turned down the guilt.
They are threatened by 15 to 20 years of imprisonment or an exceptional punishment.
Speaker Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had annulled the decision of the country and had returned the matter to the hearing.
The reasons for this, the judge refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the complaint, the young men had beaten a man in his house for seven and a half years.
The senior died of a market death.
According to the complaint, her men were scratching, digging and digging all over his body, as well as his metal object, probably a gas gun, and they put about three dozen wounds in his head.
A man suffered a serious injury, such as a fracture of the skull, a stroke of the brain, or a bleeding in the brain that he suffered at the site.
The young people reportedly took up about 3,000 crowns and jewels worth about 14,000 crowns.
According to the national court, they were the only, in addition, only indirect evidence against the alleged footing, which the expert assessed as not fully identified within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
In more than ten cases, the crime scene was similar to that of the accused, but the police began to charge them as material and not smelly.
In addition, there was some doubt as to how they were loaded.
According to the Senate, no guilt was proven without any doubt.
The court, however, acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he must have fallen and hurt himself.
She did not notice the violent death of a dedicated rescue doctor.
After a few days, the criminals were contacted by delinquent doctors who discovered signs of violent death when drinking.
The police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime scene that relatives have cleared.
There was no DNA on the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradišk.
It is now punishable by the 8.5 year sentence, which was confirmed by the Court of Human Rights last year.
According to him, a group of six young men were organized, who were aware of a horrendous drop in gold.
The Loupes became October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopné.
Younger of the accused of the murder of a senior living in Uherska Garden.
In August, after 11 months, the court dismissed him.
The sweat begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Nomaje.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by construction workers who would rebuild the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojm is divided into four stages so as to reflect standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter will close the first week of the autumn
The Saxophone giant and the legend of Wayne Shorter's jazz scene will take place next Wednesday in the 18th anniversary of Struna's autumn festival.
Shorter will be released on November 6th in the Grand Hall of Lucerny together with his quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák is added to Shorter.
In shorter adjustments for the symphonic orchestra, Pegasus composition from the novel album Without A Net, as well as his older Lotus compositions and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Strans in the autumn is starting his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world over 60 years ago.
The number of interpreters he collaborated with goes from Milese Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell, to Carlos Santa.
On his musical journey, he met with Czech musician Miroslav Vitoš and Viennese parents Joe Zawinul, who in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade showed the direction of a new style of fusion.
He's been dating Wayne Shorter Quartet for the last 13 years.
Like the afterparty after the festival will be the night of the Spotlight club, which will take place on 9 November in the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the German audience presents the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who brings the Profound Bass electro-jazze formation inspired by dance styles.
The ladies' orders UEFA to publish sentences for the judge.
Dagmar Damková, president of the Czech Football Association's Judicial Commission, has stopped publishing sentences for the judges.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which it has set out in the discussion for the Law Journal.
Otherwise, the FAČR would be in danger.
The lady also refused that she would take the Plzna footballers from where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in the Gulf, but the other members of the Commission are a disgrace, for example, from Prague.
So in the event of the vote, I can lose 1:6,” Damkova said in a response to criticism, which erupted after Plzeň last played twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
So even though FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for the judge in recent months, Damkova assures the judges that they are wrong.
"Trust me that if the Commission finds out that the judge has made a mistake, the delegation will limit it to any match," Damkova said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is, according to the Dam's ban on the European Football Union.
"UEFA's publication of such information prohibits and violates strict penalties."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very important warnings that if we do not stop, there will be hard sanctions," Damkova said.
The other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the information continues to be published, the Commission could borrow money from UEFA for the education and development of decision makers.
"And you are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fill out a program for decision-makers," Damká added.
The bartender's detention is related to John and Behem: Are they behind the loss of an audience?
The police arrested the President of Vita Bart on Thursday.
He was also detained by Jan Petržílek, the head of the Anti-Corruption Police Analysis and Informatics Committee.
The detention is related to the mission of the lobbyist Roman Johnuska and former Prime Minister Paul Bém (ODS).
Information about the envoys with whom the server Novinky.cz confirmed the Czech press office's reliable source.
Following the telephone calls Janouška and Béma, who last March published the daily Young Front Today, in which both men address themselves "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show Johnouskov's influence on the steps of the city under the guidance of Beem.
The newspaper then stated that it was ordered by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, which two years later escaped to the ABL Security Agency.
That's where Bart owned it.
Server Novinky.cz pointed out that a detained criminal Petržílek was working ahead of his entry to the anti-corruption police just for the BIS.
To the anti-corruption agency that subsequently took care of the mission, Petržílek moved to the same time they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I can't confirm anything or say anything at all," complainant Michal Muravský of the City State Department in Prague said.
He also refused to confirm that the cause was being monitored.
For the same reason, the case does not want to comment on an inspection.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for a new civil law.
As of 1 January 2014, the new Civilian Law and Business Corporation Act will be intensified by six companies from ten.
Only eight percent of the company’s respondents indicated that the issues associated with both key codes in their company had not been resolved at all.
This results from a study by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which found out the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the coming period of effectiveness of both key codes, at the very last moment, a number of managers are beginning to realize how they can have a significant impact on their company’s business.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years, in our view, will affect all citizens and businesses in the Czech Republic.
For the sake of policy-making, the business sector has lived for a long time in uncertainty whether or not revolutionary changes will finally happen.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to move on to new rights for their companies without complications," commented the partners Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačil.
Of the 61 per cent of companies actively engaged in new laws, 26 per cent stated that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Further 35 per cent of companies from this number are planning to take the necessary measures at the nearest time.
To this end, every fifth company has not yet been able to recadify, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent has no opinion and cannot judge the problem.
Only eight percent of companies admit that the issues associated with the codifications have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new civil law is the largest number of companies in question of the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent), following the settlement of trading conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the property and liability for damage (up to ten per cent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important news is the whole of the codification, which is the unification of the amendment of contracts only within the framework of a new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial law will disappear, resulting in a more transparent treaty law for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment will offer a lot of news with emphasis on greater freedom to organise relations," lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukás Suddaní pointed out.
In the context of the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory authorities.
The following are the topics related to changes in the call for and the duration of the rolling stock (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legislative amendment means the strengthening of obligations and possible impacts for statutory authorities, in particular in the event of a collapse or a fall in the company.
"In practice, this means that if members of representations and contractors do not deal with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the dangerous collapse of society, they may benefit from the performance of the function up to the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Cartier's style as a living language

Travels through the bay, the river and the jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not too many doctors in West Africa; only one per 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your cell phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates at the CNN Hrdin Prize in 2013.
In the competition for the price of CNN Hrdina in 2013, you can vote for it or for any of the top ten candidates.
The winner earns $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
All 21 years old Georges Bwelle has been watching his father fall unconscious again and again and goes to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde in 1981.
First, he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread into his brain, and there he developed hematomas that had affected him all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals where he received such treatment as was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave home at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon per 5,000 inhabitants.
For comparison only, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians could visit, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the health care expenditure in that country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
They can't enjoy their lives because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers did 700 free operations last year.
I became a medical surgeon myself at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a non-profit organisation ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have been helped by their group of volunteers.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people rush into delivery, cling to medical needs and travel to villages in need of help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
Suddenly the vehicles must be pushed through the river and the mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as real heroes: host, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle, with its wide smile and unsweetened energy, is very willing to engage in local pleasure.
The next day the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every expedition," Bwelle says.
They're coming to the village about 60 kilometers, and they're walking.
During each of these weeks, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get berth or gifted glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that requires school, but which many families who are poor simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team is doing a simple operation under local narcosis.
Operations are usually carried out at the building school, at the workshop or at home; after surgery, the patient wakes up and goes to the recovery site to release the other patient.
With light from the generator, the operating room, and Bwelle's hygiene equipment, and his volunteers are working in the early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but rural musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
"To stay up and continue at work, they play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroon’s doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free operations last year and realized that their assistance could mean a lot to locals.
One man said he'd be able to work again after surgery.
"That changes our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle hospital, he works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
It says that this second work is financed by around 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she actually sleeps,” says Katie O’Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel’s University in Philadelphia the second year and working as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and medical students, such as O'Malley, who have come from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, this is a great practice that they would not get home.
"We washed our hands thoroughly and removed the blood clots or held his tools," O'Malley says.
You'll never live as a medical student in America.
Voluntary students usually pay their way to Cameroon alone and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they get to Yaounde, the food, transport and study provides them with Bwelle.
"No doubt it's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help Cameroon's inhabitants is endless.
For Bwelle's constant fight, it's not a burden.
To help others live happier, to fulfill the promise that he gave his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát restored the functions of the main sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that these functions be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses of their representative within the structure of the office - representatives to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of my sister, and I think the department of care deserves to be given due attention from the Ministry.
In carrying out this call, it is necessary not only to be highly professional, but also to have a human approach and personal conviction.
"I'm happy and with all my responsibilities I'll try to promote the steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent nurses in our health, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with our patients' approach to perform their calls with all the empathy and help us in the public eye to improve the image of the sister," says Alena Šmidadová.
The newly appointed Chief Sister of the Czech Republic, Alena Šmidadová, also stated on the occasion of her introduction to the function that she wants to take care of the various aspects of her health position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical appointments and doctors.
"I don't essentially want to separate the appointment of doctors and nurses, but I see them standing by themselves, each having its own competence and, together with other health professionals, being a trained working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that arise in the performance of the sister's call, I notice these disagreements and I intend to participate in their solutions."
They include, for example, the simplification of medical and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of sisters are overloaded and spent on them, which could and should rather be devoted to patients," says Alena Šmidadová.
Another area to be addressed is the improvement of working conditions, the search for a better way to cooperate with the team and with the management of health services providers, the adjustment of competences and also the legal issues of employment, such as the observance of the labour law or the non-commissioning of their sister with insufficient time and place.
We often hear anonymous tapes, which are not documented in a particular case because of concern about the possible situation where violations of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the functions of the Czech Chief Sister could in this case serve as a guarantee of the preservation of the anonymity of such complaint and allow the specific case to be examined by the competent authorities," Alen Šmidadová concludes.
Ms. Alena Šmidadová studied the High School of Health in the field of Nurse Health (absoluted in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Karlovy in Prague in the course of the study programme Ostetravotlät - pedagogika (absolute in 1992).
Since 2010, it has acted as the head of the Department of Health and Other Non-medical Sciences and the recognition of qualifications in the Education and Science Committee of the IRB.
During her career, she worked as a nurse at an internal department bed, and also acted as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also 8 years old statutory deputy director.
From 2004 to 2009, she acted as the main sister of the Czech Prison Service.
She published several professional textbooks and articles in professional journals, devoted herself to the teaching activities in the field of medical care.
He's not a member of any political party.
To keep you from hating yourself.
The writer of Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After years, when he read, lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) issues a new novel Wind, darkness, presence.
That it is not a narrow link, suggests the number of sides comparable to his most famous part of Houstina (Peter, 2001).
For Salon Kahud another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it, so I wouldn't hate it.
To see around you the new and new clones of the human foolish masculineity, young organisms affected by blind self-esteem.
I don't even talk about our parents, the cheeks destroyed by powerless petitions, the convulsions of souls and otherwise interfering with ideologicals who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a little selling whore.
At the beginning of the thousand years, I bought a little digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, surprises, and hidden services.
I've been through it.
Sometimes I feel like my brain's burning from life on this planet.
I'd rather go for a walk and then spend the night at the lighthouse reading the books.
You're talking about the feeling of death, hate.
Was there some kind of break in the past that affected you, or are you just gonna grow old like us all?
A break occurred a long time ago, about ten years ago.
There was no name at that time.
Well, I lived after that.
There's a quiet guy in there, but he's still surprised.
I see another lonely cyclist, everyone in my tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I participate in the grand, thousands of years of movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The restless, breath-taking complex of life, when every stone is a direct legacy of our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when by way of experiment-omyl another generation of beings, which in billions of interactions per second creates some superlative, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you view your writing as a continuous process, or did you start completely from scratch?
Self-talking, or better spoken dialogue, which leads to the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows into the cold and forms in the book.
As the period of peace is followed by quiet sleep metastases of wars that may arise one day, so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt like my life's not growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'll get caught up in silence.
It is a file of questions that has formed the brain and it deals with the layers that are stored in the darkness "under the layer of consciousness".
Neocortex, gray cortex brain, asks for older evolutionary services, goes to the early summers of the brain tree.
He's talking about heartbreak, he's asking for snakes, he's looking for an answer in the bird's flight, he's raising his eye to the clouds on the sky.
Yes, the law of the ant in me and the starry sky over me.
Finally, the brain is asking for the world.
Relatively often you speak metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all memories, experiences and experiences that the person concerned has experienced.
This forest, logically and emotionally exposed and growing with trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is constantly exposed to changing presences, is trying to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes trouble comes from overload.
Analogically - as if you "fall" PC, from the speech emulator program and translators from foreign languages you would get involved first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after several failed restarts ended in the dark green prints of Biosa, in the basic system that manages functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between processor and operating memory etc.
For those who haven't understood what this is about, I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention her often - why do you care about this type of regression regularly?
Because it's a cave.
In addition to the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior, there will be a perversion.
Here it's good to tell Nietzsche, "He's been looking at the fall for so long when the fall looks at him."
It feels like a person is lost if all hopes are gone, mentally "dead" and a new quality occurs.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'm going to say something like that.
Once one fell into the tunnel and was drunk, days, months, and years ran, he was still drunk and then read, and those books taught him to swim, so to live.
He became a sinker.
I hope someone will help me with some of the phrases that have been written, like the Hrabal texts have helped me.
To what extent do you think of a reader, of a particular person who will read your text?
The one that can't tell anything meaningful, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it's the best thing Arthur Rimbaud described in a friend's letter:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the word and word formulation process."
From early on, he read the books of the old Czech tales, sailed in the basement of Captain Nema, running after Stinadle in the dark streets.
At the same time, after all the texts of the authors and their messages, it sounds like, "The sun is clear to the worlds of other Karl Hynka Machy."
What if the book's out there?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the back of the mirror that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they're in touch with me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult decision in their life.
Books are actually "life" or better called "worlds."
They are encoded in letters, experience, history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them up to life, we let their seeds flow into the brain.
In fact, it is, in its own way, something forbidden by God - to awaken another and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's the fact that DNA is stored in the spell - according to old demonological books, we accept magic.
After the book is published - as it is - a string of copyright readings awaits you.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you going to go back to it with joy, or do you feel it for years?
I'd rather just report it today.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic signs - they're inconceivable, they don't notice themselves too much, they're friendly, you don't feel lonely with them.
I give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec he was (and I hope he is still alive) one odd bookkeeper (also called Red), a happy friend and a good girl bull.
In one drink, he introduced me to individual articles from a string of readers of my book, Houstina.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown to be torn apart, a read copy of my book.
In despair, I postponed the exact scheduled tomorrow, and briefly the man cried.
We all stood there, we kneaded, we drank and we cried.
Then the young blonde mint didn't hold it, and he jumped his head out of the window into the snowflake.
It was on the ground.
We ran into the nightscape and found a happy stream of sensors, a sick soul of landscapes and a handful of fallen owners - came out and walked like a werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is formal and content different from the previous ones.
Does it also pay for the wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country over nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts into the mouth the words of an old Russian baje: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
She's lying in a dog, she's graying down the rabbits.
Horror, fear, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it somewhere.
We may have been in hell a long time ago and we've been wasting away - what role we're going to play in this country.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
The vast and unremarkable, similar movement of continents on the planet, influences our desire from such a depth and in such a width that it completely exceeds our attention - and thus, of course, we are doing exactly in the intensity of our programmed task.
We are rewarded by dopamine influx, mix of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to get married, die in defense and get new personal territories.
Sometimes it's going to get broken and we're going to make sense of it.
Only then do we have the right to call people.
This is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the ocean shore of ignorance and in the holes made of the dirty pocket catches the waves of the wind.
I have to write so I can be a man.
Obama's getting away from health care
After the wave of criticism, President Obama gave up his often repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can leave it."
With the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of statements from suppliers of the Republic, the President of the United States has been accused of fraud in recent days.
Yesterday Obama broke his original promise.
"Many people who have health insurance are able to leave them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called "a gap in the media" about the statements, Obama called on the Americans who received this notice to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Available Care Act.
"I say this to these Americans at the same time: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in his statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Act on Available Care, said that the launch of the internet market had been "poor" since October.
"I am disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Sébelius, quoted yesterday as saying that he had caught up with the busy microphone, asked the council to sit behind her at the Committee's yesterday's discussion, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative of Missouri, who was concerned about whether she should be involved in Obama's care programme herself.
More than three hours during Sebelius' hearings, he repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Law on affordable care was not voluntarily issued by the government of sponsored insurance, and did not purchase a program through HealthCare.gov, which is now forcing millions of Americans.
What billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy operator O2.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and according to the most diverse sources of the agency, they are already hand in hand.
The transaction notice should come even in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for the LTE network, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
This was released under the Sazka Telecommunications label to auction frequencies for the LTE network.
And for the general surprise, until then, the taste of the company had not gone into telecommunications.
But Sazku is now leading a very experienced telecoms fan Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing manager of the Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), later became director of the Slovenian T-Mobile and was last head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Saska plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now she's admitting she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone's.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not be popular under the normal circumstances of Vodafone, but according to the information provided in the Economic News, it can be a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from a competitive agreement between O2 and T-Mobile operators who will fully share their networks.
That's how the water heater needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in a trend on the LTE network (as a novelty can enhance a specially defined spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to be auctioned at all, and will not control the extraction of only limited spectrum (not sufficient frequency for all).
Vodafone can share a network with Sazko.
Vodafone lets Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respective of the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start a fast network.
The link between this begins to build a load network of LTE, which will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be happy.
The discounted money could then be lost by Vodafone as a provider of a fixed internet or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy a Czech and Slovenian O2 (Slovenian branch is a Czech daughter) immediately obtains a sufficient operator with still good profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mole that's gonna wait for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would have received Kellner as O2 and very likely in association with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that networks will be shared.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafon, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Aneb two Czech titans' business against global revolutions.
Will Czech TV ever go out without signing?
In the era of President Zeman entered a legendary stage with the ashes, so it is not difficult to listen to complaints that collects evidence of the civil family complaint.
In the past, the traditional influence of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Durdík has not been documented in such a way, so that he can sign it.
The truth is, the editors have stopped running.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a tendency of some journalists to landowners is taken - whether it is a response to the direct order, or not to use vulgarism, the typical expression of inexhaustible empathy.
And if we are already assuming a general bias, we cannot forgive ourselves the question of whether the changes in the conditions on television are being pursued by others, but not by unscrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given an opportunity.
The truth is, in the developed countries, those who say that there is no shortage of attempts to intervene in the sending of policies.
The truth, of course, is also that it does not mean that there would be no complaints to the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticise what they consider to be a tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilisation stage yet, and we don't have this situation.
Perhaps, however, in a country that thinks itself to be the most corrupt in the world, black stories about evil policies and good reporters are more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of an invisible situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings affects themselves.
JAN JANUARYK: Cursed by this country: Presidents on the ground of force
It is almost a rule that in key moments, the head of the state was not in such a way as to enable it to fulfil its national obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally younger than five years of age, he would have experienced the end of his presidential period and the events around Munich would have been a bit different.
We would probably not win the war, but after symbolic resistance, flight could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could go to London right away and not fear labor on its legitimacy.
And most of all, he wouldn't have a nation of cotton until today.
Benesh was not a stateman, and he was still in the state of Munich, but in the war with him, he started to leave the hill and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
Being on something better, he could have gone third to exile and broke the legitimacy of the communists and their rifles.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
They chose him by saying, "Mr. President won't get into the situation he'd decide."
But he had to, even though it wasn't a big decision with a knife on his neck at Hitler's office.
The chief of research František Moravec said in the last days in March 1939 that everything should be done so that the occupation he knew on the exact day did not go so smoothly and with such profit.
The president and the savings government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
Gottwald's human concern allowed him to repair his flying allies, as Moscow ordered him.
People of Freedom definitely failed to share in normalization and had to sit him, already quite old.
That Husák was a powerless and sick depressing old man in November 89, but that's the only treasure.
Havel was lucky he hasn't met him in the office in the last few years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis student, but many of his senses suggest that thinking processes are no longer what they used to be.
And now we have this.
The head of the state and the chief commander of the armed forces seems to be, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, now there is no danger of the Republic's external threat.
Or maybe it's a threat, it's just not the way to see it.
Then it is a question of whether it is exceptionally (historically) good that the President is not fully in power.
It's not normal.
Can we not elect a president in this country once again to be acceptable to someone who is mentally and environmentally sound?
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth, are not the subject that American jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter would be pursuing ice-cream.
In the concept of his quartet, which, on November 6th, in the great hall of Prague Lucerny, ends this year's anniversary of Struna's autumn festival, which is all related to everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter are the current feelings of musicians.
According to his tasks, two generations younger colleagues have to play what they're just experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affairs and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is a freshly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-year-old Grammy carrier, a former companion of Milese Davis, and today the largest living jazz saxophoneist - does not like to explain.
He doesn't talk too much about music, even though his overall outlook on life is closely related to music.
In my 80 ’ s, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let your life be a surprise.
"too many people plan everything and then they're disappointed when things get different," says Shorter.
How the Tsyams brought up the markets of the Paris bar
Maybe you're scurrying over the body, and then you don't know that you're dreaming about half a kilo of it every year.
For example, it's in the mouth.
If you consume it deliberately, then you are clearly trendy: it is organic, nutritious and you have also been taken care of for a unique experience.
The offer was arranged as the first in Paris on the menu of his business at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, a chef and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
Bar, whose name was William Burroughs' inspirational book Nahy lunch, you would find in the fashion 18 district near Montmartru a visited tourist.
With fresh avocados, cooked with red peppers, cloves and raspberry eggs, guests can re-taste not only different larvae, mushrooms or water bunnies, but also four.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (not to damage the tissue wings, ankles, or eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is only learning how to eat insects, elsewhere it's normal.
The owner of the Paris bar with a progressive menu gives a number of reasons why to consume just the manure.
The first of these is an ecological benefit, because the production of wetlands is much less expensive for our planet (which concerns finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional mass.
"In addition, the wet is an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for the station Reuters.
At the same time, a young chef does not stop his profession, simply placing the goal of offering his customers a unique cooking experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant of pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just channeling new experience," he explained.
Not everyone else would think of it as consuming the fragrance of the perfumed peach, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to the served manure are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics will eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest voices and finally choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of Václav Matyás Building Entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and is not interested in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, will support significant amounts of heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials.
Every billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the State, there are significant packs and multiplication effects, and this is also one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the association of business in the construction of the Czech Republic does not, in principle, agree with the Government's resolution and calls for such steps to enable further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be identified within its framework.
LAW, 1 November 2013
Pes schrnul copper, president buried and finished about the barrels
On Thursday, President Milos Zeman left the Motel Hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lánech.
What's her health condition?
In John Kerry's unprecedented confession, he said that the American espionage " went too far"
John Kerry mentioned changing the U.S. defence position regarding his monitoring programmes and, in an unprecedented confession, said that in some cases the espionage " went too far".
The foreign minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as a "autopilot" in view of the gross disclosure of the spy activity of NSA, which was revealed by the informant Edward Snowden.
Public information has triggered a diplomatic storm between the American government and its allies.
Mr Kerry said through video-connection at an open government conference in London: "There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have really learned about some things that are being done out of austerity, because this possibility was, with reference to the second world war, difficult periods of cold war and then, of course, September 11. "
So he became the first highly established member of the U.S. government to admit that the American espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that it had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases it went too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain it to people and explain it, and he is now conducting a thorough review so that no one can feel that it has happened to abuse.
I assure you, in this process, it does not prevent the abuse of the rights of innocent persons.
Mr Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is trying to do good and that its monitoring operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is determined to kill and expel people into the air and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented airplanes from falling, from breaking down buildings, and from being repaired because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that American legislators are going to Europe to respond to the concerns of foreigners who are concerned with alleged American espionage and convinced Europeans that they must continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other persons and that they were worried about their threats that he would stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because they were disappointed in monitoring the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national and security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe stays on one ship with us, and in view of the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party, and the chairman of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations on European Affairs, said.
And I am heading towards Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work in cooperation with terrorism, regardless of their attitude towards NSA programmes.
The reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some American allies, although the chief of agencies said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstandings of the metadata that NATO allies have collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery quoted documents from Snowden that the NSA was monitoring the mobile phone of the German office of Angely Merkel and other up to 34 world leaders.
The director of the National Report James Clapper defended the union's espionage as necessary and said that one of the two sides was on a regular basis.
In the middle of the call, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip that should be carried out this year and hoped that members of both sides and chambers would appear in the delegation.
The names of the other legislators to be published in the following days are to be included.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the road was to help repair relationships, he added that they would also be prepared “a well-defined educational measure”.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people with regard to espionage programs that they use for years.
"While we are adjusting our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to realize that we are not the only ones who carry out the espionage here," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr Kerry is heading this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to the inviolability already created by the American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and also by the American monitoring activity.
Australia withdrew from Thai prison
A 20-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment on Phuket Island when she did not really claim to have been attacked by a taxi driver, turned against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially accused by the Land Court on Phuket Island of a false charge when the Thai police said that a taxi driver along with two other men who had previously detained her was attacked in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, the record from industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket Island police had a two-day conversation with Bamford before she learned that she had invented an event.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police station.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a prison in the correctional facility with a low lookout on the Phuket periphery instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
He is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
“It’s obviously a difficult time, but we hope that it will return to us as soon as possible in safety,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the judgment and was released on bail of 50,000 bakhts.
The reports from Australia indicate that in the meantime, she spent her vacation in the recreational area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal source in Thailand claims that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a judicial procedure that would increase her punishment and lead to imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian staff member of the travel office of Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to repair a horrific image for tourists, which could have been the liberating verdict.
The jagr joked: Goal from the bridge?
In the defense tape, he got a punch and no one caught him.
In addition, the escape changed after a quick advance call.
Jaromír Jagr thus scored against Tampea on Wednesday night, Thursday night then 119th winning goal in NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svobod invited the director of the Czech Dragons and asked him if I should be interested in making advertising on their most modern train of Pendolino!" he wrote to the introduction with the cover of Jagr.
I think we're kind of much alike.
I guess I'm gonna have to finish the night training so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid that then the Minister of Defence may call and would like to make an ad on a tricycle!" he added the smiles.
In addition, New Jersey has won a second victory in the row.
"And above all, you've noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrov is taking," Jagr closed.
Place of approval of the light bulb
The October elections were more than the winners brought to a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties who did not even get to the Post Office (e.g. SPOZ) but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD for their internal division.
We were served by the politicians instead of the candles for the weekend.
The leaping of elections took place by the movement of Andrej Babis, which the voters promised to change the current political style of rule.
The dissatisfaction of the election result and the gap on the winning side is recorded by the political (z) for President Milos Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters who the President Zeman publicly supported, or did not vote in the House of Representatives.
Although the President has lost strategic momentum in other policies due to an unpleasant event, he still has a number of ways to get it back - for example, by selecting the future prime minister.
While ČSSD is taking the chance to get a premium chair in my eyes, businessmen Andrei Babish are approaching.
The development of the permit is far away from the rapid and smooth creation of a stable government, but in comparison with the pre-election scenario of the left-wing ČSSD-supported communists, this development for the business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy is only a better report.
Given the strong resistance of the UN to join the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL coalition (a total of 111 Members).
In view of the disbandment in the ČSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak partner in the negotiation, the result of the coalition negotiations may be quite appealing for ČSSD.
The ČSSD Minorit government, composed of "non-humans" in the Garden, is probably not going to pass.
In addition, any government to which ČSSD will be involved will be threatened by the unsatisfying ambitions of many Social Democrats who can lead sooner or later to a further division on the side.
So I'm asking myself, "Can't we make a self-satisfaction to other early elections?"
Further elections would already be a referendum on the force of the will mandate of the movement of the UN.
The ČSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, the greater increase in income taxes or the construction of the state bank, we hope to get under the table.
The ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit are, on the other hand, consistent with, for example, business support, direct fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), employment support for disadvantaged persons, lower VAT rates for the selected product.
Third areas are most likely to exist in terms of social policy and state size.
But now the UN has a proposal, so the program is the most likely coalitions of the UN, the ČSSD, KDU-CHSL would be more likely to move.
Which from my point of view is finally a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything that is still moving in the economy.
