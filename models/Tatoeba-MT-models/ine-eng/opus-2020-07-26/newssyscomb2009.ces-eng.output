The right-wing populists' triumph in Austria, together, has 29 per cent
The significant weakening of both sides by the current major coalitions and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought, according to the first preliminary results, the Sunday early parliamentary elections in Austria.
In particular, strong losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (ODP), where the position of President Wilhelm Molter is seriously exacerbated.
On the contrary, the Voyage Leader for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Croatian Heitman Jörg Haider is about to return triumphantly to national policy.
According to the preliminary results, the most powerful party in the country of social democracy (SPO) remains with 29.8 per cent of the votes against the last 2006 elections, however, losing 5.5 per cent of the votes.
Even worse, the GDP lost by 25.6 per cent to almost nine per cent of the vote.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in the Austrian war history, and especially of the people who have made the early elections, a disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the EVP came out of the coalition, people had a significant leap in preference to the SPÖ.
The voters, however, apparently punished them for letting the government waste.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the Chairman of the Party and current Vice-Chairman Wilhelm Molterer has already been reported.
Observers consider that this could be done by Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Presidency of the Party.
Such a development would probably make the way to an even more likely outcome from the election result, so to restore the large SpÖ and the ÖVP coalition.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) - they received 18 per cent for the first time and 11 per cent for the BZÖ - Social Democrats expressed concerns about the resumption of 1999, when the people agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 the BZÖ withdrew) to the common government, which even brought sanctions from the European Union.
This development is clearly agreed upon by Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and is proposing a return to Vienna for national policy.
The Green Party has yet to reach parliament, but it has lost easily and has fallen among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties clearly exceeded the four-percent threshold and did not reach parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Vztahy with India can cool
If a problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who had been accused in India of illegal broiling, the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg would have found a certain cooling of Czech-India relations.
The minister introduced it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian protégé Pranábe Mukherdzi.
"If it did not work out, yes, then some cooling would happen," he noted after a meeting that took place from the Czech initiative.
Mukherdzi said after the hearing that in judicial matters the executive might be too difficult to deal with.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Schváchy, who was acquitted and subjected to torture, the central government may deal with the local government in Darjiling, where the matter falls under jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be according to Mukherdzi's best to appeal to the higher court.
Then he could ask for bail and wait for a sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that he also expressed himself as his partner in the discussion.
"Recommendation to a higher court, then it would be possible to love him," said Czech diplomat chief.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in the whole matter is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already provided by the Indian side.
"We are most interested in maintaining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the CZK said, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the deep miscarriage and regret of these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question of whether he got a commitment from the Indian side to deal with things, the minister avoided.
"I've got quite enough promises already," he said.
Czech judges battle on the bottom of the sea
It will come to a walled electronic map to which Australia and the adjacent maritime areas are depicted.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but the little point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is, however, large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to a three-year team of UN Division of Oceans and Maritime Law.
His boss, the head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is watching the lecture and sometimes adds.
There's a work enamel and enthusiasm.
The bottom of the sea hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, ore and other non-growth raw materials, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing cancer medicine.
Lower than the bottom
The coastal states today have begun to vacate the new sub-sea area.
According to the UN Convention, they enjoy their rights, which were agreed upon in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It has an exclusive claim under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
"It is simply taken, as a continental shelf, that part of the seabed and its base, which is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea.
It goes beyond the coast, often even beyond the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of external frontiers of the continental shelf shall be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific documentation based on a number of cost-effective surveys and measurements.
It's the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far discussed five requests, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three countries have so far succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The world's announcement has recently noted Australia's success, which has significantly expanded its sub-sea countries as the first.
However, he also gained New Zealand - a seabed that the Commission approved last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit they will earn in the future from using the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
It shall submit its applications gradually to the other States.
They can do this up to ten years from the time they ratified the Monte Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, the convention declared "the common heritage of humanity".
There's no state in here anymore.
The right of movement in this area shall be granted by a convention established by an international institution.
"The bottom of the sea, however, is not a Klondike," says chief Mikulk, chiefly, saying that his "single areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually affected."
Czech in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of some Eastern bloc within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
In 1991 it was awarded under the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of the so-called "promotional investor".
He has the right to live in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area under investigation by the investor is much bigger than the former Czechoslovakian.
The bottom is a member, it's a kind of underwater replica of Tater.
"There can be a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich location for polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan, states.
A Macedonian worker in Rober Sandev's division is showing one of these specifics.
He remembers a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a wonderful one that, according to legend, revived Golem.
The German specialization units were at the time of the release of hostages
The Egyptian government asked the experts to come up with a solution to the crisis with German handcuffs.
When the situation came to an end, the special units were ready, but the installation failed.
Further details are gradually obtained from the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists who have been kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the data provided by the Ministry of Defence and within, German special forces were directly involved.
According to the Ministry, both Spolska Army experts and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German Police GSG9, the Flying Police, the Spolko Criminal Office and the Technical Assistance Service (Technische Hilfswerk) were released.
According to another communiqué, both ministries from Monday afternoon, however, German forces were not required because the prisoners left their prisoners to go and flee when they recognized signs of a violent release.
The Government of Egypt has accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for local action.
"There was no luck," said one of the public ministry's speakers inside.
The attackers took away a group of passengers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians, and also eight their Egyptian leaders on September 19th in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, hostages were transferred to border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers has remained unclear for the last time, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, the rescues in Kahir are in order.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of hostages is in the care of the German Embassy.
The details of the release did not appear.
In Berlin, information is not available until rescue returns to Germany.
According to the letter "Bild" all five tourists should also fly with special forces from one of the Airbuses of Germany and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. Swedish representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress allowed a close majority to drop a savings package for the financial markets worth 700 billion dollars.
The Dow Jones index has gone down a lot.
In terms of 206 to 227 votes, the United States of America rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians both sides, for a programme that should alleviate the chaos in the financial markets, the majority have not found.
The dramatist desperately tried to convince the critics of the package worth 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on the MP to vote in favour, even though, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It is difficult to gain political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for the concerns of investors was that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised so that the package could be destroyed again after notification.
Experts are now counting with other serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the House of Representatives and the Senate should agree.
Travel agents record increasing booking numbers
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in travel:
According to one study, in the next month's booking of tickets, it grew significantly compared to the previous year - in the winter season even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans' taste for travel remains unscathed.
In the winter season, travel agents recorded an increase of 31% compared to the same period last year, as the German Traveller Reiseverband (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK market research institute, there are already an increased number of reservations for the autumn months.
Thus, according to the RDV expressed in October compared to 2007, about eleven percent was higher.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which each month evaluates data on reservations from 1200 German travel offices and interpolates them on the whole market.
As a result, the bookings of the tickets that took place by the end of August 2008 were included.
Due to the low dollar rate, mostly travels to the United States are requested, the DRV said.
In these routes, booking increases by about one third.
In addition, in Germany, Spain, Turkey and Greece are particularly targeted, as well as domestic waters.
In particular, organised visits are in course, Dr. Klaus Laepple said.
In view of the rising energy and food costs, here are the "costs for customers of food to be commensurate with, rather than for, individually organised holidays".
Leafple explained that the money can save consumers, among other things, using slevs for a temporary reservation or offer all-inclusive.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so compared to the previous year, a higher turnover will again be recorded - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip declined compared to the previous year.
My first October party
A dodecanese reclaimed poppy, a beer of tulips and prominent in the roofs of known designers.
For the first time in a beer pot.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV moderator, and she's wearing a quiet eardrum.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress's from secondhand.
One thing, however, connects us: we're not even three minutes on the beer bench, and now the photographers are throwing on us and the drums fill the memory cards - it's embarrassing for me, because I'm on October 1st.
That's how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap circle has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the Blobás equation, and so my sense of comfort in the circuit was more limited.
But right after coming to Theresienwies, everything's better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's shirt or leather pants; no one looks down or down touched - everything is perfectly normal.
The special views of the banana stand in the chocolate can only lock my shield.
One Mnichovanka reminds me that I misbehaved her: "You're free, in the middle of the lady, the right-handed, behind the back of the hearth."
They're sinking through the passageway behind the left.
"Okay," she says and smiles.
The others with subtle flirting techniques don't get so busy and they have simple plastic hats on them with the title "This drink is get dressed!" and they run on our ass round.
A young man with such displayist tendencies is called Bob, who came from England and to Octoberfest, too.
He looks like a gorgeous, with a long "oh."
That'll tell me after he's caught up with a drunk man.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks they're garbage.
So Bob's one of the scared "Wildbieslers," as the public in Bavaria is said to be free of urine.
The other lucky ones don't get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, they run around the area where Octoberfest is taking place, and they'll have to take care of them.
Doctors always find themselves in henches - in four wear a hidden vest from the apartment to the apartment.
They work like most of the guests of the beer pot: empty there, full back.
Whoever's lying under the skin of this miscarriage isn't visible.
"It's just the ones that can't go on," he calls me in answer to my question one of the doctors and disappears in the dust.
Police have published the name of the victim of an accident
The name of a 30-year-old woman who died in a hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex was published.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon reached Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a eleven-year-old man was detained for suspecting an unintended journey.
He's been released for police bail.
Turkey's diplomatic views are expanding
Long before Turkey began its efforts to enter the European Union, European powers were required to penetrate the Turkish border.
On the eastern coast of Bospor, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best memories of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpash railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a non-renaissance form.
Well, that's what the tourist guide tells you.
The building sits at the end of the tower with the tower at every corner of the corner, looking at the non-recognition from some provincial German council.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But as soon as a man gets inside the nested treasure, he can no longer doubt the size of a company whose most western gate was.
The station opened the German consortium of Anatoli-Bagdadian Corporation in August 1908.
The Germans, who had been involved in the empire's games late, intended to carry out their ambitions to control the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further to the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions grew during the first world war.
Their colleagues were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, caused by frozen boundaries of cold war, is gone
British and colonial units have come from Egypt and have expelled Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came for Hydarpash's station too.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train destroyed its processed roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, she's been a bit of a jerk, and history has been around her.
Today, however, this gate to Anatolia continues to serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding views of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, created by frozen boundaries of cold war, is gone.
The new policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on the night train in the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I had to meet with one of the leading AKP experts on foreign policy, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a horse riding around the wheels that reminded the ancient world rhythms of the famous Night Post document, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents a paradigm of Turkish consensus.
In the West, there was a suspicion, especially in Washington.
Taxi brought me to the main state of AKP, ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on the developing suburb, surrounded by half-storey houses and power shops, where middle managers in business clothing - men and women - meet to do fast early business.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a moderate policy from almost every other European political party.
Sack, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
Cold war was anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its border.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both of them.
"But I'm sure the time will come," I said, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turecko," he said, "didn't want it to come to such a decision."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost in memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are just as prosperous Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these wheels east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpaš station, after another vast majority of the night, I thought of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who were following the construction of this building a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be largely in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting in the port for a ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt that the continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, September 11th) had at his disposal the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Congregation.
As part of the periodic music plan, he founded the year on the excellent young group of Proteus.
He was up to 21 years old, but at the time that Proteus was singing last in 1979, some of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to go to any music that was presented to him - whether made by madrigaly or by Messiaen, whether alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often amazing, always exciting, and all because of the inspiration of the one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often did Todd just tell us to "let the music speak for ourselves"?
He said, "The treasurer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing it!"
His technique was quite clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowering.
No matter where the music standard was, he always took it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was supposed to be fit on the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed - and I have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, according to his words, simply "drawed one or two round pockets around the world."
He's gonna miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your nephew William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's notes by the author in Beyond Nab End, but that's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he did a dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Hoblon-Norman and in 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff took this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resiny "Flemenco and Life", because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was entrusted with the simplicity and strength of the action of the spectators and the consideration and respect of the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino can catch magic moments."
The second Honda attacks with its bestseller
In November, Honda started selling the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the front of this single-space vehicle has already had a significant space, it now offers even more spacious interior.
To this end, improved engines are connected, which increase the comfort of the ride and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution is more than revolution.
This is the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, many changes have occurred on this one-space vehicle.
You should mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we examine the new model, it is important to note that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the first generation.
So the first thing we'll notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period than other manufacturers to measure this model.
Although Jazz is a less-known model in Europe, in other markets it has become a phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since Hondy Jazz was placed on the market.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda, however, sets out to increase sales in his category.
Thus, while this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 pieces of Hondy Jazz in 2007, it estimated that 100,000 cars would increase in the European market by 17%.
With regard to the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model, which is 6.7% of the total sales of Hondy in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish leadership is expected to sell 2,000 pieces a year.
The immediate arrival of the new Jazz will allow the Hondu to significantly reduce the decrease in sales in Spain.
The car management thus de facto expects a year's marriage with a total number of 22,000 pieces sold, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16 %.
Honda, despite this increase in sales, increased its share in the Spanish market by 1,8 %, compared to 1,6 % of last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expected to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda depends on the success of his next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-storey hybrid compact size of 4,37 meters long, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of about 200,000 pieces a year.
As far as markets are concerned, 50 % of the Japanese producer's estimates are sold to Insight in the United States, while the remaining percentage will divide the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the sale of Hondy Insight is expected in the first months of next year, as soon as the public is represented in Valencia in January.
On the contrary, the first generation of the new Jazz has increased all sizes.
Its length has increased to 3.9 meters (five cm more), a width of 1.69 meters (two cm more) and a repair to 2.5 meters, meaning a length of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, hasn't changed and is still 1.52 meters.
Increased dimensions have also increased the inner space.
However, these benefits were achieved by using a new platform, but by putting the fuel tank in the middle of the vehicle already used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
Also, the volume of the storage space - which has a double-floor system - increased by up to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of the storage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are available at engine 1.4 because the volume of the storage space at Hondy Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipped with a mirrored panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the angle to open 80 degrees against 67 in the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Hondy Jazz is new and engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which enables lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and brings excellent improvements to the fuel system at the same time as a high-voltage moment in full engine range.
The first engine with a volume of 1,2 litre has 90 horses with a maximum torque of 114 Nm with a maximum torque of 6 000 horses.
This motor - which had a previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and emissions 125 grams of CO2.
In contrast to the previous engine that reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with power of 100 horses has combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto baby" prohibits hitchhiking
Nissan was inspired this time by nature, specifically by bees.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes the pattern of flying rabbits and thus prohibits collisions.
This is the bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in cutting prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo in cooperation with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research.
According to Kazuhira Doie, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Brand Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four Nissan security shield zone.
The robot is intended to enhance the ability to prevent collisions on the vehicles of this brand.
During the summer, each rabbit creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the safety shield of Nissan.
However, the most important are the complex bees of the eyes that are able to see in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees, which enables to fly in its personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual function, the engineers proposed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It records the obstacles that are located up to two meters away in the 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which will immediately turn it into a warning against collision.
"At a time when the obstacle is recorded, the robot is like the target of the motion and immediately changes the direction of the circle to the right or even larger angle to prevent the impact.
The greatest difference to any existing system is the fact that all flexible manoeuvres are completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
The robot cannot move upwards or downwards, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to a direction that is allowed by the rotation of its wheel, but not in an infinite amount of directions and possibilities as with the bee.
Nissan therefore used the rotation function in addition to speeding and slowing down, to prevent a robot from stumbling.
"The device only needs to process information every few seconds and to be maintained according to this data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuitions from previous maneuvers, which can work without interruption with just two inches of memory.
You may be surprised, but we don't talk about giga or mega in memory."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies, the immediate prevention of crashes, the technology Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the creation of a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the goal and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy your fear before you take the mortgage
It should be acknowledged that the US Ministry of Finance, in addition to having sufficient capital to inject, does not lack the invention.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at a bank with questionable solvency, it created a popular-scientific game "Bad Credit Hotel".
It's not "The Hotel of Bad Credits" or a complicated hotel.
The hotel and, in particular, its receptions seem murky so that a person can think once, twice and three times about whether it's the right time to ask for credit.
And then above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, even if you are not too detailed.
It is more suitable for young people than for the whole public.
What happens when the game ends?
There's a dream room inside the hotel.
At least because you don't want to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital MUFG
Morgan Stanley's bank house reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) is entering its centre, Japan's largest bank, which spends nine billion dollars to earn 21% of its capital.
The two banks explained that the MUFG intends to purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a single cost of $25.25, representing a total volume of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of the securities by 31 August.
The MUFG bank invests another six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the whole operation would be carried out on the basis of an average single price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 % under its current rate.
Morgan Stanley still lost 6.79% and got around $13.07 in greenwich time.
"This strategic link is an important opportunity to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of banking holding," explained John Mack, Director General of this American Group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to enable him to separate his activities, but at the same time it is placed under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis requires the biggest essay from Wall Street to take a far more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, inter alia, show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that he sells up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought about it a week ago," explained Tokia Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary actions.
However, given the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to reduce the risks to the minimum and also to cover."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley's securities by 7 % less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the profit from the share by about 20 %.
The Agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in the year if the latter are appointed at a certain time to be changed at a price of 50 % higher than the exchange price, i.e. around 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital that will bring the MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the speaking groups refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should cover around 15% of the payment capacity of Tier One, which is one of the best in the sector.
Morgan made it clear that from the end of August, he had reduced his balance sheet.
The last weeks were demanding for the group because its stock exchange rate was half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment linked to the long-term growth.
These costs increased the contrary on Monday, but remained high, about 12 %.
Last week Goldman Sachs announced, the only other "survival" from the big Wall Street investment bank on the banks of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, that she chose $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quit.
Re-establishing the republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuela by Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominated speaker submitted a draft of the new Constitution to the vote, in the form of his opponents and friends.
And his mission was fulfilled, since 64% of the votes, according to the official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the "yes" referendum.
"No" according to these results was 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0,7% of the voting papers were empty.
To accept the proposal of the Constitution, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two investigations carried out on the exit from the polling stations and the budgeting of the non-governmental organisation predicted a clear victory Sunday, with a range of 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa was still demanding the victory of his proposal of the Constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has won over the whole line," assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians in the province of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quit.
It is understood by itself that Rafael Correa received a blessing from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in peace by the United States of America's (OEA) observation mission, referred to the text of 444 points that will be the "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The Constitution's proposal sheds the power of the State over the economy by replacing it with the "development planning" of a country that lives above all from the consumption of oil by foreign companies and from the currency that its immigrants send.
The proposal by Correou, who was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of the state, which will be able to perform two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to release the recording.
Correa has already announced that this power will be exercised and will be replaced by a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, upholds the principle of free health and education, which the President has begun to introduce in the country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also includes banning the presence of foreign armies, which will conclude an agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
The Egyptian team seized the kidnapping of eleven tourists and their eight-fold escorts, which were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held in the desert for ten days, were transported alive and well on Monday to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, an Egyptian command was released in Chad.
The hostages flew about 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military base, close to the international airport in Kahir.
They were immediately transferred without having the opportunity to speak in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, the district residents of Kahiry to be informed by medical visits.
"They're completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the unions," Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zohjer Garran said on the road route.
Since its capture on September 19 during the safari in a vehicle with all four rounds on the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hiding place to another 35 unknown kidnappings.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one director of the agency of Egypttous, organizers of safari.
A leading representative of the Egyptian safety components indicated that 30 members of the special units, who approached the site on board two helicopters, had just gone out at night before dawn.
"The shooter was born, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said this source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He pointed out that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "bulk" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian teams.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini, from Belgrade where he is, mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professional and efficient people of our secret services, the special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
On the night before, the Sudanese army declared that it had kept a vehicle running all four wheels on board, with six of them killed, including the Chadian commander and two prisoners.
The army claimed that they were linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unit (SLA-U), which immediately refused the aforementioned movement.
Letters - Quiet majority of cultural resorts
The debate on funding culture fills the pages with new title items and is the theme of the pre-election campaign.
It's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to prejudge the poor sums provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national monuments that are starving?
Which policy dares to remind the federal government that they are neglecting their memories and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of a single Chinnon castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage should be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all national organisations, and in society.
In Quebec, in the federation of companies for the history of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers combined to 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogies on the discovery of history, the preservation of a collection of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our memories, which are hopelessly protesting when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers to old stones and forgotten graves.
When do we finally meet for history and memories?
The government of Benelux is a member of the Fortis Bank
The States of Benelux will assist the Belgian-Holland Bank of Fortis, which as the first in Europe, has been in difficulty as a result of the widespread impact of the US mortgage market crisis, partial suspension: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, amounting to EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed to participate in the European Central Bank and European Commissioner for Economic Competition this weekend.
Fortis Bank is the first in the euro area that has been in a major crisis in the international financial markets crisis that has spread in the waves for over a year, and the decision taken in this matter could in some respects be considered as precedents.
In the sense of the decision that was made on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 per cent) of the bank's property.
The bank, with absolute certainty, sells part of its equity, especially then - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The bank shares fortis started to fall early last week, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of the crisis were found in the constitution.
However, analysts agree that with their 85 thousand employees, the bank is too big to let it down.
The company's securities fell only 12 per cent on Friday, at a minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the overall market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, however, it is not realistic, according to the company’s leading representatives.
The company's management is still responsible for the fall in Fortis' shares in maritime uncertainty related to the adoption of a US package plan worth 700 billion dollars.
On Monday, the shares were slightly up.
On Friday, the new Director General Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank.
The money institution also sought out private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has signed in yet.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry, that their money will not come.
The bank's clients haven't panicked yet, and the sidewalks have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also collected several leasing companies.
Gum in the cornea
Life and health insurance in the United States on the basis of people's data on the purchase of medicines often declines the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with the contracting party.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that is valid for the use of prescription data in any case for the authorisation of the person concerned.
This must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we believe the fox's liver," quoted Washington Post Richard Dick, author of the drug prescription program.
The insurance company shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the event of insurance events dependent on the health status of the persons concerned and, where the risk is assessed as too large, shall neither close it.
They had previously sent the relevant medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of an identification number, customers from the doctor will easily find out what medication the medicine has bought for the last year and half, from which the program itself runs out, what the disease is and what its condition is.
For example, if she regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-lowering medicines, this indicates that she has practically uncontrollable high blood fat levels, which will immediately be classified as a higher risk category.
Several versions of the programme are currently under way, some of which also identify the risk factor, so there is almost no work to be done, although there are minor problems.
The disadvantages include the use of laxatives for several purposes, for example, for some compounds that can be used against migraine or fever, but are also effective against depression.
They represent a significant risk-increasing factor from the commercial insurance perspective, where the first-named difficulty is not.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been established which, before providing the necessary information from the doctor, require patient permission.
To that end, it is already forced by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their present negligence.
Some companies have been working on the results of laboratory examinations, which are linked to the data on medications used, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
The data has access to more and more companies, and at the same time it will be more difficult to control their use.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health services and insurance providers.
The proposal for a law that gives the authorities the power to control and the companies specializing in the provision of data is before the Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, he developed his program in such a way that data transmission is linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the permit in question can only be difficult to resist, otherwise insurance will not close the contract with him.
So the monkeys are just kind of referred to the leaf of good will.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double the turnover
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic has led to other, mainly global, issues, as well as a series of summits at the highest level.
Today there will also be a French-India summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is developing democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak on international issues, but Member States have not yet managed to find a common denominator on the issue of support for the continued membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at the 9th summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as currently President of the Union, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double the turnover by five years, or increase by more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, there is no excessive ambition.
In this respect, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been legally agreed, so green air transport has been made available in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be speeded up.
The aim is to balance the balance sheet while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Dilli is among the EU's partners to the ninth place.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, has been condemned by both sides in all its forms and called for an accelerated convening of the UN conference.
They also ordered the end of the Dauha trade round, although they both have a large share in his current ill-treatment.
The European Union has confirmed that it will continue on its energy and climate programme, which would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as that the climate conference for next year would need to conclude a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent increased food prices and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister joins the French capital, where he is about to close the trade on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the French companies receive the mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth €20 billion.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers are participating in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 square meters of fairs with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honest guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy is in fact participating institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 metres of four-quarters exhibition grounds.
It will follow the press meeting in Room Structure Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: this will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign authors in relation to total Italian production is still diminished, mainly in the light of literature for children and adults.
Found a plane of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared on 3 February 2007, was found while flying through the desert in Nevada.
The Troskys were discovered at one level above sea level three thousand meters, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madeira County, John Anderson, raised the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent the team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The sheriff explained that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old is considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after recognition of the concerns, an investigation team was sent that finally identified the aircraft: it was exactly Bellanca 8kcab, not reported since 3 February 2007, when Fossett flew from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of Fosset's personal objects were found near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and one bundle.
The Fossetta search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
A billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in the air balloon: two weeks of the year alone.
Three years later, the world flew on a plane and didn't land.
Among its many records are also the flight at a height of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, even with the copilot.
Glk, a commercial you don't expect
One unusual suv with original design and precisely defined straight lines, wide surfaces with exact corners.
This is, in short, the last Glk of the "compact" jeeps of the house of the star, by which Mercedes-Benz tried to introduce faith news into this sector.
Thanks to its non-traditional processing, it will be unexpected and unconventional and communication which will accompany the launch of Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
This way the advertising campaign, which follows the debut of the new vehicle, also launches an informal way of communication thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which was first used in Italy for the car brand.
The Maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan trade class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin by introducing a car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
In fact, if you look at the picture, you'll feel that the car's leaving the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its little things, so that it can then be incorporated in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce this ad to something new in the stereotype area of car communication.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italian chulgans are.
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the Ultras Italia group, which has been following Nazionale Azzurra for years, and which has, in fact, never done too many problems.
She's never even met an opponent's fans.
The group's orientation is right.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padovy, Tersta and Udine.
In Sofia, groups were added (in fact few groups) with Campania and Puglie.
They have three-coloured flags showing the cities of origin of the participants: on Saturday night they removed them so that they were not recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all by name, so easily controllable.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the Daslem going, no one who was forbidden to visit the stadium.
Four blue fans who had previous stadium offenses were denied entry and a forbidden match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the news that will come from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo to at least five years old fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the emergency.
The International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chulgarans, briefly, don't even jump to one stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulsion: this means that more than one hundred fifty are added to them.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "suitably open eyes, mainly due to a national match in the middle of Leči."
In Puglia, there's a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory, on Tuesday Casms, which can also count with one part of Aise, is a secret service that deals with the problems at the stadiums.
"Church Leader-Leader and Charged Guards during Mamelia's Hymna?
This is Domenica Mazzilli's idea (expressed in a very little happy way), which is a couple of weeks old director of the Viminal Observatory (he got a place that was formerly Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Quaestor in Terst, where the core of the Ultras Italia supporters was founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course the conduct of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
"I am not a sociologist - he adds the Observer Unit - the crimes are committed to the country in which they became.
So far, this group has remained within the limits, now we look closely at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let us also speak of the resurrection of Mary in humility: it is not a crime, but if you allow it, it is a fornication....
