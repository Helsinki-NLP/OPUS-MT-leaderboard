Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters burned
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and must not leave the farm.
A security service is monitoring the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positively on the Corona-Ereger Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the Dingolfing-Landau Landau Landing Board on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further proliferation, we have to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had already been infected in the holding before - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable garden, the strawberries, barley, coal and red beet - but the barley is only for storage bottles.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of 3300 people not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW work.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to maintain peace: "After our information it is a closed circle of persons".
The court has been separated from non-infected employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier.
Greens and SPDs were co-responsibility to the government.
The two opposition factions, Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet, proposed to neglect the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be worse if such local infectious events occur and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof In the middle of May we have already requested a special control programme for farms with crop aid," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"The health conditions at work and living conditions need to be closely monitored from our point of view.
This obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak was "with an announcement".

Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage of storage data
The storage of stock data is currently suspended.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage time after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data - instead of the planned ten weeks a half year after a media report.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter about a rapid change of law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He considers it meaningful to "make the necessary adjustments in the law already," the paper quoted from the letter.
The storage of stock data is currently suspended.
A decision of the EuGH is expected to do so.
But seehofer already wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive ruling, that is to say in the report.
A spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice said the paper said that it could only be reasonably examined whether legal adjustments were necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the domestic ministers of the countries, had already spoken for a storage of data in June.
NBA: Strip club cores for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Exciting in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), the Los Angeles Clippers basketball pro, is supposed to leave the tournament neighborhood in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for an award.
According to U.S. news, he visited the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who should have given the visit according to ESPN data, is again in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best waves in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA Williams has arranged a ten-day quarantine.
This way, the Clippers star misses the first two official parties after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Crown season.
At present, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finals starting on Friday night.
Söder expresses himself after mass infection to the Corona position
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) already announced a tefofensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has frightened authorities and politicians.
At the large vegetable farm, almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working, over a third have been infected with the Corona Erreger.
The court is currently under quarantine and is closed with a building fence.
No one can leave the site, food is delivered.
The good 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free Corona tests.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Land Council has so far concluded that the infections have not spread beyond the court.
"Wisdombisse": The confession of Nantes' moderate firefight
"My mandate has been cooperative," said Counsel Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defendant added: "He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "prescribed by conscience and taken very seriously by the extent of destruction".
In the case of a conviction, the man is threatened by ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged last Saturday night by a fire.
The fire was broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory investigations have intensified the suspicion of firefighting.
The suspect now arrested had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the night before the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent entrance to the church, he quickly leads to the eyes of the murderer.
discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates facts," said Grindel of the "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can be most dangerous to Bavarian and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not necessary to discuss whether it is necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors in this phalanx."
But he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations prohibited in the Federal League by the 50+1 rule.
"There is still a legal risk of attracting investment sites in a European internal market to the Bundesliga business site," Grindel said.
The former DFB leader sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the federal league, in the end, only weaken the competitiveness of our top club at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a flat-rate distribution of TV money will not produce a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already huge among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," said 58-year-olds.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed these errors and passed through the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've already been very busy with this."
The gift worth around 11,000 euros had been received by a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a violation of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I've gone completely transparent and ugly.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never made a "hell out of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": injured and a dead

Investigations were taken.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic Costumes Rotten Corona
Although the big sauce in Kurstadt was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the large parts in the city were missing, the masses and program heights like Saale burn, Rakoczy ball or tie, many came at their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we've managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," said curator Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have liked it.
In principle, you return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, and only the historians stood in the focus of the festival.
Satisfied atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting with her husband for more than 25 years at the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen.
So is this time in the year Corona.
The couple enjoyed the Luitpold Casino, watched the historics when flanning and heard Cuban live music at the game bank restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the masses that otherwise don't belong to Rakoczy.
But for this, you miss the usual program highlights, all in front of the hall burn on Friday night as well as the historic ferry and the final fireworks on Sunday night.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Riitturnier to take place again
In part, the alternative programme meant more work for the representatives of the historical Kurgs.
Some for Christina Gold, who is involved in a normal year on the train and is seen there on the corner of the Kurgartencafe.
This year she was in costume on Saturday and Sunday walking in the city.
"That's more challenging, otherwise we have it easier," she says.
The riders had less to do, even though individual riders were on the way in the park.
"We very much hope that the tabulars will be able to take place again in the coming year," says President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years' break 2021 would also take place a Rakoczy tournament.
28 Corona cases in Spanish second-legged Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football champion CF Fuenbrarada shrinks deeper and deeper into the crisis because of a Corona outbreak.

The game was abandoned 60 minutes before the anpfiff, Tebas Llanas said.

Cycling Profi Tony Martin: career continuation can be expected
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time weather master Tony Martin can fully imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just putting down the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurt General Sunday."
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
In the negotiations with his team, it was also about the number of rental days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he was up after a storm, and the first thought was, "Quick back to the wheel.
Today I think as a father of a little daughter: what if."

"But it did me good to note from the Corona time what I have on my bike and how much fun he makes me."

Before he moved to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hessens from 2016 to 2018 and led to the victory in the DFB Pokal.
"A high-ranking opponent like Monaco is a good test for us with regard to the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Intracht-trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrians had succeeded in entering Croatia.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the eight-final match against Basel at their own stadium with 0:3.

So far, only a few have been drawn.
It's hard to bring the people to Cox's Bazaar.
The enthusiasm is also maintained in the border.
Those who used to have a house were also so small and close to a hut that they often did not want to spend their lives in a large living block.
Many apartments are empty, but - so the government wants - soon to be contacted by those who have lost their house through the floods.

Argentina rejects the offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of children live in Argentina in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our believers."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer viable under the current conditions.
Argentina therefore calls on its private creditors to refuse some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state square.
It would be the ninth drop in payment in Argentine history.
Lastly, the creditors had required higher interest on State bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government remains firm in its last offer and is not prepared for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a difficult financial and economic crisis.
The last inflation rate was more than 50 per cent.
For the current year, experts estimate a decrease in economic power by about 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to compare interest payments of $503 million and thus resulted in a limited drop in payments.
Professional arrival - not yet private
"It's going great" - this is Dr. Stefanie Kramer pulling after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very fast: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer found out that she was going to be the successor of Lutz Feler at the Eggenfelde Notariatspost.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the promoted lawyer took up the work, the normal daily business is going on full tours for a long time.
"I still have to get to the private, however," she explains and laughs in the conversation with the Rottler.
Of course, the short period of time has not been able to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolingerin.
She was currently working with her husband, who is a judge in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short parental period to ensure the care of both daughters (31⁄2 and 111⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to spend every day of Regensburg hangings, they also have an overnight opportunity with their parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Grown up in the neighborhood, of course, the town of Eggenfelden has long been a concept.
When visiting the site with her family in the past months, she recently discovered: "Eggenfelden is a very beautiful small town".
More than that, she was glad that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home Lowerbayern plays a central role: After the Jura study in Passau she gave up her reference period and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessorin, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Underallgäu and Regensburg - at this time she also buried the promotion in labour law - in 2012 she entered her first position as notarin in Rotthalmünster in the Passau district.
In 2016 she moved to Regensburg in parenting, and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services at various notarial sites.
When the post in Eggenfelden was written out because of the close rest of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains 39-year-olds.
The team of its predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the Notariats post, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a praise for the team of the office ready: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on the steps taken here makes it easier for her to take care of the forthcoming movement of the private food point.
In the case of children's garden, or crippling sites, she has already made contact with a local facility.
And whatever she wants, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the root valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent for the start of the season in the case of a fan-back.
"Because of the distance system that is required to be maintained, we are planning, according to the current position, with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmunds Managing Director Carsten Cramer.
Usually, the arena takes over 81,000 spectators in the Riviera at Bundesliga games.
In the spirit games of last season caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB per party lost about four million euros.
The BVB responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation hopes that, in addition to the normal sightseeing sites, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can be reopened: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues are completely removed".
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, all of us are "well advised to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are alone in short work in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer said.
The Dortmund Marketing-Chief praised the BVB-profession for its non-participation, which is intended to contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, players know that its non-participation has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in marketing."
Winzy Wonders: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Almost harder than a packerl butter, just once three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 breakfasts that are provided annually at the Grazer Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme light weights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, intestines, or muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so thin that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and especially mini-tapes made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be with voice - "and how," clever Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even though of course they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage just before the start of the holiday was the 9th class of the Sankt-Jakobus gymnasium in Abtsgmünd.
Artist Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented to the students the production "The Home Dress" - and indeed per video.
After that, the students were able to exchange with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the piece and performance via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about the scope of the teaching.
Although all the participants agreed at the conclusion that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional travel, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the gaming industry," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round: The TSV 1860 would meet in the DFB Pokal on Entracht Frankfurt
If the TSV 1860 is qualified for the DFB Pokal, the lions meet in the first round at Entracht Frankfurt.
This resulted in the discharge on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty potential opponents in the first round of the DFB Pokal stand firm.
The lions would meet with a successful qualification at the entrance of Frankfurt.

There the lions meet either on the Würzburger Kickers or Victoria Ashchenburg.
If Würzburg's secondary climber reached the finish, 60 would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB pool.
Otherwise, the Giesinger had to implement itself in the final game against Regionalligist Ashchenburg.
The first round of the DFB Pokal will be held between 11 and 14 September and a week before the third start.

Kalbitz draft confirmed from AFD - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AFD is, in the view of the FDP, only a "feel sheet" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AFD is the parliamentary arm of the legal extremities in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the peak of the iceberg of the radicals in the AFD," said the FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, after several hours of negotiations, the AFD’s Federal Court of Justice had confirmed Kalbitz’s exclusion, which was decided by the Federal Board in May by majority.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AFD Group in Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AFD really were to remove law extremists consistently from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded for a long time," said Strasser.
"There is, however, no political will in the AFD because the legal extremism is currently part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and does not change anything," he said the "World on Sunday".
"There are more bands than many French supporters, a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AFD."
Flower assumes that the AFD will land again under five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AFD in Parliament are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the currently officially dissolved "flights" around the Thuringian AfD and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the protection of the Constitution is called "a secure right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AFD federal chief of Kalbitz threw out of the party.
As a reason he stated, Kalbitz did not state an earlier membership in the currently banned legal extremities "Heimatreueen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans at his party's entry.
Kalbitz disputes membership in HDJ.
Also, the president of the Left Group in Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Justice does not change the character of the AFD: "The Wolf has only eaten the cream.
The AFD remains a right-wing party, whether with or without calbitz."
This decision will neither weaken the Federal Party nor the right wing.
"The management of the Mutehen team is transparent.
A further observation is to be made through the protection of the Constitution and is trying to get under the radar," Walter said.
"The AFD will not leave the spirits she called.
There is no change to a draft," said Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn in Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landes Association and the Group have held their right leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AFD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now act civilly against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice.
North Sea Windparks deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea ate 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
These are well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet shared in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea stream to mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The windlass on the Baltic Sea, which is not part of Tennet’s network area, have consumed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea comes to 13,73 TWh, compared to good 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The windmill on the sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany; these are about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind parks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy comes from higher production capacities, as new wind parks have gone online in the last 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full force, they could generate a 6.7 gigawatt power.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is based on Tennet at 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030 it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we invest up to 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet CEO Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can't even use their capacity on lake, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2 when the North Sea Windparks generated more than six gigawatt power.
On average, the North Sea windmills produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt power, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the art association gallery.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration at 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Art Association, Professor Klaus Ripper.

Free: Windbergfest for Corona denied
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital rejected the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years more than 30,000 people visited this city festival.
"We did not really make this decision easy, and - in consciousness, how difficult it is for the participants - we hoped for until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partileos).
"But finally, we are responsible here as the organizer for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands of people had flocked to the mainland and to the mainland, minimum conditions, hygiene rules, and a follow-up to contact could not be complied with in accordance with the current Corona protection regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately over a number of times.
Rumberg won next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence, among other things, with the winter festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of the Sachsen from 10 to 12 September 2021.

Future more airplanes in Worms
The Wormser University continues to fly: The "DFS German Aviation Insurance" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The Treaty was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
The professor has the opportunity not only to start the study in the summer, but also to the winter semester.
This enables as many students to be trained twice as ever.
At the same time, the capacities are evenly charged both at the university and at the Air Safety Academy of the DFS.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professor.
Presented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been trained in flight training at the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management course.
This year, nine students started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the student's performance is excellent.
The combination of study and loten training contributes significantly to the further increase in the attractiveness of the loten profession.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy for us.
But we firmly expect that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to meet our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Schürle, CEO of the DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation Professor is a future-proof investment, which will provide the fleets with a long-term broad, professionally comprehensive knowledge base.
We therefore continue to cooperate well with the university and at the same time undermine our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Jens Hermsdorf, president of the University of Worms, also underlines this: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and economics.
With them, we would like to join the existing cooperation with the DFS German Aviation Insurance as a practical partner for the dual bachelor study Air Traffic Management."
The confidence of the German aviation insurance company for the University of Worms motivation and obligation to further develop their teaching and research skills in the fields of future air transport.
In the use of tomorrow's airplanes, the university with its first foundation professor could place very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students.
Dr Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasises: "The University of Worms has a unique feature in the field of air transport in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signature of the Cooperation Treaty strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescuer landing on the A 45
Around 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was completely closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue screws were in use.
A 76-year-old drove with a ford at 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed at the guideboard.
As a result, the front airbags exploded, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of 72-year-old companions were provided by the doctor and the patient flew to a hospital in conjunction with the rescue shop.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle with a damage of approximately EUR 2000 had to be removed.
Heil wants to examine other sectors according to the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Law intensifications are just ahead.
But they're on the right side - and will it stay there?
Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors, according to the strict rules currently planned, against irregularities in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry and then take appropriate measures for each industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning that work contracts are generally restricted.
After the massive outbreak of Corona during the meat crisis in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of healing on this Wednesday.
In the case of slaughter, slaughter and meat processing, wholesalers shall no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel.
It is intended to prohibit the use of workers as well as employees.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa said: "Finger away from a general restriction on workers' contracts and overtime if you do not want to completely abolish the economy".
Works contracts, for example, for wide areas of handicraft, construction industry and plant building, are the basis for their value creation with the customer.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My aim is not to prohibit working contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts were meaningful.
"If an industrial company is commissioned to build a safety facility, it is a completely normal work contract."
The German meat industry maintains a ban on works contracts and leases in its industry for constitutional reasons alone.
It is not to be explained why cheese is to be used in the future as participating and packaging of cheeses other than for wurst, as the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Samstag) reports in an opinion on the draft legislation.
Thus, in the case of a prohibition, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European workers from work contracts worked in the industry after the results of an examination of the NRW employment protection administration for 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Wages were reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But through "triangular constructions" these have been carried out.
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide at the end of July in the cabinet, there are also measures which not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for labour protection or clear criteria for Community shelters".
The present draft includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry and to the law on the protection of workers.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I wish we could do more control in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal protection, all possible, for example, animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg up to date."
But for more controls, more personnel are also needed.
Three deaths in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft crashed into a multifamily house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, according to the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two other people were injured in the accident, said one speaker of the circuit manager Wesel.

Car exceeds: Young woman in accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar seriously injured
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was brought to the clinic Kassel.
With thermal cameras, the firearm sought possible companions.
According to the police on the Bundesstraße 83, the woman was on the way towards her place of residence, when her car came off the road from an uncertain cause and overcrowded several times.
In order to save the unfortunate, the firearm had to break the roof of the apartment.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a rescue gate by Cristiano Ronaldo, the record champion Juventus Turin won the Italian Championship for the ninth time in the series.
The team around the five-time world football team made the 36th Scudetto of association history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 a.m.
With 83 points, Turin, which entered without the last long injured former national player Sami Khedira, will no longer be forced two days before the season end of the series A.
The table area Inter Milan is back seven points.
Despite optical superiority in the first half of the day, Ronaldo met after a freelance with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic was exploited by 35-year-olds from the fine line with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved at 2:0, after his gun fired Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This ensured the smooth, but decisive success.
The foulelfmeter sent to the latte in the 89th minute only Ronaldo should have been right in view of the Torjager rating.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are rare, and the moment changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the spiritual invention of his players was great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve had recently given a calm start at the top of the table, especially due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team only won five victories.
Whether Ronaldo is still a Torchus king is questionable.
Because during the Portuguese superstar reached 31 gates, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already reached 34 hits on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski paid for the title of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinier achieved 36 towers for the SSC Naples during the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, however, on August 7th against Olympic Lyon must compete a 0:1 stage in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors recorded
Stuttgart - All threatened sentences and court rulings to the contrary, drivers on numerous illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets continue gas: In the last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal drivers in the south-west.
There are no comparisons for the previous years, but the breeders are doing more work for the judicial authorities: in 2018, the state prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim conducted 155 investigations for illegal races, one year later there were 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
In the race, there were fewer organized events, as the Ministry of the Interior responded to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers were spontaneous or they would have taken the flight before the police - this is also shown as an illegal race.
The tax was mainly for German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 Penalties - 15 times imprisonment
In only a few cases, the breeders are acquired and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 sentences have been pronounced.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal authors is actually increasing.
Many other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the various tragic accidents and processes of the past years and showed more frequent, said a ministry speaker.
Especially popular in Rasern is the highway 8. Car drivers always brake off the traffic there to make room and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were acquired near Kirchheim under a teck, three months before there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Marklingen.
A81 is the most popular race track
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a tempolimite, the breeders are tried to break through the particularly affected section between branches and geisingen.
Most of the high-priced sports and luxury carooses often have Swiss flags, because the drivers have to leave the race to Germany due to the high penalties for too fast driving and drivers in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the Tempolimit cannot be reduced to a few routes: "With a general Tempolimit of 130 hours we would create this problem on highways from the body," says Martin River, the transport experts of the SPD-Landtags faction.
"The obstacle wave for breeders would be significantly higher if you weren't here and there still legally with 200 hours and more on the way."
From lighting or image campaigns, the Rivoire is less: "He who, in this way, moves over all the rules and not only his own life, but also the life of other road users, is hardly yet attainable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
On the other hand, the ADAC is not enough: "We assume that the racers are not afraid of the tempolimits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also more stringent controls on the affected routes.
Not often, from the high-speed force fairs are more painful and more serious: since January 2019 and by April 2020, three people have died in the race, two of which have not participated in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's downtown town and one in Gerlingen.
There two young men were supposed to have delivered an author in November.
One of the vehicles came down from the street, collapsed against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old companion died.
21 other people have been injured in the race of the past two years.
However, sharper penalties are not necessary in the view of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "The legislative need to sanction illegal motor vehicles is not seen," says the Ministry of Interior paper.

Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "s scene"
The officers included good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, budgeted by the police.
However, only a small part of the residents of the "autoposer" and Tuning Scenes were assigned.
Apparently, the majority of the scene in question came to the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on the spot, it is important to take account of the fact that this was mainly the case.
In addition, the majority of those present remained in the current rules on protection of infection, in particular the compliance with minimum standards and the wearing of oral nasal protection.
The on-site control measures were completed at 1:00 p.m.

Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No author
There were no illegal authors.

The Agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the company involved: "They have all the beautiful fields that we must not discount," Schrödinger said.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company should be careful not to cause any damage.
"The young people are supposed to keep their cars undamaged."
Number of working agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Labour Agency (BA) claims that about 900 suspicious cases are involved in abuse of short-term wages.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have shown short work," said the board responsible for the business Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter General Zeitung".
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis many companies had suddenly applied for short work, the BA had to react quickly.
The test usually takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
So much more precisely, we're going to look at the conclusions.
I'm sure there'll be a few more.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvent wave in autumn.
"Is there much more insolvency than in the previous year?
The estimates go together, but we are fighting for the case and we are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
Still, the numbers were incomplete, Terzenbach said.

The Red Devils secured the third table by a 2:0 (0:0) – success against the direct competitors Leicester City on the final game day of the Premier League.
The Foxes now have to meet the Europa League because FC Chelsea was still passing through and also qualified as the fourth for the King's class.
In the struggle against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to rejoice.
Manchester United went through a sentence by Bruno Fernandes (71 minutes) in leadership.
After a red card for Leicester City in the play time Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to an end.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eight final opponent of the FC Bayern, won Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Walkers.
"That means a lot to me," said Coach Frank Lampard, who is also standing in the finals of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea Coach.
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, Tottenham Hotspur also took advantage of, with a thin 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace, still crossing the Wolves and starting as a sixth in Europe League.
Aston Villa decided the remote duel with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for itself, but had to spend a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately left Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough, because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club that missed three coaches in the season rises after five years of first league.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2.1) at FC Everton.
One point was missing at the end.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English master since the end of June, secured itself with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 numerators are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klop and his team just missed the score code in English football.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divoc Orgi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) turned the party on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an exceptional season," Torschütze van Dijk said after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
At the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even an early interruption or release of the remaining games was discussed on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be played without special events at the end - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against the leader of Netanyahus government are becoming more and more violent.
In the night there were violent clashes.
On Sunday night in Jerusalem, the Israeli police marched violently against participants in a demonstration against the legally conservative chief Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for taking part in unrest, police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld told him.
The police set up water heaters, among other things, to solve the news.
Overall, about 6,000 people gathered in the vicinity of Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening after media reports.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's dealings with the Corona crisis.
The Protestants blew drums, broke in horns, and called Netanyahu to retreat.
It was also that participants in a counter-test were arrested, who supported Netanyahu, reported the news page "ynet".
In many other places, people in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of having sprayed from a driving car Pepperspray on demonstrators on the street.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protestor in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured on his neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the Head of Government.
The latter also criticised Netanyahu for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he will be given early locks and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the economy of the country difficult.
The unemployment rate was at last more than 20 per cent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel has recently risen to new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter forces on car - nine injured - Ruhrde - Bild.de
Ahlen - An incident on Saturday afternoon at B58 at Ahlen called for nine minor injuries.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3,5) towards Beckum.
The police said, "Perhaps she had suddenly stopped because she wanted to turn off."
That must have been the driver of a Mercedes transporter who was driving behind her, perhaps too late.
He hit the back of the car.
In the case of the accident, three seats were easily damaged in the car and six in the carrier.
Several rescue cars took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea controls the border city after Corona suspected
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own measures to defend the Corona virus.
Now for the first time, the country reports a suspicion.
Because of a first official coronation suspect in the country, North Korea has completely destroyed a major city in fear of a disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological resistance in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been dragged into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency situation has been suspended.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspect were confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the affected country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection, according to its own data, and described its resistance as "lighting success".
The data were dubious abroad.
The disease symptoms were reported by a "outer" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person has moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and most likely military buffer zone, there was first no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea's military, however, has reportedly removed the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There were studies with some people.
North Korea called its own statements on Saturday because of the suspicion of an emergency meeting of the Labour Party Police Office under the chairmanship of Powerhaber Kim Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already arranged as a preventive measure on Friday to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every area and region from others", it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had contacted her, were placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party will therefore examine the "outbreak" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose severe penalties.
In Kaesong, about 300,000 people live according to estimates.
Tension before the Council: City-East and noise protection are still at large summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the body will also vote on the construction plan for the major urban development project," it is more appropriate in the middle of the city press release for the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of CongressCentrums Pforzheim.
In particular, the evaluation of the eastern city will be discussed until the end of the controversy.
The majority are hardly, lastly, even denying in individual committees according to presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which is out of citizenship and then a project developed by the administration and community, has not now lost preparation after almost ten years, criticised project opponents Reinhard Klein as "out of-parliamentary opposition", "unawareness", "speculation", "refuse" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks it's better to know," said Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim list of citizens for a year.
In fact, after reading the Treaties in this position, he said, "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit will make the city cheaper, the technical council is opposed to the city administration's claims for grants, the existence of which is unlikely to heal for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently when forecasting from the economy in the Council and from the sponsors.
The city was designed by its own power and not by an investor: that was its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejected the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially the renovation of the Technical Councilhouse, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller urban transformation in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a central role
In addition, especially environmental issues will play a central role.
In this way, the municipality will vote, among other things, on the noise plan.
This includes a number of measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise loads caused by road traffic, including numerous temperature reductions.
In a press release, the German transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city were not innocent of having to do so because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise, as the VCD said.
The municipality also agrees on the involvement of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parents' contributions to the city's children's day-care facilities and the application for admission to the federal Smart City Foundation.
Citizens are welcome, but they have to approve Corona protection measures.
With much delay Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
With almost half a year's delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his first season in ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the supersport car league can take up the regular operation, the first test rides were stopped.
For Zimmermann, it was particularly important to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premieres in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the preseason," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS you have to go to the curves, for example.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his first 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Netherlands has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges with it," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand us blindly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also draw his first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supersport cars will be raced by the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newlings, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the route a little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passports that you need to meet optimally to be fast."
As soon as the roomman is real, that's what happens in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little with the tests," he says.
"In conclusion, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tight-pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races are taking place.
The momentary state is that no viewer will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring Ex-Form-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will reach the GT link.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantene Decision
The decision of the British government to put Spanish holidayers under quarantine for two weeks after their return, according to press reports, has been cold to the Minister of Transport of the country.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Because of the Corona numbers again rising in Spain, the cabinet in London split the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine.
The new rules apply today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to return to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rules apply to those who are only on the day of the holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and were not introduced overnight.
Spain is still considered to be one of the "safer countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in the past that there is a possibility that a quarantine for vacationers in Spain will be closed," said Labour Commissioner Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to say Grant Shapp's message."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona situation in Spain and the outbreak of the severe outbreaks, the number of infections in the country is increasing again.
In particular, virologists make nightlife responsible for the new spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in Britain.
The British government is currently recommending non-necessary trips to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of British vacationers who are particularly popular with canaries and balearies.
So far, more than 272,000 infections have been reported with the new Corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships

The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal objectives.
The president, who himself even sailed with a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleets of the largest country of the earth.
Russia has a coastal area as large as any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, Putin said on the day celebrated by Matrosen.
At many other Russian coastal sites, the sea forces begin the day of the Marine with parades.
In Syria, where Russia fights on the side of Powerhaber Baschar al-Assad, the military demonstrated at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus Stronge.
There was also ammunition fired.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defense, not only were warships, including a U-boat, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help for Corona Hard

Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Centre of the U.S. Climate Agency NOAA announced at night on Sunday (place time).
Governor Greg Abbott called the emergency for many areas.
The coronary pandemic in Texas makes the work of the helper difficult, Abbott continued, according to US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every Hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to Houston Chronicle.
With a view to the whirlwind storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and will be reinforced if you think that it is caught by an area that is the most heavily affected area of the state of Covid-19".
According to Johns Hopkins University, some 5,000 people have died alone in Texas as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not miss practice, "on which we have become accustomed", such as wearing masks, the Governor said according to the CBS transmitter.
It was important that all the distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, Corona should be tested in emergency cases.
Damages were first reported only from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Retrieval of storm warning
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" according to government data on the island of Padre Island was immediately struck on the ground in front of the Texas coast.
The tropical storm was previously one of the lowest levels for Hurricane Hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first issued and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a decrease, while "Hanna" continued to move to the interior of the country and to the north-east of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific Hurricane "Douglas" was on Sunday night with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour towards Hawaii.
The Hurricane Centre, however, expected him to slow down further.
According to the forecast, it should be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (place time) - then as a storm just below the Hurricane Cloud.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an over-active Hurricane season this year, after a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, it was estimated that up to ten hurricanes could become very severe storms, the authorities had explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which are developing into storms of great strength.
In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which an average even ten percent, was then called.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was watching the storms and was in contact with the states concerned.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for Double-Siege FC Bayern with a relapse.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Midfield Chief Joshua Kimmich, has to show up for the third most minutes of use, suffers a gang injury at the left foot roots and threatens to be missing in decisive royal-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddel Weather, the lawyer broke off a training game and was driven from the square with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted tribal player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
An effort in the eight-final game against FC Chelsea on 8 August may be difficult, and the 24-year-olds will be able to hope for a final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.

We want to win, create good conditions and think of trust with a good game," asked Flick.

31 Players he welcomed on the Säbener Street, including the new players for the award-winning Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the spot for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy's got a good fit, like all the new ones," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. can't just coach anymore, Flick spoke much better about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, it is now being trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are unlike the Flick ensemble in the playhythms.
After that, the Munichs could face a quarter-final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals are possible opponents of Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin.

Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was at Stephen Colbert's famous latenight show by video chat to the guest, and she gave in the interview what she had in her head at her encounter with Donald Trump.
Weather by climate change Greta Thunberg was per video switch to guest in a popular US-Latenight show.
She told, among other things, of her struggle against the mighty of the world.
Also about her famous "bad view" at her encounter with Donald Trump, the teenager spoke.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to her tireless use of the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Lateight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and conducted a longer interview with Sweden.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the mighty of the world.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to turn the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"All from organized hate campaigns to threats, only because a group of children are going on the street" she experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians who ridicule them in social media or even try to silence them, they find themselves "lucky" because they show their reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed on a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look at the US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed across the Atlantic, its powerful view of the cameras has been captured and seen by countless people on the Internet since.
The short clip created a GIF, that is, an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump generators.
But what did 17-year-olds think about the U.S. president at the time?
Stephen Colbert’s relatively open question answered only briefly and dryly: “To be honest, I don’t think that need any further explanation.”
With the successful response, the experienced Satirik Colbert probably did not count and disappeared briefly from the picture.
With her "How there you?" talk about the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a backtrack: After a rash climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steep mountain and then slowly up again.
Now the bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult followers: The co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in bed at the age of 73, family members said on Saturday in an official opinion, another opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton valued Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
The fighter Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had established the longest legendary band in London in 1967, until today unforgettable is his dreamal instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is just a backtrack.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest success then without it.
There should have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted all the winnings of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide walls and with a large crucifix.
Psychiatric problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The Bluesrock guitarist was involved in drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographs reported.
For a long time Green was treated in the psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the screen.
He was to live on the street on time, working as a peacekeeper and spending a long time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
As a young man, he was fascinated by American blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
When he was 11 years old, he learned the first guitars.
At the age of 15, the teen began playing professional guitar and got five years later the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Louners.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreaker colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green protected the group in winter 1968/69 and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed his shadow pages: Green did not force the media, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
The life between music and search he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
By the end of the decade Green achieved a surprising success with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swims without it in a new formation on a successful wave.
Her 1977 album "rumours" was sold worldwide more than 40 million times.
Despite various small solo success, Green did not achieve any greater comeback until in 1996 he began again with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
Free of drugs Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blue legend - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
