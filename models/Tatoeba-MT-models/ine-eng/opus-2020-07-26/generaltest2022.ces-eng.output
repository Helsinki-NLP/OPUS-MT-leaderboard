The great return of the Czech smurf is coming.
Pavel French was invited to NHL
Czech hockey barrister Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, returns to NHL.
A 40-year-old stepparent will be at the bar and he could get to the whites soon.
An ex-contractor of Lithuania, Plzno or Russian Čeljabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Right in the middle of the race with Vegas and since then, he hasn't been present in NHL locks yet.
The incident occurred at a time when the experienced farmer moved from one point to another.
"Paul French will be injured in the lower part of the body in about three to four weeks," the general of Denver announced in early October.
His return to the branch in NHL was finally extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was summoned from a farm where he picked up four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded 94,5% of the progress.
The pulsary hockey player finally wants to move in and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had problems with his jaws and in the short-term pandemic year he didn't get a single stroke.
In the NHL, France received 36 matches, the success of which is 92,3 %.
Charles, on Christmas wish, has Camille the rosary, William and Kate set up in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife, Kate, as this year's Christmas wish, chose a family photograph taken during the trip to Jordan.
He also announced his wish to Prince Charles, who used the photograph on which Camille's car on the docks helped to plant a chicken.
On her website, the British BBC news station reported on this.
They send wishes to their friends, to their colleagues and to the hopes they cooperate with.
Photographs were produced anywhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in the khaka color and dress has Princess Charlotte as well.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same thing as Prince George and Louis shorts and a shirt.
Who ordered the photograph, William and Kate didn't take it, it's not even clear when it came.
Last year the royal family for the photo intended as a holiday wish invited the package of straw before a pile of wood in its rural settlement in Norfolk County.
The image that serves as a Christmas wish was also published by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught him in June at the ascots.
Charles, who has a cylindrical head and a pink face, helps Camille put on her pink with bright clothes.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbro a million for the title, Durdík rejected it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the fact that the former head of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr had a promised million crowns from Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server of this efotbal.cz by getting to the part of the police records.
The chairman of the performance of the top club Jaroslav Tvrdík stated that no corruption proceedings were allowed in June.
The server published a review of the police's replies, in which she is mainly represented by her former sports director Jan Nezmar, who finished his summer in the Master's Club.
Some influential red-headed official was in frequent contact with Berbre, as was the former sports director of the Roman Rogoz diocese, who was also in charge of the accused.
The criminals reportedly worked with the information that Slavia Berbro promised her a financial reward when she got a title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that, for the win in the league, Roman (Berbr) should have a promised million payment from officials of SK Slavia Praha, quoted the server from the list.
The day later, according to criminals, Berbr met with Nezmar not only, but also with the chairman of the administration of Slavia Durdík.
The file on the server is no longer valid if the police are still handling this information.
The fortress rejected any corrupt conduct.
In 2015 to 2017 we actively sought to change the dimensions of Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never been allowed to engage in illegal proceedings, have not tried to influence judges in opposition to fair play rules, and have not given anyone any financial performance in this regard," the Report List said.
In envoys other than Nezmar, some former players of the glory of darkness and also speak of their former head, the Durdík.
The cause of the alleged impact of the battles by the judges has launched a police raid on several places in mid-October, including the Prague seat FAČR.
The highest in the affair is Berbr, which no longer appears in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like some sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, he was released from the bond.
The helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
They'll be making new, but in principle worse type (the shooters have to wear the straps manually without covering).
Car - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Freight trucks and various tankers - at a decent level, in addition, Prague V3S has managed to get rid of even in specialized units.
Aeroplanes: combat- listen, but at the end of the rent, transport - very small with a short flow, but modern.
Drony - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have anything (but we manufacture and export abroad)
PVO: medium-sized, ageing; short reach - good, modern, relatively good number.
I've got a story like that.
I've got Honitbu right next to the city.
There were nutrients from the river, and they were doing crop damage, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a brothel, so I sat down quietly and the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something went out, but of course the fox went in a minute.
I let her come at 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked up, had his head on all sides, so I called him that it was on the shelf.
Before I got off the property, he was gone.
And the loca man is a prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a conspiracy of a lot of chance to happen, you'd probably be seeing in the thermovision that he has today almost everyone.
So in a visible place, dear things go to your feet and you should be okay.
The armies versus Hamaček.
Inside, the fans received significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for buying and distributing chickens, masks and fans for the profession closest to coronavir, has issued billions of crowns on their devices in the past weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts on the mirror were down to hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which offices were treated economically?
And why did the others buy the fence?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to the editor of the iRozhlas Dominik Kubisht server.
I respect soldiers and armies (almost I am not impressed by the memories of the ČSLA, which have been defeated by the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We don't even have a large stock of techniques that the training can grasp, we don't actually have modern techniques or for current professionals, and modern technology is getting more and more complicated, so storage capacity will be lost quickly in time.
To this modern conventional conflict, where one can put it, they'll play very fast, they won't have time for someone to practice again.
Finally, depositors/territorial defences are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where they are going to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also an expression of the need to frighten the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will take place only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity where the guerrillas will be irrelevant, and we have no proper geography.
Mostly we don't have an individual skill.
It's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then put in a situation like you're looking at a guy who didn't hit the empty gate two minutes ago, he's going to attack himself between two or even three Swiss people, and you're saying, "Tvl and what do you think's going to happen now?"
Of course they'll choose him as the average taxpayer.
This situation with this understanding of "behave a defender" is so terrible that I've come to the conclusion that I'm truly surprised when I see that our attacker managed to win one of the players.
First own funds
The covid pandemic slows down, but experts for the following weeks don't expect any major return.
Efforts in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and have reached the pandemic equation, as we know, a new unknown: the variant of micron, which is very likely to spread faster than the present ruling Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of action, the extent to which it helps to treat the disease or the post-infectious immunity obtained from previous treatment.
However, an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the plus side also came into the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, antiviroticum molnupiravir, has been introduced in Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and its associated hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by paxlovid from Pfizer, which from today's results is a success of up to 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupyravira to Česka, however, apart from the hope of extending the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronary pandemic, also raised the question of how the administration is prepared for the future of the medicine.
As it has been said, the first to receive molnupiravir from Merck will be given to foreign patients.
The company ended up in the band as the first one because the medicine began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find appropriate treatment for viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
In this research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often warned.
are generally less open and are not openly sharing their views.
That's why Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "how our teeth have grown".
See, you do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
Most people in the Czech Republic will tell you no.
In the West, they tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and choose sides like AFD.
They're afraid of canceling culture, saying this to the public means losing their job and the media link.
Then it looks nice in the research, good west, bad exit.
But he'll really find out what people think.
They are only in France Le Penová and Zemmoura, both of which have a survey of more than 20%.
We even know that objects are identical in Czech.
Identical for unit rotation, so that soldiers don't have to learn where they are again, so all objects on the bench are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of Brdy, and the two remaining are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the ssr didn't want to have a nuclear head on its own, either for safety or speed, for reasons of western position.
In these underground roofs (there are two in each apple) only the heads were preserved, not all the rockets as they are called.
If it was necessary to put this weapon in place, a special unit came to pick up this head and mounted it on some portable device.
Besides the museum apple, the rest are in a desolating state.
At the second grade in elementary school, we had a partner of Cighan, and we were with him for four years.
He was all right, he made good jokes, often when he showed up too much, but it was our mascot.
He was dealing with everyone, he often walked and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he walked regularly, he was involved in sports with us, he didn't steal candles, and he didn't steal phones, he was just wearing clothes.
He also drove to schools in the countryside, made a variety of monkeys, but he was fine, maybe there was never a gap.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the roommates, the gypsies to the same year, the other classes.
In a short time, they lost their teacher, they often solved a police situation, threatened and threatened other students.
I personally sometimes sell something to an advertisement (old stuff I don't need, etc.) and I've sold it to the Cigans often, the money they've always had, they haven't tried to pull me into the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, a guy called in a month ago that he already rewritten it.
I'm saying to myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone's white, black, yellow, blue or any other, as long as they act as they do in a decent society (working, working, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he's pulling his hand, he's building houses and houses, he's just messing around, he's making trouble... so it's kind of my color, but I'm gonna care.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be here as well.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prague
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, unfortunately, despite the resurgence of her injuries on the ground," said Law spokesperson for Jutchen health rescuers Zuzana Fajtlová.
Havarai probably blamed the driver who took the girl.
Eighteen-year-old vehicle driver Peugeot was probably heading from the village of Zíchovec to the village of Bavrov and from undetected reasons he went in the opposite direction.
After the crash, Škodou Octavia finished the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside the vehicle, described the accident of the Yugoslav police spokesman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugat driver suffered a very serious injury during the accident.
It was a multiple injury, and it was locked in the car.
After his release, he had to be given acute pre-patient care and in a stable condition he was transported by plane to a Czech Buddhist hospital, found to be the lifeguard of Fajtlová.
She added that a man from the second car suffered a slight chest injury and was transferred to a hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide data
Lucas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's getting his pick-up cards.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars higher where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," the collector approaches.
Since October, he has had a slight increase in the ordering of small consignments, has to add VAT again and then transfer the data to the customs office.
He will receive an e-mail stating that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is sufficient to complete the data on the sender, and if VAT has not included the trader at the time of the sale, the customs office shall measure it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
Where the addressee does not provide a customs procedure on its own, the total amount must also be added to the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Lucas Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna call one or two pulleys, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's mostly a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoother.
Due to the new customs rules, he reduced the daily number of consignments received from abroad from 60 thousand to 15,000 in international mail in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, it is also a problem that people do not respond to the demands for the supply of data necessary to complete customs procedures.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments to international mails that we need to process.
If people were to fill out all the data they need and fill it out in time, so we would be about half here, the Czech spokesman Matyás Vitík tells us.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you propose solutions to current inflation?
Currently, we are 9.9% inflation and expect further growth.
What do you think should be done to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We need to see in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this your way?
What do you think happens that's inevitable with where it works?
Prices are rising faster than payments, I believe it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I have been added 2% in the rough this year, which is a joke, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I operate in the workplace.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstratively testifying to violence is being sent to the network for only six months?
This head just doesn't take me how the court can only send a six-month-old animal out of the net just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months are nothing compared to his/her victim's trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships in general.
And don't talk about the victim of rape ever having to remember.
Doesn't this even allow a potential future report of victim rape?
A man from the tomb "lost" his friend from Kostomlat
A man from the tomb reluctantly helped the guards to secure his nationwide looking for a friend from Kostomlat, on whom a warrant was issued for arrest.
He called them to him himself.
He went to it with his eyelids.
First, he spoke up and made up his story that he was stolen.
After the press call, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "stealed" told them that he had made up his mind to get the officers to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officials on how to report to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a state search, and a warrant was issued to her to be arrested.
That's why the case solves the PPR.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slovenian?
I personally believe that we are no longer ethnic or cultural, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the member, of course, that it is a pity that Churchill failed to ensure the release of Prague USA :')
Of course I don't deny that we have a Slovenian language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
Here with Pascal I can't agree, there's a gap in the world if I don't get confused, something like ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god is a man to choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in some of those thousands of religions there is at least one God who will not punish you if you believe in the god of another.
Even in the wilderness there is no God but Jehovah.
Would it not, then, be more rational to hold faith in any god than to risk choosing wrong from those thousands of gods and the one true God I just didn't see, send me to hell or somewhere like that?
Other: Voluntary training with the following classification in reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a professional offer.
All ACHR files would be like that.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can say this: There is a constant preference for cooperation between the education sector and industry, for companies hunting in schools, and for some kind of procrastination, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only when we're growing up, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another.
Similar strangulation should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see this as a way of building a relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or possibly the Mongolian driver will never get out of here again.
I find it funny that you think NATO is something that's stuck in a rock, we have allies, and they'll defend us if it comes to a crackdown.
Well, you'll be happy.
There's only one election in the United States that's gonna break their budget and the whole NATO is going to be a chicken.
The English exchange us for Russian money, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Polish have once again shown themselves enough to show back and take what they want.
The only thing that has long served as a guarantee of independence is an armed army and a population that can control military technology of its own time.
And today he can pilot the remote control devices of every teenager, so it doesn't work.
We don't need a border fence, it's bullshit today, but a saved teenager behind a tight remote controlled device will be able to handle it.
How to avoid boxing
You're gonna clear the presents under the Christmas tree and all of a sudden, you're at home packing boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack the packaging materials.
This is why a map of the shops that your used boxes welcome.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like one-way waste.
Anyone may, after agreement, bring to the store involved (the KAMsNIM.cz project directory contains 150) cartons, plastic or paper covers.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated, and avoid overloaded blue containers.
The individual shops welcome packages that are currently on the market and also saved money, as the last-period package has saved 50 %.
In the eyes of environmentally minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One of these is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of drugs and cosmetics.
However, the boxes and the filling material we are carrying to Poprovek near Brno are inviting individuals who gather at home, and the companies with whom we have a regular link of the deposited cartons.
We'll use everything when we're packing the shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to another generation, says Petra Lopušníková of Tierra.
The application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows, however, not only the pick-up places on the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to remove the sorted waste from the household, where to deliver past medicines, tyres, served electricity, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end in the right place, as well as reusable things will find their second home.
The entire project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
“The collection halls, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPYs and other places that help to find uses for things that would otherwise become unnecessary” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the company Clean Czech Republic.
I'm going to feel worse that today's technology is so simple and silly that kids using a computer or a phone play on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem (mainly in English articles) arose that students of high school do not understand the principle of computer content.
Because you need Google Photos or Apple applications on photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide this underlying file system with files and everything is found on one screen in the application.
Let them use the techniques from childhood, but especially learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU – starting in January – before the weekend, and it was great.
Macron spoke over the hour during which he opened the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they could not be reached in half a year.
French politicians like that, but they like it and they like voters.
Macron's right- and left-wing promotions agree on a small scale, but that's what Europe does.
And in France, there will be a new election to the state's head in April.
The election calendar also influenced priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is prepared to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators have immediately come up with criticism that Macron is about pro-European propaganda and rewrites history.
In fact, he's trying to defend his history more than that.
The country's right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmmour is now surrounded by France, saying that the regime of Vichy, who was working with Hitler in World War II, was not so bad, and it is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one textbook and let's not look at what happened in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story of ours, and never as a story of it as a whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs know who defeated him in a battle.
But if they don't have a bright office, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech Mouse didn't win.
The story that returns to the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica also gained recognition for the regime and for the best actress Jasnu Duričić.
This year's Karlovary Festival was held at the first corners of the playboard.
The best player in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the movie Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy/fit and I'm not infected.
It was cca as "to have a flu/to be pushed" for a couple of days I had a break and I didn't have the taste of smoking...
It was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have a break in the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying it's everyone's got it.)
Christmas Book Types
The Christmas double number, which will expire on 20 December, will contain a traditional literary annex.
And there'll be cultural tips with her.
The books to you, prepaid, are also adding to this digital edition so that you may have enough time to arrange books as Christmas gifts.
Prosaic texts that refer to the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of the world's observation and description of all things with unparalleled curiosity, deep and atmosphere.
In his second release, the photographer Sixtak tried to capture the essence of small town and Czech society.
A report on the return to the roots that can only be extracted from the illusions.
The Bohemian and comparator conveys the story of the Red Carcule into the sphere of the present village.
Its use of brutality overcomes the human version and evaporates in the horror of emotion.
And the fact that the way back to the instincts is shorter than a person's willingness to admit
The author in his last novel will report a rather less sentimental story about the return from emigration than we used to listen to.
Those who stay, and those who leave, know too little about themselves to spend it on a common life.
Trains start driving according to the new driving order, somewhere change carriers
From Sunday they start riding trains on the railway according to the new schedule.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some tracks, such as between Ústí nad Lab and Kolín, where the Czech Dragons place begins to drive RegioJet.
For most lines, only the departure time, if any, will be adjusted slightly and their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the rails.
The truck sales started in the autumn.
The Czech routes plan to operate on a daily basis in the new driving order of 6783 personal transport connections, of which they will be on a daily basis of 478 distance trains.
Trains will be sailing in the new order of about 118 million miles [ 118 million km].
Roads along national connections under the new driving order will also drive to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with a new schedule, will set up dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains that will drive on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will travel to North Moravia or Western Czech Republic.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the fare prices from next year, which is on average 3.2 percent.
The routes take into account inflation in their tariffs each year.
The biggest change in the region is the entry on the R23 Ústí nad Labe – Mělník – Nymburg – Kolín.
The carrier here, after success in the Ministry of Transport competition, will replace the Czech Railways.
Every day, RegioJet will make a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped from Sunday at Havlíčkův Brod, Žjár nad Sázavo and Kolín stations.
Leo Express maintained his 16 connections, two back connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakov.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier also tried to maintain as much as the most similar driving times of its remote trains as planned.
Without major changes, the operation of the trains of Arriva and other carriers should continue.
The carrier shall also be exchanged in some regional routes.
For example, the changes are waiting for passengers on the Českolipsk, where on the route from Mladé Boleslavi through the Czech Lip to Rumburk will be the place of the Czech Dragons to drive the trains of the German company Trilex Die Länderbahn.
Travelers will also be able to use a single train ride in the second year.
Like the Czech Dragons, their price increases by 3.2 percent.
I don't have to agree.
Aren't we learning the other side's view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed, and how they had to fight, they died.
In my life, I haven't heard from the employer's side or from that time, nobody defends this, just judging it.
No one will tell you at school that blacks often sold to the blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they'll just tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans have been killing each other, and they've killed each other a long time ago.
I spent some time in the United States, just in schools, both in the North and in the South.
I haven't met with anyone deliberately silenced the facts, but I've heard it's happening before, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (maybe in Japan there are monsters from the WW2 quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without regard for the matter from that time on.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we're in those southern states, yes, the federal flag and the famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, and they had some good luck and I found it absurd to end them.
Moreover, the North wasn't much better than it is being idealized by a lot of people today.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in the South were slaves and quite opposed to them.
This I would not compare with Russia, they deliberately ignore some facts, lie and manipulate, and we must also not have our views on them (there was a video on YT on TV, where someone who started talking about our Legionaries and 1968 was released).
What happened to me at the US schools was the rise in Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country never experienced.
In general, I found it amazing at some universities, these students were pretty radicalized and those schools supported them in how many times.
And if I imagine these people will be much older once, I'm a little upset that this could be the voice of the majority, because they're between the young and the ruling elite.
I think maybe feminism has already achieved what he had, and it's not about the same, he's radicalized.
At present, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, have also led to radicalisation on the contrary, often leading to resistance and quite reasonable things.
The more someone's more radical, the more they hear it.
Anyway, I also didn't see anyone judging me as colonialism or slavery.
I met with the wrong geography, but it was both sides :D
Not because I wouldn't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
In addition, the concept of nationality is generally considered to be unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If I'm so interested in people, looking at the world and sharing experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic fernities, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovenian.
That Slovenian pharaoh is a very nice guy, he's more of a theologian than a politician, but then he's always screwing up some coronavir chicken that everybody's ashamed of.
Then, of course, there's a Czech-Slovenian Hussetian Church here.
They're officially Protestants, but they're actually born of Catholic modern and are actually Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they're going to go to the Husites, because it's theologically very similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalistic temple on the street of Botanicka.
Otherwise the church of St. Michael in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they make Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts took it from Austria
Brèclav — A flame blessed in Bethlehem, where, according to the Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Sketches for him because of the kronavir pandemic, but they didn't even go to Vienna this time, they took it from their Austrian colleagues to the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav in the morning.
They picked her up at the border last year.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate with each year, I look forward to it.
It's an honor for me to have been chosen, she told the present reporters, Amálie Budíkov.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly at the border bridge, now at the Rhinetal-Břeclav crossing at the parking lot.
Usually for him, but he's on a train to Vienna.
There is no change to the divorce of the flame after the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, they made their way back to Brno, where they gave it to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Circlem.
On Saturday, December 18th, the next distribution of the light will take care of shelling couriers who will travel by selected fasts and personal trains.
They will take the light from them in the local Scouts or volunteers who will then continue to spread the flames throughout the Czech Republic and where the wheels do not drive.
This year, however, it is necessary to comply with the applicable measures against the spread of coronavir.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the local action organizers to, of course, wear gloves, try to keep the breaks, they were at least not singing to colleagues, they were just acting so as to be the safest, they wrote the verbal actions of the Bethlehem light Zuzan Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem's light, which travels to Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread at the same time with the flame of the thought of peace, friendship and peace.
Bethlehem light is for a believing symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, shoes and shoes have been trying to spread it for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of insanity and human relationships.

I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that grants are economic cancer, but I don't think that grants as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education makes good use of the money, even though I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies as a whole.
As mentioned, it produces an excess product and penetrates the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where millions of graduates are "xy funded/co-financed by the xy project" and such a company is just artificially held in life.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to people, this is the acceleration of development when this company keeps and kills contracts/employees to companies that could grow and become more productive after its collapse
It's an absolute agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes a person who was born online also gets caught up in a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think the Internet ads don't work with me, but then I guess they've affected me, too - it's just so crazy that you don't always stand up for it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a complete programme ban (= targeted) to advertising...
It's all bullshit, classic words - I'd ban those internets.
I have a feeling of this virus having roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that most believe and make sense, I am not a sheep, but I will rather believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion that I will claim to be a critical thought"
2. "I won't believe everything the media say"
3. "I don't believe politicians"
TVs have dropped the trend of Christmas movies, and their premiere this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – China, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies and this year their viewers in the premiere represent more than two hundred.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has encouraged and significantly increased audience monitoring, so these images are produced more and more.
This year there were four times more Christmas movies than in 2011 and two times more than five years ago.
The IMDb database then included only the images that have the word Christmas in its name, so it will actually be much more Christmas movies.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, the history of this period is linked in particular to the story, the world-wide popular needs are also pictures of Sam home, Love Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas images, however, began until the year 2009 when a special film series arrived at the American cable television station Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year this station has begun its Christmas sightseeing since October 22nd and presents a total of 42 Christmas images.
The Lifetime Competition Station has 35 new Christmas-themed films this year, and they also contribute to a total of their favorite streaming platforms, such as Netflix.
“In this magic period, it does not matter so much again, it is important that there are many Christmas trees in the background and that they snow,” described this genre Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I’ll be home for Christmas Movies).
"For spectators it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the Christmas madness and madness of the world in which we have been living for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films that is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with you, but then it's about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that's going to work out and the two of you're going to get a good one.
That's how it's always around, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, will not affect the final F1 race.
At the price of Abu Kill in formula 1, only nineteen riders will appear.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on the covid-19 and will not affect the last season.
Now, Haas, they're just gonna send one formula on the line.
In the last race the season was to attack a better location from the 20th grade that he graduated from.
Rus Nikita Mazepin from the state of Haas, however, at the end of the Great price Abu Kill will not affect.
He was tested positively for covid-19.
On the starting floor, only nineteen cars will appear, from the last corner will be on the track of Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who plays with Lewis Hamilton in direct battle.
Mazepin is said to be relatively well Haas and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita's physically okay because she was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will guide the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, while security will be the final priority for all stakeholders," its representatives stated for formula1.com.
He's not going to the Haas replacement race, he can't.
A possible replacement would have to graduate from the qualifications or rides on another part of the weekend.
With the covid-19, there's no first racer.
At the very beginning of the season, the covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year, were positively tested by Sergio Pérez cz Lewis Hamilton.
They can lock you up for this, too.
And everyone's gonna be robbed of the boss's saying.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive layer is amazing!
It's a little like a portable craft and the creator put half a year of work into it and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but with little experience, the lights never carried on at home," admits Lebanon, who spent over 3,000 hours in the year.
Hedvábí bought in Italy, 24-carat gold net in France and 2000 decorated crystals added by Swarovski.
The silver stars then won 150 diamonds.
"The foundation is wool and cotton, but the silk adds a light of hecticness," the creator commends his work, which, of course, does not recommend work.
And there's another hook.
"I'm on the run, I have to sell the council as soon as possible," Lebanon admits.

The government has approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, researchers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They have to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and the construction of the planned area.
Poland has formally requested assistance from the NATO State, in relation to several months of the Belarusian regime's actions, which in its territory calls the citizens of the neighbouring countries with a false commitment to the easy crossing of the Union's borders.
In the Polish territory, British and Estonian soldiers are already active.
Mutation Omicron is spreading south of Moravia?
Hygiene's checking another case of Adam's baby.
"We have currently reported another suspicion of this option for another Adamov child, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the U.S. Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases have been reported in the country during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Flu and Non-Hydrical Sources of the State Health Institute in Prague," the Director said.
She added that it is about two nurses from one of the college hospitals Brno and two children from one of them, and two eleven-year-old students from the U.S.A. Adams.
There's no connection between Brno and Adam's cases.
According to the Director, three of them have a slight symptoms, four non-significant periods.
No one suspected of Omikron abroad
None of these were foreign nationals, nor any of their families, nor were any of those resident abroad contacted.
The relevance of the water field champion is none of those mentioned, Ciupek said.
The chief hygienic Paul Svrčina stated earlier that an international tournament in the water field was being checked in Brno several weeks ago.
There were players from the South African Republic on it, and one Belgian player got sick after returning.
California limits arms sales.
He wants to act like Texas when he's not about to lose.
The Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the Americas by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of the heart rate of the embryo.
People would then claim compensation for anyone who manufactures or sells firearms and firearms in California.
Newsoma's announcement responded to the Friday opinion of the US Supreme Court, which left a texa ban on abortion in force, though it was against an old previous verdict of almost 50 years, which set the right to abortion in the whole of the United States by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now decided on the constitution of the entire law, but on the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the prohibition was transferred to the public, which prevented the Texa Republicans from attacking it by ordinary judicial procedure.
"I was arrested yesterday by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which permitted the maintenance of a texasic ban on most transit services and strongly supported the Texas manoeuvre in order to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If now States can block the review of their laws by federal courts, California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
His subordinates believed that in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, they would work on measures that would justify the public representative in order to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called spirit weapons.
This is the case in the case of handguns which do not have serial numbers and which may be used for the treatment of regulation.
Newsom wants to have the right to claim at least $10 000 (over 220,000 CZK) and judicial expenses from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell offensive rifles in California, parts of the "arms of spirits" or plants for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets, create a threat to private complaints, then we should do it exactly," the California governor said.
The AP submits that, decades after California had banned the production and sale of certain military-style weapons, in June, but the federal judge now blocked the ban as anti-constitutional.
Since the ban would now be indeed renewed for the use of the texas model, the words of the liberal members of the Sonii Sotomayor Supreme Court, which, in an inconsistent opinion, warned the majority of Friday's verdict against the extension of the legal mechanism to other American States, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity to the Texa ban against judicial review and allowed the trial clinics to continue in appeals against the selected South American State.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the treatment scheme will look like and also comes to improve the vaccine itself, based on the results.
A study of the effects of 4 doses is already in progress from Israel.
And according to these studies, in most patients there are up to five-fold increases in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect.
Just like any other estimation will have after the time of its healing scheme, it's just too soon for it.
Another reason is that a new vaccine should soon be placed on the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer’s specification, promises up to 10x greater efficacy.

I think O2 is offering the League of Masters, but I don't want to change TV and Internet providers.
Poland threatened to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act against the law if it exercised new powers and, for the sake of the rule of law, stopped the payment of Poland's money.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the allocation of EUR 36 billion from the EU fund for the recovery of the economy affected by the covid-19 pandemics.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to proceed further and use a mechanism to recover EU grants to countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU hearing on its own in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the leader of the small side of Solidárni Poland, whose current government would lose a close majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable in view of the fact that the EU is unlawfully rebuffing us from the common budget to which we are also contributing, the Polish minister added.
His party to the EU takes a more radical position than the ruling party to the Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has made to Ziobro's actions threaten its independence and undermine its independence to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels builds "the impossible conditions because its objective is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces "the political dictatorship of the extermination and attempts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on the partnership of the sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never join such a position in Brussels, which would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree with Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But getting to know each other... we have one type of cheese in four different places in Lidla.
I didn't look for other things, one yogurt I met again and again, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes in milk rules, and I quit, and I asked.
They had him, it's true, in that narrow sector, all of them were chosen, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the green and the unlactose zone...
If the escape is no longer in the market, and I don't want to go into any more action, the gold cow in the square, they don't have that choice, but most of them have everything I need and they have some order, so I have ten minutes of cash.
To Lidla to take a vacation.
And I don't care.
For two years, I've been watching how data is stored here as a nest, most of those who refuse to do so are just a little bit more out of the month than most of those who do.

It's always from the wall to the wall.

Fuj, that's how I got caught.
I'm sorry for the trip and wish you all a nice day.
When I was a kid, I had a cook.
It was never because of signs, it was mostly because I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (I read instead of going to sleep, washed with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I've never been tortured without warning, my mom always threatened to do it once again, so I'll get hurt (sometimes even after another "stretching" just brought in and laid so I can see it).
Just after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on my ass (through the dress).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because a child reacts to them much more than words.
I believe that this part of warning is important because it gives the child his choice of whether he will not listen or get better or not.
After all, I had only enough warning to start listening.
Protection of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and Constitutional Judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered the press question, what the Czech institution means to him – if the sacred paper that he swears to and which he learns from at school or the agreement that can be amended if necessary, he was definitely in favour of the first concept.
Once in the constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are and who we are, and the changes are better to save.
And imagine: Some peoples even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like peacocks with pork and celery, he voted for the question of Vojtě Cepl.
In recent times, however, there has been a growing awareness among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
The summers were tested by situations that its creators (who belonged to Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, for example, the conduct of the elected president.
In one thing, Cepl was right.
All we know about such documents is that political inputs into their texts must be thought out.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, but then it can be a key to managing most of the crises that companies face in contrast to history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a system of governance consisting of the individual rules that govern politicians to maintain the game.
We fear that a lot will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we link policies to prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno, they fight for the life of a few months-old baby
Although it is known that coronavirus is milder for children, there are also difficult cases with which hospitals are dealing mainly in recent times.
"We know that children are threatened and affected less than adults, they are 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik University of Masaryk, a primary of the Children's Anesthesia and Resuscitation Clinic.
The process is much simpler, easier, often without signs.
But there are children who are with coronary disease, which we see particularly in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need little support.
She's in the clinics of child infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavir are up to the ARU lately.
Children with post-conservative syndromes were separated by a doctor continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute malignant pneumonia, which means the inflammation of the lungs, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects adults as well as a few months of babies.
In hospitals there are also children in severe conditions due to coronavir.
"At the present time, we have a child of several months and a teenager," the prime minister said.
It is, however, a pleasure that FN Brno, in the infant hospital, has so far not recorded any infant deaths.
According to available data, six children between 0 and 14 years of age died in the PRC on 6 December.
According to Dominika, there is an integral part of the co-operation of a psychologist in a children's hospital – not just in the coronavir department.
At the same time, it also points to the fact that both adults and children are expected to slow down the course of the disease and at the same time lower the incidence of post-covidal syndrome.
“This is why we recommend the treatment for children,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on designated roads.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They are seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don’t cross the field).
Skiing/driving in the woods outside the marked roads must not be allowed unless you have an exception (but of course it is not very careful outside the national park).
How's the conductor?
Music is in my head, laughing at Josef Kurfiřt.
It's a remote liberal opera and it was originally playing on a wooden corner.
As a singer, he can sing practically every repertoire and as a conductor acting not only in the liberal divadle F. Šaldy, but also in the Plzni, in the divadle of Josef Kajetán Tyla.
It cooperates with garden philharmonic, film philharmonic, or with a subkronous symphonic orchestra.
China builds the notion of a controlled disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China builds a sense of the disease control and the fact that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has become a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticizing him for not being able to stop the plague that has changed into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in infected.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protection aid and Chinese doctors are often helping in the fight against coronavir, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do you do the Beijing will?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend will meet a friend and tell him, "Don't you want an elephant?"
I got it and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the grass, washes the car, plays with the kids.
Well, it's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Comrade, I'm gonna cry, it's gonna be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought them complains: "Wow, what did you sell for an elephant?"???
He's a deer, he's got a big shit, he's got a car, kids are afraid of him, and his wife wants to get divorced.
What he said is, you're not talking about an elephant, so you're not selling an elephant...
The world's actions are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is precisely the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can become such a power only if it works for its integration.
It is still functioning at the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but still lacks military integration.
I personally think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century there'll be other moods and it's going to happen.
I've been thinking about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on honesty, so maybe I'm talking.
All I'm saying is that most of the ellipse includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and Mandarins", when it is clear that it is both from Spain, which in the "Spanish fruit and Mandarins" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I believe that the phrase "all American forces" means, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in this broad concept and there is no need to specify it further by the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just talking :D
Whether it's like that or not, it's a pointless requirement.
In Tokyo there was an earthquake of five degrees.
Japan's Tokyo metropolis and the surrounding area struck an earthquake of 5,0 degrees on Sunday.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey Cosman Milly
Scary recordings show the moment when the frightened monkey scurried in the toilet month before her insensitive owner scurried and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkeys also fed the park, kebab and hamburgers, regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwenta has now for life banned cattle, informed the Journal of The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitating monkeys who care about Milly after her invasion have declared that they have never seen such a frightened cosmonaut.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she is again happy playing with another saved monkey named Moon.
The four-year-old mother has confessed to two charges for causing unnecessary suffering to the protected animal.
In the Magistrate Court in Gwenta, she was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment with a conditional deferral for one year.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has received a life ban on animal breeding and has to pay in the calculation of 12,000 crowns of judicial costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the beloved animal, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She screamed and hid herself before anyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled and satisfied with the male, she can still cause panic in the eyes of new people.
Psychic scars from the twisting will carry it forever, says Sawyer.
Milly's raid came out after the police in Gwenta discovered terrible shots in a woman's phone after a raid in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly snitching on the tapes.
The next video is how the Dutch monkey offers cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So give me the oil.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to holding cocaine with a view to selling it.
In her home, there were 1,600 pounds of cocaine (over 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Children’s Eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts do you learn from this fairy tale three times after you've been firmly skipping the whole 20th century?
Like you're gonna take the same stuff in the championship as in the sixth grade?
And all of this kills the idea of bifling when no one, the honor of exception, doesn't matter whether you can or do it.
Write a test on 1 and then no one cares.
Go and on the street, people happen to ask whether to control the nature of the roots of the quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the absolute majority don't even get sick and tell you they're in a drink.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of a general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that point, it's unnecessary and you'll never get it to them anyway.
It's part of learning for a lot of people who will need it.
But like, the note that you don't really need all of this to stand by your machines, I mean, seriously... because you just don't need it.
Plus, we're getting a little slow until we don't know what a punk mark is.
(In which we are likely to share our Communist past and reproach against the students and elites) Of course, the price that barbarians will make is simply high for us in these machines.
If journalists were to be able to count, then here the coward probably never got these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: The War of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave immediately," answered Andrea on the Instagram in Stories on all sorts of questions of curious fans, which made her so disappointed at Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even lock him up on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrew, it's been tied from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, at least until she got back to Czech.
But she totally refused.
And as you can see, not only did he not end love but he grew up to hate each other.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri's turn in reaction to Andre's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's ex-wife was no longer in love with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stop her brother in public.
I don't normally express myself to such a thing, and we've never even said very extra things in our family.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But if I see someone who's trying to hurt the public and spray the name of someone I love so much, I just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I would like to thank my brother Kadrim this publicly for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most even when we were young.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such false information that is probably quite out of context.
I'd love everyone to know Kadri like me, our loved ones and our family, standing up in response to Andrey's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and we know how it really was, add to it.
The drunk thief went through the façade until the fifth floor.
You don't believe it for what.
He started his robbery at the parking lot in the residential district, where he was trying to get into several cars.
According to the information available, he finally depreciated the total of 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he didn't think anything better than to jump to the 5th floor and enter the apartment with an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
Then he's caught on the camera from one security camera, leaving the street from the crime scene and eating bananas.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found out the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
The next one was Cchaa.
The man admitted that he drank some alcohol on the day of the crime.
And since he needed money, he decided to steal in his drunken state.
The whole thing's been under investigation.
The drinker went through the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and activity bound to the Pandemic emergency.
If it's canceled, the law won't be effective.
The law, however, restricts the scope of the business
Is that not enough for you?
The right to collect will be limited, but never cancelled.
In the Saturday elections, four communities received more than 60 percent of the volunteers
New representatives of the people elected on Saturday in the villages of Komňa na Uherskohradiškska, Lužice na Mostecka, Nova Ves na Liberecka and in Equalna na Pelhrimovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the number of elected representatives has fallen.
Of the total 28 candidates, 99 candidates were saved on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69, the youngest of 33.
The preparation of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to the General Representatives and, above all, very closely followed elections to the Chamber of Ambassadors, ČSû Mayor Eva Krumpová stated.
She recalled that due to the epidemic of covid-19, the choice of equipment and personal security was more demanding.
In the Chamber in Uherskhradišk, the Saturday election of the Association of Independent Candidates won 27.76 per cent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-year term.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 per cent of the votes, which also means the win of two mandates.
Two seats in the representative’s chair were also won by the Citizens for the Komhn, and their voice gave them 18.52 percent of the volunteers.
Once again, they were re-elected by the current mayor of Jan Krzyzková, who is a member of the Privates.
For one term of office, the Komjáns – independent candidates – achieved.
75.48 percent of legitimate volunteers came to the polls.
In the village of Ravná na Pelhřimovska won the Pro Ravn Association.
50.50 percent of the vote, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2.
The election rate was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lužica in Mosttecka again won the Association of Lužice and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
56.73 per cent of the votes were taken and four mandates were held in the seven-year term of office, as in 2018.
The second ended the Grand Prix candidate for the people who voted 43,27 per cent of the vote, so that three representatives would be represented.
Seventy-sixty-seven percent of the volunteers went to the urn.
Elections in New All in Liberec have won independent candidates Hope for New Ves before the U.N. Movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of the voters voted and thus gained four seats in the seven-year general representation.
The UN received 40.12 per cent of the vote and against the appropriate elections in 2018 increased, gained more and has three.
The election was 42.9 percent of the volunteers.
The results of the elections shall be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday.
Then they'll be published in the Law Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign policy?
I think you know everything people write here.
You're just playing stupid to have someone "to guess" with.
If not, it's sad.
I don't claim that Christians are degenerates or anything.
I even like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was finally the goal to look good).
And I don't care who believes in it.
On the other hand, I am concerned about how much the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money she had buried, how much science, and so on.
Don't talk about all the wars she's caused, like those three years.
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but state and church don't have anything to do together
The man fell his head down 12 meters.
The attack on concrete survived.
The incredible fall survived Sunday night in Ostrava, where the rescuers of the National Health Service were involved.
The workers of the Regional Operations Centre took over an hour after Saturday afternoon the pressure call with initial information about the fall of a man from above.
Two ZZS - medical and medical staff were immediately released.
Upon arrival, the doctors found that a 17 - year - old man was supposed to fall out of a window about 20 feet [12 m] high and hit his head on concrete!
There was coal in the Vitkovics.
But not the way it should be, and the fires went into action.
At the time of the arrival of rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intubating doctor intubated his breathing pathways, provided artificial lung ventilation, and after other measures in the context of pre-patient emergency care, her health vehicle moved to another care of the island traumatological centre, informed the speaker ZZS MS region, Lukas Humpl.
I'm more concerned than with coronavir than with inadequate public and public responses.
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, in the first line of the fight against disease, but it is primarily for doctors and medical personnel.
How serious is their situation?
We're asking military doctor David Rezactor.

Legendary Nunes after seven years fell, Oliveira defended the passport
MMA experienced a great gala night full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, things were done.
Outsider Julianna Peň has been able to defeat the legendary winner of Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found the winner in seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light bond, presented a great frenzy against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly broke Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
His opponent also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise nobody expected.
That's what brought the women's battalion weights between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Peny.
The American entered a mutual battle as a mental "trap", Nunes did not lose his seven years and brush his teeth at another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes had started the road after the victory very actively and the opponent even saved the push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, the money did not make any further mistakes and failed to attempt to attack on her hands with a knife.
The second round was touching and very tense for MMA fans.
Both rivals were honored with many outstanding punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Nunes got her on the ground where she started to scratch her.
She had to give up her efforts and turn off the attack.
That's how the American made a big shock when she became a new champion.
The summit of the gala was a battle between Charles Oliveiro and Dustin Poirier on the title in a light vase.
In the beginning, however, Poirier was better off, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he was trying to be more active in Oliverira, who the opponent tried to shake his hand.
He did not succeed, but then he created a lot of pressure, got a rival on his back, and fell asleep in a series of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked shock, which Poirier had a moment of excitement, but subsequently he had to sneeze off.
So the Brazilian defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, he won the sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who first placed himself on Rauliana Paiv's right back.
Next, he received a number of precisely targeted hits and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to consult Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years lost.
The hook, or the hook?
At first glance, there's nothing complicated about it.
Most of the main names in Czech only express one grammar family, and therefore it is not a problem to determine whether it is a male, female or middle family.
But then there is also a relatively large number of major names in which the family is not established.
Such important names are intertwined between two kinds.
At the time of the landing, they acquire two limbs and, in some cases, remain in a state of ill will.
For example, the words “swiss” or “swiss” are the family of the male and the female, in the first they bow according to the pattern “machine”, in the second according to the pattern “song”.
For other groups of major names, different forms are already in the first fall of the single number, i.e. ‘line/line’, ‘kedluben/kedlubna’ or ‘brambor/brambor’ (in terms of food).
Both forms are then written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as "kurka" in Czech Republic and "kurk" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-written, similar to the other Czech-Morivian two words: "kurk" and "kurk", "kurk" and "kowl" etc.
Some words that came into the Czech language from other languages were initially inconceivable, but gradually they came to the Czech connotations.
A typical example is the term “image”, which is a family of both men and women, or the word “bufet”, which remained in the middle of the line, but in the male, it has the finals according to the pattern “city”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like directly on the Greek border?
On the Greek-Turkish border, tension is being felt by the growing number of migrants who are trying to move on to Europe.
Thousands of people began publishing after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, humanitarian aid to the Czech government too.
What really motivates refugees to go the wrong way?
And how does the situation look right on the scene?
We haven't seen the blue sky in three months, and we've been breathing, describes a reporter from Sydney.
Nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals have been killed by the fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month, and millions of hectares of land have been destroyed.
How do the authorities and the residents of the city deal with the threat?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent the drastic effects of the criticism?
And what will the country have to prepare for the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Iko Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why it's always written all over the place.
For people, it's an unpleasant solution to how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so try to talk about it.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how they often treat people around them or the police.
The victims should always be trusted.
The trend was that the victims finally opened up about their traumas.
It's still a lot of people leave it to themselves.
Yes, they'll find someone who's guilty of a false charge.
It's disgusting and spitting into the face of all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "a large part of the charge is meant" and that it's "trend" you help only sex offenders.
Czechs flood houses, families don't have money to finish
Building materials prices in recent weeks and months have increased by more than 30 percent.
A lot of people got into a new situation because of that.
It does not have the means to complete settled family homes, and the banks refuse to raise mortgage loans.
In addition to the prices of the materials, the price of construction works is also increased.
That's why people don't have enough money to complete a family house that's already settled.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to uninhabited and uninhabited homes.
In the worst case, unoccupied houses are unoccupied, and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rent for it," says BHS Economist Štěpán Křeček.
In a year, we will build two to three family homes, and at 50 percent we will.
For us as a construction company, it's hard to keep certain things to ourselves, even though the material has been stored.
So we're doing without a profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivon.
A lot of people will only have financial problems.
If they calculated that the building of the house is going to be five million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Sliven added.
Most of the materials have been researched for copper, iron and also for installation and heating equipment.
But construction companies are also fighting a lack of workforce.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of the construction sector are missing and foreign workers are forced to stop the pandemic.
It is more favourable at this time only to the situation regarding the issue of building permits.
"In October, the construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits, which is almost 10% more than a year ago," Kreček explained.
We're good and we'll get even better.
Real vision but missing, says ČRO commentor – mujRozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the entry into the new year has been traditionally carried out by politicians.
This year, apart from the Prime Minister and the presidents of the ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman and the President of the Senate and the Embassy, spoke to the nation.
What do we know about the principle?
As in it, I've got my own theme that I've chosen, I've got the baccalaureate, I've always been working on it for a whole year, and then I'll write a written part in two weeks.
The states are completely at peace with us if a man is not a complete macaw and something is left in his head, then the commission will not push him to the theory.
I must have been studying at the statehouse for a week, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical departures that I liked right away and I was right.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to make the semi-annual project for them (we did it many times, really beneficial, much learning) and then only learn the project and have it grown.
I think it's great when, at the end of the subject, there's a test that shows the knowledge acquired within the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't charge emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be just like them.
Those people in the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But by the way, you can build a similar statue of Putin next to Pú's bees.
You should give her another way to match Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artists under his feet.
As soon as you don't make a story every day and at least every other day a new picture, your accomplishments are reduced to a total minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function, whether a liek, comment or deposit.
I've been really shitting myself lately, so maybe I'm going to have to cut myself to the point where a lot of artists from my industry are successful and they don't let that happen.
Finally, I'd like to know if there's any user hotter that doesn't exploit all creativity and energy from artists.
Declaration by the Donbase Party
Swazu – yes, break-up – no, they express their view on the picture of the opposition of the break-up of the SSSR.
Thirty years since the unlawful break-in of the USSR.
On 8 December 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuskevic, without any legal authority and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open-ended attitude of Michaila S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "Svaz Svaz is an subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
One tiny pen was "cut off" to a vast country with nearly three million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens were displaced abroad.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the Russian population has decreased by between ten million and eleven million.
And regardless of the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the past 70 years at one session in the White Forest have betrayed a socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Civil War).
They have, of course, implemented deindustrialization, prevented agriculture, removed from the world's largest power, the fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked in the single mechanism.
If we want to see even deeper, then we see the deterioration of the population, the collapse of the economy, the sciences, the armies, the growth of crime, the inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-world space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in politics as "vacuum force".
Everything that has been quickly hurt and given up has quickly been completed and gained by NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And today the whole world is shocked by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover does not have to correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by giving it to the fridge and making it Thursday night.
In the alternative reality, in which I don't buy this meat on Monday, it's in the autumn chain to 99 Kč / kg - write me a mechanism that will change its prices because of my system of living?
And either I'm waiting for Thursday and this meat will be lit 1 day before the date of consumption at 69 Kč / kg - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday at 120 Kč train and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I'll answer it myself - nothing.
These craps about if something's cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, damaged or unqualityd are terribly retarded to tell you the truth;-)
Now I've been to Brno at the head of the house, and the ladies in the basement have been giving me a brochure, like, always taking things to help the brigades, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of village intelligence and conservative views of the world's functioning, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be such an agit.
After reading it, I found someone who was publishing it, and finally science came out of it.
Well, like it was a good mother, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
The damage to the paper, because of this, would not have caused the casket to be washed.
I've had something like this with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional exaggeration make you make this person speak out because you like him without realizing how much in the p*part of this situation is.
She threatened me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to see out.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment before she broke up and asked me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
Cca year was a great relationship, but then he ran for another half year and started kicking her on the thumb.
Then I ended the relationship with the one I told her I was leaving and lying to her, but I could talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch some ammo again.
Such a person brings out feelings, emotions, and total joy.
I'd rather keep the distance.
When the insurance companies steal out of here by buying dark tests and hunting for positives that wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we achieve is the complication for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the generator of random numbers have fallen into five days of domestic prison.
In the West, they've already stopped with the witch, and they've recognized that there's no price to deal with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new and has to steal something else and drive the ego by thinking of bubbling.
I see we're back in the old good shit.
After a few years of humour and oppression of this innocent business, the MLM recruiting returns to the broadcast.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, champion at VS), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to be interested in it, mostly getting people."
I was honestly interested in the products I was offering, because I wanted to help people, but training was more about how to scare and infuse people.
When the first money was made, a person quickly realized that if he wanted to make it, he had to chew several certain products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable thing, so then a person felt like a underground salesman.
What I can say is that the experience was valuable, a person learned that he should not jump at every point and check the information carefully.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw all of them into one mess.
People in this business are successful and even successful, but they will certainly not praise themselves with expensive consumer goods or a "good" account.
In the corporation where I'm doing a lot of these things, I didn't live up to it.
The HR is calm, the managers are looking at their management, and they don't have much to do with us.
Regular evaluation, then, in the form that this is going on with us is quite going on (set some goals for next year, we'll see what went on and what didn't) - it's more self-esteem than someone would value you according to some numbers, and so on.
The company's actions are also not mandatory.
But we're also a little bit isolated within our company - there's a department that's more "corporative".
Sometimes a person feels that we're such a short-startup that squashes in the offices of the big corporation no.
But it doesn't work that way until the results.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days the British police have been looking for the missing 32-year-old Czech police who have lost themselves at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the Jakub Kulhanek demise on social networks that a woman from Uherkohradiška was found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police have confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that the body of the missing Czech citizens has been found.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In view of the family, we will not be giving more information to the case.
An honest condolences, he put on Twitter Kulhanek.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on the 28th of November on her way from work, before she had to pick up the money from the ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by workmates five days later.
Next, the London police raided her, Interpol classified her among the wrong people all over the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police in this regard have kept one man a few days ago.
What he had to do with his role and what he suspected, but did not disclose it.
In four municipalities, new representations were given at the end of the year.
On Saturday, December 11, the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiškska, Lužice in Mostecka, Nova Ves in Liberecka and Ravná in Pelhrimovska chose new representations.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the number of elected representatives has fallen.
At the 28th term of office, 99 valid candidates were held in the new elections.
The electoral participation reached 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Levelna, where 93.62% of eligible volunteers were elected.
A total of 8 women and 20 men received the warrant.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidates were registered for new elections in the four municipalities.
Of the 28 deputy posts 36 women and 63 men were detained.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, 72 years old.
The preparation of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
There have been four new or repeated elections to the General Representatives and, above all, very followed elections to the Embassy.
At the same time, we had to work mostly on more demanding epidemiological conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personal security, Eva Krump, the 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 3:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote shall be published by the State Electoral Commission and shall be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a completely dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning of the day, it took a while, but it went without the bigger backbones.
To deal with how idiotic a large part of the population is building on all its layers, I have a problem with it so far.
I'm looking forward to it (to-morrow!) because it finally makes me less dependent on the fact that other people aren't shit.
He would be relieved of the President's duties and the ability to recapture her.
The chance that it really comes to that, but it's like the rest of us are talking about a lot of things here.
Besides, I'm not sure if the corpused writing would even be considered a magnificence.
Velezrada is an act that threatens the President of the Republic's sovereignty, territorial integrity or the democratic nature of the state.
It must have been more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: Increased numbers of people up to 35 years who are without sex all year
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
This is mainly about religious-based people, the dailyMail web site.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of young people who claim to be sexually active rose from eight to 21 percent.
A woman between the ages of 18 and 35 who stated that she had no sexual intercourse in recent years is more than ever before.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, as shown by the study of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic effects of the coronavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of the media, social networks or video games that make young people less and less priority could also contribute.
"From 2010, the share of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 is growing rapidly, indicating that they had no sex in the previous year," said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% in 2021 stating that they were sexless in the last year.
Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
Then, too, fear of premarital contact and religious foundation contribute to sexual activity.
Although the likelihood of sexual activity, the percentage of married and married couples 35 years of age still declines.
Young people share an opinion on premarital sex, about 30% think he's wrong, while about 70% think he's okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are minority, but their behavior changes this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarriage, religion is the reason.
Since 2008, for free people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60 %.
Among the "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the reduction of sexual activity, such as less social interaction and mainly alcohol abuse during the pandemic.
The study also showed that sex is less likely for people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which is likely to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, and this need is “recorded”.
This trend was mainly caught in lockdown at the time of the kronavir pandemic.
The whole arrangement for vaccination against covid is whether the company should bring part of the population to the behavior that they do not want, but which can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question that I'm personally interested in the question of social consciousness.
For example, the question is, if we don't do it to them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly die for an 80-year-old who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he listened to some disinformation, and as a result he didn't have to look at it and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can die of a strong rebuff of harassment, which on the side of the SPD and the KSCH are exaggerating something about the reproach and totalitarian state.
Of the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unforeseeable pensioners are likely to belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do so themselves.
Czech without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up in a dry fight?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snow resorts in the Czech Republic for the last time.
Operators of ski areas will not pass without technical snow, weather also complicates the preparation of the Jizera paddle.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight dry in Czech?
I should have a story, but it's not about a pancake.
Once on high school, the teacher led us across the city on the boat so that we could get a project on the ships along the river.
On the way there we went once such a broad street and whom we probably don't see in the middle - the stairs of the sect of Hare Krišna.
Of course, they fell on us.
I'm lucky I ran away, but with one friend, they got into a conversation.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she answered.
All of us, including the teachers, have been laughing all the way to the shipyard.
We're in a lot of confusion.
Not so much, but the system is already playing, says Orosovich
The new German office of Olaf Scholz, after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed her with military direction.
"We are opening up a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the discussion.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly state that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders, is, according to the Chancellor, a solution to the use of diplomatic negotiations, which is also within the framework of the "Normandian groups", which unite France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the office about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexandr Lukashenko has artificially triggered a migration crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, because at night we record hundreds of attempts at (unlawful) crossing borders.
He talked to the office about further sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and his patrons in Kremlin finally understood that we were determined to prevent the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, ensured that Warsaw was pleased with German support in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the Dutch conduct of the Lukashenko regime with its runners.
The drunk Polish helicopter was guilty of an accident, trying to keep it secret.
After a while the car returned to the scene of the accident, the car was driving another jeep who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could get a driver's license because of the lack of advantage in the car and the arrest of the accident, she came out with the truth, introduced the TVN24.
She admitted that she found another nun in the vehicle who asked her for help.
Then the cops came for Celestine's sister.
She was subjected to respiratory tests and was immediately given a driver’s license in her blood.
At the same time, she was informed that she would be brought before the court for her actions.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Yuri Shammovich didn't stop his film.
The Czech family comedians were watching American fairy tales.
But they forgot the essential thing about it: the laws of the movie novel.
After the film F. Brabce Gump - dog that taught people to live, we now have another video about the dramatic emotion in the movies here we watch.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovic ml. freely influences his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On the scene, a talking lunatic of Hugo and some famous characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the forest pension, who's coming along, and so they start calling him a poet, Julie's father with a partner and mostly her daughter, Veronica.
She's not a little girl anymore, she's a teenage girl who's been living her first love.
Director with partner Beatriz Shajmovic (which is also a producer of the film) have been dealing with the reporting procedures already in the previous dog video, but there were at least children and dogs.
This time, she wrote an even weaker script to create a mixture of surprises and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's cut it down.
Julie, as a scientist, is concerned about the child’s dark disorder and, if the correct “constellations” comes, he gathers with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined – on the cape of a car or church tower (especially during a journey with a local guide), the distinguished Colonel Momír, despite his flying training, is shot in the forest by his own daughter (Julia), who will fall into a coma, which the family is taken by the hospital in order to play in the heart of the forest alone a miraculous process of dog healing.
Nothing against the clean treatment of nature and the strength of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, dreads what a huge pemmel of an incredible situation and the figure was needed for this message.
Two thieves from staff, dog competition, forest charlatan, police coming to the event to look for "drugs" and discussing the ingredients of the stinking strength of bone marrow – and which the family in the pension drinks of course.
When the hero comes out after a heavy coma, and the return seat is loaded and lit with a cigarette at the family table and requires the father’s whiskey and dishes to be treated with vegetarians, it cannot be denied.
Navrch is still viewers who explain that "sometimes it's becoming a comet."
Sheimovic's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of text work, the ability to build a bear situation, a sense of character and point and direction.
The heretic performances are unbalanced, a piece of workless and total feeling punctuated.
Whatever Lukas Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to get their party up, they don't have enough to play.
The only piece of film remains the poetic footage of the forest cameraman Vladimir Holomk and two riders.
It is not enough to plan a number of characters, a four - story puzzle, and a dog’s songs, but the more human vulgar expressions that the characters allow.
The argument is not even a summer member of the Horsemen's Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and friendship a person with a dog must also be knowledge of crafts if a person wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't happen in this case.
There's a little bit of eroticity and a minimum sense for the genre.
Even as an ad in cannabis therapy, this amateur-acquired piece wouldn't go through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to all the stuff from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and pushing, here's how you fucking understand that, but that's just because you never tried.
The decision is always on the customer if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you had listened to such a joke, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case, a brigade for an award.
Near the east is usually dry for months.
Winter is the only time in the year when it rains.
"The complete absence of hits during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long - term strike average in November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been a long time.
It's also the right Christmas scene, the Nazarta resident was delighted with Vasim Ashkar.
The strikes in Israel come only in the winter months, are offensive and irregular.
In the winter rains there are dependent forests.
Without them, they're begging, and they're prone to fire.
It's not just about forests, it's also about drinking water supplies, and I'm gonna blow it up for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, this year, thanks to the last three rainy winters, it filled the region.
Since then, the levels have been falling.
Water companies have been warning against drought a long time ago.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a drop in rainfall here,” said an Israeli Water Agency spokesman Uri Schor in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as waste water disposal or recycling.
The worst are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the main city of Jordan, Amman, there are tanker cars.
Water and private wells dry.
"This year I received orders of seventy-eight percent compared to two previous years," Imád Sulejman, a tanker driver, reported in September.
In Iran's Isfahan, there was a gap between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The waterless river of Coryto was completely free of water.
The region's got the dryest November in the last many years.
Israel prepares a military attack against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister declared that the dialogue in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and that he informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military attack on Iran, Jonathan Lis informs.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to put their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them".
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I had a little bit of puke when I was in the interview to find out what she wanted me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these subspecies, so I've had some more doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
Tell me I'm in danger, but pyramid is pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisers.
On the weekend, the skiers went out to the mountains, waiting for a lot of snow and good weather.
The Czech mountain centre experienced this weekend's first major effort by skiers.
After excellent snowing at the end of the week, it is not about snowing, and some skiers started operating.
The host did not fulfil the obligation to demonstrate himself in the tugs with a covid certificate.
While trekkers do not complain about the interests of customers, some ski equipment loans report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
In the run-up, thousands of people in the Liberian country were even present at the meetings.
The skiers wanted the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are calm, this opening weekend has really come out of Friday evening skiing, when we had on the hill of the first skier," said Jeszted Jakub Hanush, director of the Sports Area.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseneniks for their first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the centre in Branná na Schumpersk had been opened.
The weekend visit was very good, and 400 people were expected on Saturday.
The conditions are met.
Today the sun shined, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, he did not observe the glory of the representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Passázka.
Skiareal operators may only sell ships to people who are infected or are within the period following the diagnosis of covid-19.
When people are prepared for the exceptions and proof of the necessary evidence, CZK René Hrones from Špindler’s Mlýn ski center said.
"We've only recorded incident units," he added.
Lower interest than in front of the pandemic is reported by some skiers and skiers.
The interest in lending is lucky.
It's not like last year, but it's still a lot of customers, led by Alexandra Bokish from the opava store Skiopava.
More effort is expected during ski courses.
Also, the director of Snowbear David Shinták's royal household feels that because of the covid, it is not about lending ski equipment such an interest as before.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost disbursed.
On the contrary, the period before the pandemic was about 50 percent, the CHK Shinták said.
According to him, the people with the pandemic were lenient and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded in the Novako area on God’s Daru.
With the loan of the skis there started a week ago, and the interested people have to order them first.
"We start to borrow trains this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect great interest, just like last year," said the operator of the Pavlín Novaková area.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also seen as a ski school.
If we want success and wealth not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health, where it is often not possible to obtain a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There's a lot of smart people going abroad who don't have any property.
The owner of the company abroad is not going to leave.
But I agree with the rest.
Unless these people live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began by winning Orbán one day, ruling the year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that from day to day the PRC can not feel in a similar position.
The next question is no choice at all.
If he's gonna live here, he can win some traditional V4 nut.
Young people and education will leave, their supporters and people whose property is not to be taken to the plane.
It's a scary picture!
Longmayer in the blood because of a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic it was the full course of the autumn, in Thailand the staff of the film Ostrov in front of Jiři Langmayer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor on social networks published a blood photo of his face.
Is it a real injury, or is it a film show?
The London police are still searching for the unwarranted Czech.
She was last watched on the way home.
"The disappearance of Peter does not like her behavior and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor in a Saturday video from the police department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also worried about her, and she wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman said on Sunday 28 November around 19:45 left work and headed home to the quarter of Camberwell.
Last time she was supposed to be on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on 3 December by one of her collaborators.
According to British media, the heart rate was "assistant of nurses" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital's Guy's and St Thomas' Association.
"We have an unrelenting concern about our dear colleague Peter, who is not aware," a group of medical devices stated in a Twitter contribution.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her to contact the police," the announcement continued.
The public also calls for Ms Harriet Harman, who pointed out the Srcvo case at the press conference on Saturday.
"She's been unconscious for a few days, she's only 32 years, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are of course for the death of the establishment," said a laborist politician, holding a photograph of the woman by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her, because she was outside her home country, leaving the family and working here for our health," Harman said.
The police had already kept a man in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information on his identity or what man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
That's not how I underestimate Ukraine.
It's not "a huge amount," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine constantly repeats the threat of Invasion and begins to have our entrance full of teeth.
I quoted it upstairs.
I don't know what you thought the Russian war was about.
The war is a hell of a joke and Russia has HDP Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is beyond so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare it to the first Punsk war and "an annex" sycilia :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with agreements from Minsk, Russia is investigating those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" on the borders would match.
Ono, I'm a servant of the covenant...
New driving rules apply in Prague since Sunday, mainly to urban connections
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which relate in particular to urban connections.
New lines have emerged, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is again involved in the integrated system.
In the main city from Sunday they stop fast from the Czech Budějovic in the Zagradní City station.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains will be driven on the route from Beroon to the Czech Brod through Prague’s main station.
In the recently run Prague-Zagradně town station, the R17 fast will stop again from the Czech Budějovic and Benešova.
The PID is being extended to other areas.
Among other things, the buses will go to the Light beyond Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Old Splavů and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavska will be included, including lines with crossings to the Liberian and Královéhradeck region.
77 lines, 37 new lines are introduced for integration and the operation will be adjusted to 12 functional ones.
From Prague, Zlicín will take out a new 405 bus line that will go to Jatce.
A new direct connection was also created by Prague – Kralovice at Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened in the early peak and in the weekend the connection from Prague to Rakovník, when the new express line number 404 will be issued.
Newly included in the PID are lines 400 and 410 driving to the Liberian country.
They're leaving the Střížkov metro station, not the Holesovice Station.
The 400 parent line goes through Mělník, Dubo and Czech Lip to New Bor and the selected links continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimon and Jablonný in Podješdá.
On the contrary, a new operation is cancelled or restricted on dozens of medieval local routes, including Mochov, Dobříše or Rožmital under Tremšin.
All trains leaving Prague were cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernization of the railways, long-term restrictions continue on the tracks of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Lab and around Kolín.
Changes are waiting for passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the line 420 from the Dobříše with the port of Prague, where it is possible to use the PID to Milevska.
The routes between 540 and 543 in Nymburska were changed and the routes of some buses on the border of central Czech Republic and Horovick in the Plzeńsk region are adjusted.
Healthy kitchen/dining in a supermarket office
Hi, I'm doing classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option where to get food is to go next to Billy or a bit further to Lidla.
Because I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'm going to buy as fast as possible a pizza ground and a yogurt and apple sauce.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat adjustments would you recommend buying in the supermarket?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately they are.
And it's not about trees you need to see.
Only a tree tip can be hidden under the snow.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more prone to fungal disease.
I don't say that's the only reason they forbid us to drive outside the stable, but it's one of them.
Dary's confession of the relationship with the Negro: I'm not happy about this at all.
The Czech showbyznish fisherman since Friday is nothing but the discovery of the relationship between Dary Rollins and Pavl Nedved.
They've been pulling it together for years, and the famous footballer even let himself be divorced because of the singer.
The gift now sent to the fans a comprehensive message explaining why love has been a long half secret in front of them.
"I allow myself to claim that there is no one currently in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia who would avoid that Dara was caught by a bear, i.e. sorry, Nevida," says Dara Rollins, who is in the most successful Czech footballer in love with her ears.
I think he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are in the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And it's here.
What we both didn't enjoy, but we knew that one time it would come, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse at it.
If those who don't even care about it and jump it out of the can, or we whose lives are in deliberating.
As if one of you wanted to hear the opinion of whether you and your husband or friends are getting along enough, or you've been insisting that everyone really know the list of your former partners and be aware of the number of your mistakes and mistakes.
It's a gum, you want it, Commander Dara.
Two of them came together in Italy, where Rollins drove for the preparations of his new fashion collection.
There's still a long time out there acting as Vice President of Juventus Football Club.
The truth is, they've gone out right now, 'cause they're waiting for the Negro's divorce to be completed.
Ivan and his wife have been separated for three years, but they're not on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who are happy with us and wish us, thank you.
We're just people, we have families, children, the past and the dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have a right heart.
And that's why I love my new husband and just like him with me, I stand with him.
Hey, the other commentators have probably said it all, I'm just confirming that colleges are great at first, my associates with most during the first semester or two met and scrambling, and then we found ourselves together, which comes as my best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments don't seem to be insinuating much too long ahead, so now you probably don't get much, but looking at the offer will certainly not hurt.
Otherwise, avoid not only Ceylu, but also around (the streets such as Vranovska, French etc., it is quite a bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a bit ghetto.
On the contrary, Veveří is a lot of students, the King's field and this way it's nice, and it's close to most of the VUT faculties (I don't know exactly where you're going).
So I've never wanted to rent, but I'm a Brňák family, so I could possibly advise Brn as if you're still missing some information :)
But that's an example of a "normal" thought.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not finance enough some schools.
Whether they learn what they want and pay for it, or whether they're going by state, they'll pay for it.
However, we cannot let a private actor control the part of the school simply because a few crowns will be given to the necessary state contribution and will thus be able to teach in schools what they want.
Such a claim is somewhat lost in the case of a person who, two days ago, expressed himself as a petition for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the voice against it if someone goes to the funeral is the same as the voice against it to get some socha to stand in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already found that (and even for a long time professional) it's either kind of coming out of the eye or writing something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and in the note that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I'd be able to deal with it in some way, depending on the program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some sign database and find the nearest one.
But because it looks like you're dropping out of some book, I'd guess the author or printer just created his own sign that's sitting on what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more of an Easter kingdom (the kingdom) than OdryNská?
PSS: Someone's already broke up with you.

Politicians don't even know what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
It seems that they would approve something because no one understood a text, it's ridiculous.
All the relevant approved documents are being examined by word, but there is no basic knowledge of English, which is a matter of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and translators work, English is more suitable for informal contacts, the linkage of overstandard relations.
In addition, with English, this is quite interesting, after GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hat on Cyl.
I've been working there for the third year and all right.
How many times do I drive from work I at 10 p.m. and never a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's barely broken up in life.
Yeah, there's probably a majority of the Roman population of Brno, but the only thing they do is to stop them from walking and parking where they don't have :D is definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out there tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd go quietly.
Full of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovene (78) without Dads and beloved Gelems as a hook in the board!
Who's spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most of the people on the adventurous dam lit their first candle, Felix Slováček no.
I don't have an adjective, so there was nothing to burn.
I saw the birthday gifts, and Lucie must have had some, said the Bleska saxophoneist, who so confirmed Patras's words that he often visits her.
He's visiting, but he's not staying in their house at the Vinohradach, where Dada stayed alone after his departure.
She still doesn't know where she's going to be on Tuesday night.
We recently met with Annick, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SPOLU!
But we kept talking, so it didn't happen on Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I'm buying gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy Dad and Lucia something, maybe perfume.
I'm a gentleman, he added Felix, who himself came to cross the music video into Richman's club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I'll always find someone I like to talk to, a Slovak who was happy to meet a wife of Human Saturday Adrian or a singer of Kamil Nyvelt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford to have no soldiers and no weapons?
I doubt someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a total idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be the wrong argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other component that could be in a hospital crisis.
The police are few and they can't afford it, so firefighters and nowhere else is the high percentage of trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is capable of preventing Ostrava from going to the head of the previous government, not the army, is asking for a new toy for a long time.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a factory for food, says the journalist.
Czech Republic has been going through the worst dry season in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters were located in the mountainous and sub - mountain areas, and the smaller peaks of precipitation are also noted places where there was no need for moisture so far.
The reason for the drought in much of Central Europe is a climate change.
But the impact also strengthens the way we manage the land.
What do you want to prepare for the dry matter?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, well, I'm barely going to stick in the skunks on the ice, I'm going to know what hockey is and the tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total hall.
And whether you're a hockey team "Russia Bear" or "China Lama" you lose two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, they're different than when they're compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators who whisper, what the judges do not notice, whether it's a male or a female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian players" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And theirs if it was otherwise like it's always the same, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they won, it'd probably be classic "they've lost" over "MY we've won".
Coronavirus: The number of injuries in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily plagues.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
Overall, 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The cases confirmed in the last 14 days are 100 000 in the Czech Republic, 871 in the last week.
The number of injuries in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours 29,929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it's the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain faces a "unavoidable" large wave of infection caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on TV Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical adviser to the British Health Office.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with micron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to increase.
No one has died in the ochronium yet, but hospitalization occurs about fourteen days after the accident and about three weeks after the accident.
The chief of British laborers, Keir Starmer, observed on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently violated the law by organizing a Christmas Eve at Downing Street last December, when the lockdown was introduced and the holiday party was banned.
One of Johnson's government ministers pretended that the Quiz was "virtual" through the computer.
However, he participated in the Downing Street team of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the premier function is strong.
During last December, when a tight lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized a series of weddings in spite of lockdown.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Two years ago Boris Johnson won the jury mostly in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party says it is necessary to remove it from the Prime Minister's office.
It's remarkable how fast things have developed.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting the spring of elections that can end the twelve-year-old government of Viktor Orbán.
It will be a choice of European importance.
How can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They're probably not even free, because there weren't even the last two choices under Orbán.
His party Fidesz controls the media, alters the boundaries of electoral circles to benefit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, the last one sounds like everyone in practice can choose where they want to go.
This will allow Fides to hold voters from decided circles to those where the result is inconceivable and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It's been a long time, not if Fides wins, but how much and if he's going to have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will get united opposition.
It's for Victor Orbán and his party a big coincidence.
They won't be able to keep playing much harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
She recently fled to independent media footage by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fides László Kövér, where the heads of secret services said that the opposition was a threat to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of the news.
It's all starting with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time in 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither did I, her dad has a long time, but then she blows extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very choleric, and I grew up being a little scary, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a cricket and being completely blue, it took me about 2x under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they danced to me, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I certainly now have the tendency to deal with things with violence, as I was a little girl, now to get rid of at least one thing and as a younger parent I need to cry so much over my hand (so I don't get too much over the hold), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have the pressure.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my excitement, but I'm sure that education has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think being a child is just bad and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially at the time it wasn't "higher," but on the other hand, because of frustration, if every parent just sucks, it's probably not possible for their children not to empty out at least a little, so I don't count on them.
I don't know why the O.P. should be ashamed of anything.
The laws are to be clear and clear.
So I'd call the kundamis who make laws of that kind.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a income accident?
You can really count on people to want and buy a product and you'll have what mortgage to pay?
The cat's crazy world.
Where will Slovakia postpone the process with the killers of Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main election begins in the process with four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martiny Kušnírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She moved a civil society, but also discovered the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Kočeker and his connection to the points of Slovenian politics and justice.
How will the fundamental break be the process for Slovakia?
This is what the press can do for.
How is it possible that this petition was regularly given more media attention than the anti-pects of the dean of all medical colleges that came out two days later?
Anyway, they let themselves get fucked up, and the company jumped off.
On Czech television, she died with the baby six months ago.
The next government will end and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of warehouses nowhere
Mr. Karl Havlíčka's proposal needs to be recast in principle
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiše is at the end and the law that should ensure that the interests of the municipalities and their citizens are respected in the selection and approval of the deep storage site of highly radioactive wastes still do not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted by the government after the flight to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
However, its contents are in serious disagreement not only with the affected communities in the Platform against the Deep Storage, but also with the Swazi City and the municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect a more significant strengthening of their ability to decide on the depositary, as promised to the elderly since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its proposal for a coalition, to work together with the foreigners.
The proposal for a law by Minister Karl Havlíčka, who has the Platform available, concerns the municipality in particular: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the choice of location for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can be really effective only if the local community or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This may be ensured by the depositary's obligation to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific procedure.
The proposal for a matter of purpose almost completely ignores public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically purely statistics in the course of the recruitment procedures.
In the proposal, there is a lack of system setting of compensation for the municipality for the whole process of searching and selecting the location for the warehouse, its authorisation and operation.
The representatives of the communities really do not have the opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place to store.
Only in certain procedures may they give their comments or withdraw, however, the Authority or the Minister in whose interest they are authorised to issue them shall decide.
The complaint shall not have a consequential effect on the conduct of research or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically mature countries and certainly in those where they have already advanced to the approval of the warehouse, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, in addition to another failure of the government, which is hired by external legal offices for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, the contract is with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which has been concluded by SURAO and is related to contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánk.
The total amount for this work is to make up about 4 million crowns according to the contract register.
Antonín Seknikka, local mayor of Ceyle from the locality of Crádek and speaker Platforms against the deep depositary said: After the ministers of industry, who are balancing the position of self-government towards the state authorities when looking for a deep deposit of highly radioactive waste, we are only looking for their successors, we expect a more significant turnout from the new government.
We offer it with a hand.
We also appreciate the support of the City Council and the municipalities, which regard the problem of the lack of the rights of the municipalities in such basic buildings as the localities directly concerned.
The Platform against a Deep Store brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 companies) to introduce a change in the state's approach to fuel-fired fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not only be confined to deep storage.
The Platform further recommends that a decision on the selection of the site for storage should be conditional upon the prior approval of the municipalities concerned.
The heart of John Goodman (69) contributed to the death of fear: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change for years in his life, his doctors finally scared him.
They told him if he didn't lose, he'd die.
And that took it.
Goodman gradually weighed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun's journal.
His new position was praised in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
There's a different man from Roseanne's crowd!
John was glad that his friends and family had asked him to lose weight because his big body caused the furniture to crack.
"I've lost everything in my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in the interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, practice.
I get to the age when I can't afford to sit on the spot anymore, said for ABC Goodman, whose change is amazing.
It also depends on what boss and what you want to use the word "boss."
If it's any text on a platform that expects a reader from a gaming environment, I wouldn't have overheard it.
If it were a formal text and a university text, I'd probably be looking for a better description or an explanation.
There's more than one kind of boss for everything.
Maybe the game like Dark Souls etc. has some bosses that yeah, and so "boss" is something like a master / ruler of the level given, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are the covert bosses (super bosses, hidden bosses), who do not need to beat at all to complete the game or level, but often are even stronger than the standard bosses.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player is not running with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they're called anyway?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
It's a casually one-word translation of the boss just doesn't work, the Czech and the other languages don't solve it (you need to be just a Catalan who translates the boss as a final opponent).
It is a short story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and monitoring completion of some level or task.
After the missing Peter from London, four worlds.
The Czech police joined us.
After the missing Peter Srnc's fourth British police since 3 December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherkohradišk has been looking for her since December 7.
The Interpol is helping the British police at the same time.
Czech Peter Srnch saw her colleagues last November 28th.
The British police have been looking for her since 3 December.
The interpol gave her a so-called yellow ring.
After Peter, then, four worlds.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesman Katerín Randlová.
"We share information with the case," she added.
The reported search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 centimeters high, it is soft and has smooth eyes and long equal hair of the same color.
She's supposed to come from Uherkohradiška.
Peter worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such disappearance is very unusual for her.
After Peter's trial, she was also involved with the representative of Harriet Harman.
She joined Peter's face-up flight.
"We are very worried about it," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance of British police officers, one suspect was detained.
But it's not clear who he was talking about and what he had with Peter.
The Czech Republic is terrorising Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month with the coming year’s end of the attack significantly increased.
A big campaign in relation to Agent Tesla was on November 18th.
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
The infected Annex in the e-mail shall raise the user's attention to the name referring to payments and financial transactions.
While last month she had a dangerous annex in the name of the bill, this time she was marked as a copy of the bill repair for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Esset.
Spyware contains functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The harmful code actively searches for stored login data, which subsequently sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic in the fall of August and September and with the coming holidays and the end of the year the attackers' activity is growing again.
In November, Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November have captured more global campaigns.
Compared to the October data formbook in November slightly weakened, but still stands as a pointless five of all detections.
The attacks were carried out continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
Formbook contains the most common .exe application that has named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
The Czech Annex may then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
The significant decline and decline in activity show security analysts in the Fareit programme, which stood at 1.6 per cent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic for the last few months had no major attack campaign.
Today's smart lady who doesn't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated assholes.
The Praha pipeline was bigger than the media reported.
According to photographs of the crossing of the coast and according to my experience, the demonstrators have no fear of estimate of about 10,000 people.
The people in the pipeline filled both the bridge and the opposite coast communication.
That means people really are a lot.
As a result, about four thousand demonstrators are spontaneously added to the unknown number of roundabouts.
I'm saying there's something new born here, says Radek Wekry.
The constant dissatisfaction of several large groups or groups of people led to their finding a common word.
Only the anti-ruminants, anti-ruminants and sex... would not be able to fill in or pay for this.
The action of the Chcípl dog has a rise in popularity, which reminds me of a million moments for the democracy of the country.
Sometimes I feel like they're renting the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what a move from this dissatisfaction might be, not only depends on the move of money, but also on whether a triple Pfizer vaccine will not be four or more doses.
It's definitely not going to be left-handed or middle-aged movement, so sit down.
The triple vaccine is almost sure to become a multiple vaccine, because it's obvious that we're going to have to be overlooked every half year.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists, on which humanity is proud.
At the end of the year, Bulgaria has a new prime minister of the notifying change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has commissioned the creation of a new government by Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue in the change that won the November elections.
This has already succeeded in putting together a large coalition government that should take over the office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been taking place since April, when the previous government has lost its vote in the face of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winners of the fight against payment and abuse failed to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one looks?
The "secret" shot is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend there were concerns about the 32-year-old Czech fate, followed by four days of the London police.
Petra Srncová was last watched two weeks ago when she was driving from home to the southern British metropolis.
According to information about the child hospital's staff, she calls in addition to the police and her current employer or deputy representative of London where she lived.
"The disappearance of Peter does not like her behavior and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor in a Saturday video from the police department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also worried about her, and she wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman said on Sunday 28 November around 19:45 left work and headed home to the quarter of Camberwell.
Last time she was supposed to be on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on 3 December by one of her collaborators.
According to British media, the heart rate was "assistant of nurses" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital's Guy's and St Thomas' Association.
"We have an unrelenting concern about our dear colleague Peter, who is not aware," a group of medical devices stated in a Twitter contribution.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her to contact the police," the announcement continued.
Schupper's amateur painter of the children's rooms Zdeňka Dvořák Kocourkov (and also the country's Pirate Council) made an anonymous statement that his painting violates copyright.
The court, however, admitted that the paintings of Krttečka in the slumper-dwelling law do not violate.
In Ústí nad Laba, she wanted a month of hole in the road in the form of a channel without a roof.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the RSD that the road belonged to, and because it had not responded, the door went on.
Finally, the authorities explained their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the RSD began to "resolve the situation intensively".
