The whites: turn on a1, pony on b6, king on c8. The blacks: pony on a7 and b7, king on a8, mad on b8. The whites put the opponent in zuggzwang by playing the turn on a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the turn on a6 or move their hole to any other case of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pony from b6 to b7 and offer failure and mat. In the second situation, the whites take the black pony on a7, with the same result.
