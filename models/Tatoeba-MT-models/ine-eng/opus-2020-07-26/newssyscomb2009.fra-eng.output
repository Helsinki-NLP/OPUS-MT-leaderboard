Right populists triumph in Austria, they have 29 percent total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria have significantly weakened the two parties forming the current great coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered with particularly important losses.
On the other hand, the EU electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphal return on the political stage at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remained, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, and lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The OVP, which with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the votes, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties in the post-war war, especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, the electorate is making them appear to have let the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations regarding the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-chairman Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary board of directors of the party.
Such a change would facilitate the transition towards the outcome of the most likely election outcome, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the books (FPÖ) would have gained 18 per cent and BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that BZÖ separates itself) from a common government, which even raises sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to work with any party and that he intended to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, on this trend.
The last party to have access to Parliament is the Greens, but they have slightly lost and have fallen, amongst the Austrian political parties, from third to fifth.
Of course, no other party has the limit of four per cent and has no access to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are at risk of cooling
If the problem could not be resolved with regard to the Czech researchers accused in India of illegal cafarding, the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg would be followed by a certain cooling of the Czech-India relations.
The Minister said that today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, followed by a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, through talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the local government.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could demand bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, as a result of which he might be grateful," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Minister mentioned.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We wish above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize him," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great surprise," he said.
The Minister denied the question as to whether he had obtained from India the promise to take care of the case.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said, "only.
A Czech arbiter fights for the seabed
It approaches a walled electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he was not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the seabed adjacent.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the head of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and complete time to another.
The burning of work and enthusiasm characterizes the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms for the unknown moment, which can contain the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A Wider Background Than Earth Closes
The littoral states have begun to assimilate with the new sub-sea territories today.
According to a United Nations convention, they enjoy their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which is often extended to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
The latter may, under the Convention, apply exclusively to all resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, it is considered as a continental shelf the part of the seabed and its sub-floor, which is a natural extension of the continent below the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand seas, which represent an exclusive economy," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf should be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous cost-effective prospects and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests, those of Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned were successful," Mikulka added.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its sub-marines, has recently experienced a global decline.
New Zealand, too, has won from the territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission assigned to it last week, amounts to 1.6 million square kilometres, representing the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospect.
The benefits they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they have planned, be invaluable.
In turn, other countries will submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean background, proclaimed by the "common patrimony of humanity", begins.
There, no state no longer enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nonetheless, we don't cheat, the seabed isn't a Klondike," he says, exaggerating Director Mikulka, stating that "his areas are clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other States of the former Léster countries' bloc within the framework of the "Interoceanmetal" Joint Organisation.
This was achieved in 1991 under the Convention, as well as by investors from some other States, the status of the one called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and the Kiribati.
The area visited by the investor slightly exceeds the area of ex-Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moved there, it's kind of a submarine replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it from a range with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a rich cast in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of this.
She remembers a small apple of earth, or, with a little imagination, the mythical show, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were in place for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's assistance in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never took action.
More details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists from Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials from the federal police and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technische Hilfwerk, were on the scene of release.
As the spokesperson of the Departments communicated it on Monday night, the German forces were not finally required, the hostages who had released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the assistance provided by Germany to integrate it on-the-spot as a support force.
"It hasn't happened so far," said a spokesperson of the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers had removed in southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have, in the meantime, arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and the special forces should have withdrawn on board an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The House of Representatives of the United States refuses the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress had recently failed the savings plan for the financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was snoring in the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the House of Representatives of the United States rejected the rescue plan in favour of the government's financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by the President of the United States George W. Bush and the political men at the head of the two parties, the program that was to rule the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the participants had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called on Members to vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent by 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could have had.
It was not long before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, it fell again.
Experts are now designing new serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and the House of Deputies and Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In the case of reservations for the following months, according to one study, the number of cases increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite low economic prospects, the thirst for German travel remains unsatisfying according to this study.
With regard to the winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent over the same period in the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Research Institute's survey, increasing number of reservations already dominates the autumn months.
Thus, the sales volume would have increased to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the DRV.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which analyzes monthly reservations data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, the DRV said.
There, the increase in reservations would be about one Third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our opposite would be destinations specifically sought by the Germans.
The specially organized trips are very requested, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individual organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking reductions or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been so much retained that an increase in sales figures will be re-registered compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
Ballermann or Pres-Ski hits, beer in litres and celebrities in Tyrolean costumes to design.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't actually have much in common.
She is a blonde, television animator and wears a fine-sized Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is an opportunity.
But one thing binds us: only three minutes at the beer party, and the photographers are already throwing themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that's my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The good-market Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of the beer festival and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on the Thérèse place, it's half worse.
Everyone or almost wears a Tyrolean costume or leather pants; no one has the air bloated or afflicted with shame - it is completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolean costume collects a few weird eye drops at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman made me note that I would have misattached my table: "on the left means free, in the middle of the virgin, in the right-married, in the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my back loop to the left.
"That's better," she told me and said.
Others don't get so bad for these technical flirting subtles and wear simple pets, on which it is written "Too drink to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked background without being invited there.
The young man in the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, who comes from England and comes for the first time at the beer festival.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an "oooo" extended.
He tells me all this after he's relieved of the cup he's been drinking before.
Right next to this fire mouth that everyone thinks is a garbage.
Bob is therefore one of those "wild bobs" sadly famous.
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers run to the place of the party and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses, rather, intervene in bribery - always by four, draw their shield covered with tent tents.
This works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we return full.
Those who sit in the circle of the boars under the tree are not visible.
"They're the ones who can't do anything anymore," she calls me one of the rescuers in answer to my question and then disappears in the mill.
Police-identified accident victim
A 63-year-old pedestrian died at the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in a Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
As long as Turkey did not intend to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter their countries behind them.
On the east side of the Bosphore, 20 steps can be, from Asia, one of the finest remains of his imperial ambitions.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is available at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each of its corners, like certain German provincial mayors.
The stones are salt.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the promised ticket, we no longer have any doubts about the size of the company, which represents a move to the west.
The race was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the land known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The isolation of its region in the vicinity, caused by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the Empire's forces further advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies outside Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an explosive ammunition train destroyed its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it's a sabotage.
Since then, she has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meads of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
Isolation of its region in the vicinity, created by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a Turkish capital coach, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour trip, driven on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, is an example of change in Turkish consensus.
He suspects the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stones and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built commercial centers and many pastries in which middle managers in custom-kravate-men and women meet for morning business.
Suat Kinikioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other party in Europe.
Custom, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The purpose of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now in its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly" he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That was not the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"but, at some point, "I asked whether Turkey should not choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to choose between the two."
He then stressed one aspect that almost all those with whom I had spoken have wholeheartedly told me: the Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore an advantage for Europe and the United States and for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe that travels metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be found in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting for the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was called "the disease of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased on September 11th) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Having already taken part in his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic heart of young people, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include at least 21 years of age, but before Proteus could not sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years of age refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the heart to manage any kind of music that was presented to him, whether it was Madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young heart was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant throughout the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in music.
So sing!"
His luggage technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if it was never dictatorial or apparent.
Whatever the music standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver was to be appointed knight, it's good Vernon Handley.
I knew him well from 1962 to 1982 when he was driving Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me-- and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the drivers who, according to him, "focused only on some people."
There'll be a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (decided on 25 September) states that "in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, a MA and a PhD".
That's what came from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, and at the same time he finished a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; he was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to dissipate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and Life " because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew me to the attention of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second blow for the super sales of Honda
In November Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitat, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
In addition, a few refined mechanisms are added, which increase the comfort of driving and make it possible to save more fuel.
A change in the face of a revolution.
So it's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it is important to stress that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation market.
First, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Exactly in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more than one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, it was thinking of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish branch are looking forward to selling 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz, which will allow Honda to make a large part of the sales drop in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, that is to say 4,000 cars unless in 2007, that is a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain by reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2 % in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this part of the market when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Niponne company hopes to commercialize nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of Insight will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled during the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters extra), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters extra) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change by 1.52 meters.
The dimensions also increase the interior space.
This is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the box capacity - which has a double base system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of additional capacity compared to the first generation box.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L box is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an 80-degree opening angle, along with the back doors of the first Jazz which would open with a 67-degree angle.
Engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two fuel propellers of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases the engine regime.
The first engine 1.2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tre/min and 114 Nm of couple at 4,900 tre/min.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propeller, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaching 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'beautiful car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, especially by bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that avoids accidents by imitating the stealing of bees.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre made this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Research of Sciences and Advanced Technologies at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of the Marks Management, the BR23C represents the output of the Nissan security locker.
This robot will allow vehicles in the brand to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that looks much like Nissan's safety locker.
But the most important are the eyes of the bee, which can be seen in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
He detects the obstacles that lie within a distance of two meters and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"At a time when he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by twisting its 90-degree wheels or more to avoid collision.
The greatest difference compared to any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and major engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upward or downward, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
" Each second this device must only process information and act according to these data.
There is no need to preserve the information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can operate continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we don't talk about giga-octets of memory, or even megaoctets."
This represents the first since the development of new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into the series cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last more than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They're afraid to be mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquidity to make plans, is not without genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's the hotel of bad credit... or stories.
The glamour of this accommodation and especially the Master of Hotel leads us to think about several times if it is the right time to borrow.
And, above all, where to do it.
Of course, this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game reserved for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to his table tour of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will spend nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new reception by a strong decline in its course in Exchange.
A week after the opening of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a unit cost of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is less than 19% than the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and with a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28 per cent above its current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 at 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the banking holding status," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but make it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis compels Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: on Monday, Morgan had just announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares in Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained to Tokyo that our pensions would be fully made up of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and in the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover our risks."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its securities Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in half a year its preferential securities into ordinary shares if the latter exchange more than 50% over the conversion price, or about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
One spokesperson of the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has stated that he has "clearly" relieved his budget since the end of August.
In the last few weeks, the group was tested, which saw its course in Borse half as the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt ran away.
This cost was reflected on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcys of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuela by Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" at the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the suffrage was zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it was necessary to obtain half of the more than one suffrage.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and an account of a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes", between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa also claimed on Sunday night on Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed in a tremendous way", he had assured the Ecuadorians, congratulating the governorate of Guayaquil, at 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in calm under the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), contained a text of 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution confers the power of the State on the economy, by reserveing it the "planning of development" of a country that is essentially living from oil extraction by foreign companies and currencies that send its immigrants.
The project, elected in 2006, also gives enhanced powers to the head of the State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Korea has already announced that it would use this power and challenge a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched a blow against the raisins of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanying prisoners were taken captive for ten days in the desert this Monday, healthy and except in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at 330 hours on board a special aircraft at the military base of al-Maza, at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi Hospital, a residential banley of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the predators," said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on tarmac.
Captured on September 19 at a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from hiding to another by 35 unknown predators.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer reported that 30 special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"A trade in fire blows occurred, and half of the predators were killed, the others were getting away," said the responsible who demanded the anonymity.
He noted that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to the Sudan in total, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men's secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on a patrol where the predators were on board, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United States Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which had immediately been deposed.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and this electoral campaign is under way.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the poverty of small museums, archives, archaeological sites or national historical sites that are growing hunger?
What politician would remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spend three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only castle in Chinnon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that heritage protection is part of the American culture and that it must be protected by all citizens, elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, the Federation of Historic Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 companies of history, heritage, archives and genomics are concerned about searching for history, preserving with three under the monks of private archives and preserving archaeological sites.
These are, often, the dogs who guard our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemetery.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states come to the aid of the Belgian-Holland Bank, as the first European banking institution in the event of a snowstorm following the impact of the credit market crisis in the United States, partially nationalising it. The three countries support, with a sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the competition officer of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis which has been widening for more than a year is for the Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will purchase nearly half (up to 49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank is undoubtedly going to sell part of its shares, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertigo fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to bankruptcy.
No matter what Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, the shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the leaders of society, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of the Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US saving plan of 700 billion dollars, of being the source of the fall in Fortis actions.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank, as the new director-general.
The financial agency also sought private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
In the past, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be concerned, and that they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's clientele circle and no agency was arrested.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A kidney in the faucet
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information about their purchases of medicines.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information on prescription drugs, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be between independent hands, otherwise it will be handed over to a reindeer" - recalled Richard Dicket, the program's creator for managing prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the capital insured in case of damage, of the health status of the client present, and if they consider that the risk is too high, they do not even assure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they signed no insurance contract with them until they became aware of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it is easily supplied to the pharmaceuticals, the data on the purchase of medications for the past 18 months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person is suffering from and what his health condition is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reduction, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, resulting in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk factor, so there is no greater thing to do to the insurer than paperasse. However, minor problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program are the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat buffs, but can also be effective against depression.
This is considered by insurers to be aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have developed their research and data analysis, and they must request the patient's authorization before collecting the required information from the pharmacy.
In the meantime, they are forced by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
Since recently, some companies have also dealt with the results of laboratory analyses, and relate them to the data on drug use. In this way, they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the expansion of the control circle of the authorities regarding companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has developed further ahead of his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the individual's exclusive agreement.
It is another question to know whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her agreement, since if he or she refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with her.
Thus and finally, chickens depend on the well-being of the kidney.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are multiplying their trades by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit next to other issues, largely global.
Today, there will also be a summit in France-India where cooperation on atomic energy will be particularly important.
The European Union acknowledged that India is a major emerging democratic power to whom a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet succeeded in agreeing on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They were not too late on this issue, yesterday, at this 9th summit organized in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Diplomatic Chief Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply trades by two, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have lawfully harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights. In this way, air exchanges can also take place in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation on the one hand, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only in the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgent need for a United Nations conference on this issue was raised.
The completion of the Doha business cycle has also been requested, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains loyal to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce its toxic emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that a global market should be put in place at the climate conference scheduled for next year, and that greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The head of state of India is now in the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of €20 billion for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would be over 15 years old.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Large presence of Italian publishers in the International Chamber of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The International Chamber of the Book of Frankfurt is waiting for this edition, more than 7 miles from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square meters of the Hall with more than 403 million titles in display, and Turkey as an invitation to honour.
This will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the Italian Papillon's inauguration ceremony: in fact, Italy will be presented institutionally, with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the press meeting in the Room Struktur, in Pappillon 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books is gradually decreasing compared to total Italian production, and in particular with that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fossett's aircraft crew, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada Desert, was found.
The debris was found on a 3,000-metre platform in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Within the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, avoided the doubts that remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one that Steve Fossett was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead .
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of investigators sent to the sites a few hours after the match was detected: it was very close to Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset decolla from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, the money and a pull.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history through a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, it became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he made the world's tour by plane and without a ladder.
Of all these records, the one that had stolen at 15,445 meters of height, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 outside the commune of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the off-road "compacts" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content, the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on 17 October.
Thus, the advertising battle that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented communication mode, through a 3D futuristic display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A Maxi exhibition project, organized in three different phases, will dominate the heart of the Milan shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that by looking at the picture, the car's out of the picture.
Then, through the use of the Remove8 innovative technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, to then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes tries to reintroduce something in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy has been ashamed of now? They are part of the Ultras Italy group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and has never, so far, created major problems.
He's never been in trouble with the enemy typhoos.
The group's extraction is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verone, Padoue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (unrealisedly) of Campania and Puilles were added.
They had tricolored flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed to avoid being identified.
They're inspired by the English typhosia.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifoserie of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian typhoos, 144 tickets for the party: all nominees, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had control over them all: among those who went to Sofia, no one had a Daspo running, no one was allowed to attend a stage.
Four Italian typhoos who had a history of stage crime did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, the typhoos arrested or identified in the riots may deliver a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo bans the attendance of Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot at the stage.
Congratulations.
But now is the time of fear-imulation: it is that others are at risk of adding to the hundred and fifty first.
"We must fire this fire immediately, and not legitimize who acts like this" supports the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open, especially in view of the match of the national Wednesday team in Lecce"
In the Poules there is indeed a small cloud of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday, the Casms that can even count on a section of Asia, that is to say secret services, which deal exactly with stage problems.
"The Duce-Duce hearts, and the arm stretched during Mameli's Hymne? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here's Domenico Mazzilli's opinion (expressed in a very unpleasant way) from the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a prefect in Trieste where he lived a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - add No.1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see well what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the hymnna of Mameli: they're not criminals either, but if you let me, they're not cops..."
