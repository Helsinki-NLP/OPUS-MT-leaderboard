UN chief declares there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts for almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again asked all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the Council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the side of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban regretted that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional forces "have made this situation unresolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to prove solidarity and unity shown when they managed to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 survey figures showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label it as a flip-flop politician.
Others called him a joke.
And others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to give Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed that Donald Trump is driving a percentage of two digits, and some voices are starting to wonder what this means for the chances of naming the real estate.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for nominating the Republicans.
Pointits shows that, during the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made Herman Cain a place in the polls, but none of them won in any state during the nomination.
And the reasons why it would be hard to fight general elections are numerous.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservation group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
We also present a few recent surveys that suggest that the real estate is not just something passing:
The figures that indicate support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republicans in the region have a favourable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicans said they would be "enthusiast" or "thank you" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 said it would be "surrounded" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% declare it would be "enthusiasmed" to 40% who declares the same thing about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be "unthankful" or "survey" if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticised for his insults and bombastic style, 52% of the Republican voters at the national level consider the real estate movement to be the right temperature to be president, according to the ABC News/Washington Post survey conducted months ago.
We see the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of the Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to a survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that he does not have the necessary personality to act efficiently and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temper has nothing to do with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republican electors are used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, four out of 10 said Trump had the most chance of winning the GOP nomination.
The situation changed before the end of July, when four out of 10 would have been on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters did not read very well the future.
In the same period of the last election, four of the 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry in the nomination process, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP electors consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if Republicans or return to another candidate, Trump is still in front of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while Trump's support will split to more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted at the beginning of September of the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a cooperation between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the 19-point businessman in a hypothetical confrontation between one and the other.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that over half of the voters who support Trump declare that they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, there's a lot that can happen in this sense and nobody can say that they'll never change.
46% say it leaves the door open to change its option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is now neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely as voters who declare they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" at the opening of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was the central subject of the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will harm rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey conducted months, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the problem of immigration remains in the light of reflectors, it will also remain Doland Trump.
Frustration towards authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, largely because of their foreign status.
According to the ABC/Post survey conducted months, six out of 10 Republicans claim that they prefer a political outsider to someone experienced in government.
People are also angry with Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans in Congress, 54% being "unthankful" and 21% being "enraged".
Jeremy Corbyn starts at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has long been expected
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later begin at Prime Minister's Questions, meeting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he has right to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analyzed almost by the mass media and the Labour MPs.
During his weekly appearances, he asked for "less theatre and more facts".
He also stated that he could give up some participations and give them to his colleagues.
The discussion will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he called a "phantom cabinet" and after the speech he gave on Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
In the meantime, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to keep silence on the birth of the national anthem in a job held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted critics from conservative parliamentarians and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesperson for Mr. Corbyn said that he "had kept silence in a respectful manner" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Forces in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight issue that he would be recommended to the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "indifferent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's front team, arguing by differences of opinion related to the economy, defence and external, while less than six in the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant states that the political differences in the Labourist Party are "accumulated" after Mr. Corbyn's appointment regarding his position towards the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring about changes that will eliminate the idea of limitation completely.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth labyrinth leader facing David Cameron at the court in the last decade, since he took over the lead of the Conservative Party.
The laborist leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "outsourced" for questions addressed to Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentlor Islington North said that PMQs involves a very high level of confrontation and that it will refrain from replicating and attacks, engaging in the exchange of serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the Finance Minister, will take the place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this matter.
In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political "Punch and Judy" style often associated with PMQs, but he acknowledged a few years later that he did not succeed in his way.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the rationale of a leader, the way in which he leads the House of Deputies and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although the critics claim to have become a cartoon and that he needs a thorough reform.
"Cadr in Joburg": Teens without shelter benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a trade and win their lives.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young people without shelter to take pictures of the areas in which they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage extensions
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, states that an increase in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the workforce within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a side-victim in the "furtuna" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior is more worthy of praise and not critical, in the opinion of President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks", was unsatisfyingly drawn in the light of the reflections by the scandalous crowd that Kyrgyz had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a racing match of qualifications played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair arbitrator had to intervene twice to divide Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put him on the ground on Kyrgyos, and I should have put him on the ground on this kid."
Although he was last seen doing a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is now in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for the place two to the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into conflict," Healy said.
The truth is he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused the crash in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket from frustration to himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, he's been very well mastered in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a 19-year-old very mature, works hard and has joined the team, has had no conflict with other players, is highly respected in dress, is trained hard, is in an excellent form, is a very balanced and mature youth and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyz into account for the important payoff game, which begins Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the original player from Canberra in the long term to the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus on the game completely and not think about the controversy around him [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick came up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matured under the public's eyes and made some terrible mistakes and deserved to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not in the center of attention to be able to reflect, a good thing for both the team and him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders has been reduced by half in national surveys
The former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the field.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic electors (down from 58%), while Sanders is in place two, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic electors.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidates.
In front of the CBS survey last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton maintains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among the democratic electors under the age of 50 has evaporated, now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in favour of the elderly electors.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with one percent of two figures, among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level declare that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if he were chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it only because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are excited about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of the democratic voters declare that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who declare the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the fact that the Vice-Presidents are considering a possible candidate for the presidency, 57% of the democratic electors would like to see him run - although a third I do not think he should run.
On the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders increases, from 20 points to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance of winning general elections; however, the figures have dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is located at a distance of two but the percentage according to which the most eligible has grown.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential run.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are well dealt with with some key features of their party's primary electors.
The majority of the electors consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trust and strong leadership.
Biden is seen best among all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrated and trusted, twice as much as those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Referring to all these aspects, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was a State Secretary, most democratic voters are grateful for his explanation on the subject and say that he did not affect their general opinion on the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of the Americans are not happy with her explanation now, while only about a third are grateful.
The public opinion was divided into March on this subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that that email-related controversy did not affect their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be complete and reliable, this continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it to be complete and reliable, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in the past.
62% of voters do not consider it to be complete and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be fully and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six evaluated candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are first classified in terms of integrity.
The number of people who view Sanders as integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the charged Brotherhood for the murder of a student in 1 year at the Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were accused of murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a ritual of initiation in September 2013 and delayed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to his eyes, placed behind him a 14-kg-full pocket full of sand and was repeatedly crushed while trying to get to a target, on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after losing his knowledge.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brother didn't call the emergency number after he passed out and pretend he'd been waiting an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police said.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the fraternity at the national level, to ask him for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal goods and put the good of the brotherhood in practice before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next day morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunks and thighs.
"Many families have been devastated by the friar rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's lawyer, in a statement.
Their brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of the Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with a three-degree murder.
The other thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with ultra-judgment and complicity to murder.
"We want to draw not only the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the phrase, whether official or informal, we will also draw it to the answer," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch's faculty banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood withdrew its membership with local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve will increase the interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (the growing market) will grow, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long.
In the economy, history offers little indication of time frame..
After the first increase in the interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, US central bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the time when the interest rate starts to increase but on the time-track needed to normalise.
Actually, there are multiple variables in the game.
In the end, however, market players could find that all the excitement associated with the increase in interest rates has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will be unavoidably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of "the cheap bans," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal levels, but it is still small to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how a few sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation in the market in recent months, the anticipation of growth in the interest rate can fly things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the gap in monetary policy again," analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed growth.
More precisely, over the past 35 years, the market has grown rapidly - with about 14 percent - towards growth in the rate of earnings, quite invariable in 250 days after (average 2.6%) after it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the Head of Nuveen Asset Management strategy.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares tends to become pronounced later in the growth cycle of the interest rate and the benefits begin to drop.
The recession is a reality of economic life, but the increase in the interest rate often contributes to it.
In the face of the situation, Fed faces conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will be close to its historical minimum point for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 growth in interest rates since 1950, nominal GDP was only twice as low as 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, little is expected to persist, the third quarter only reaching 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in earnings in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing themselves all year round for a growth decision by the Fed, all eyes being focused on meeting this week of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists are of the opinion that FOMC could approve an increase in earnings on the occasion of this meeting, transactions in the term indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study carried out after 1950, all the growth cycles of the interest rate so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, GDP eclipsed the peaks before the recession very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
On the other hand, this was a strange slow recovery after the most serious recession in the period considered.
The current cycle is far from the longest expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the type is somewhat similar to that of the dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of obligations, the benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first growth/down of the cycle occurs.
At the end of the growth cycle of the interest rate, the profitability of the bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these growths in the interest rate will determine the approach to profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, applying the curve.
High-efficiency obligations are better managed in such an environment, although "we are still concerned about the strengthening of profitability", said in a Kathy Jones analysis, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the estimated decline in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is more accurate, the spread of the average interest rate of credit has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed is concerned with politics.
In large lines, companies carrying out majority activity in the US will have to win as a result of the increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer as the increase in the dollar will result in their products being expensive in the global market and their debt will be cheaper.
"History shows that "quality stocks" tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial increase in the interest rate," said analyst Goldman Sachs in a customer report.
Companies with strong budgets exceeded those with a weak budget after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital gains and low volatility stocks also exceeded companies similar to a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also win the dollar increase.
Economists could also have won, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, said MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio post for "prostituting"
It claims that it is more and more similar to the commercial opponent
He also took the BBC Music Awards to the eye, claiming that British awards were being paid
Comrade Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this issue is not original
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming into" Classic FM, a prominent parliamentarian said, putting pressure on the post to prove that it does something that commercial posts do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public radio post "prostitutes" and resembles the commercial opponent.
"I feel that Radio 3 is "proselyt" - although I don't like using the word - but I feel that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seems to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that I do nothing but copy what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director General rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is very much in front of its commercial opponent regarding live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about the classical music I get from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rivals.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and allocate new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC editor Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he had to make more efforts to attract audiences over the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only thing under the BBC's seal criticised during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, mass media and sport because it would follow the consequences of its trade rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC-acquired talent show from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the sum of about 22 million pounds sterling.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George in jury - be performed "in a specific way BBC."
He added that he wished that the company “to find the gold-eating pig in its own garden” next time he launched a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future taking of new seasons in The Voice or spending the money going on licenses in other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the smallest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month the slowest growth from 2000 to now has been recorded.
Online sales took a long time three years ago, due to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts are of the opinion that the Black Friday in November could determine the resuscitation of expenditure.
For over a decade, online purchases have exploded and turned the commercial streets of Britain into ghost cities.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure in August has been the lowest growth from 2000 to now, with only 5% increase over the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the growth rate from previous years and return by 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took a long time ago, when buyers started using the mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it has increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it stagnates a little, you can notice a decrease (of growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
In the opinion of the experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that took place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers froze in front of computers to put their hands on offers, leading to the collapse of the sites of more detail.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers fought on chilipires, could determine the reticence of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least £ 1 in every £ 5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently being made through online stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes than to appeal to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the ban on the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed after the massacre of the Meccan macara
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on Muslim streets, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially defeated the giant in the construction of the Saudi Binladin Group for defeat.
Health Minister stated that a total of 394 people were injured as a result of the macara collapse
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macara smashed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who cried their dead came along on the way to express their condolences, until the first death came at the end of the final journey, at Al-Moaisse cemetery.
The sad memory kept by the holy place, where only a few days ago a construction mask broke through the mosque ceiling, falling on believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the build group of the Bin Laden family for disaster, which also had 394 wounded.
In the ceremony held on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macara smashed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when the macaraca broke down.
Mr Akram was in the Moschee Sea with his parents before the start of the annual pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the macara arm raised when the macara was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Swedish Press Agency, said the Binladin Group partially bears guilt for the collapse.
The English news agency's service did not present that detail, but said the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the breach of the macara in the court of Marie Mosche, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Haj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the macara and the Group's representatives have not been able to contact for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated security measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Ten of the surrounding macaras are the Great Mosque in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and has been conducting major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "refused" son, disarmed by family in the '90s.
The crash occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, with only a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, the essential journey at least once in the lives of every Muslim physically fit.
The authorities state that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that the relatives of the deceased receive a million Saudi Rials (174,000 pounds sterling) and the same amount to pay those with permanent injuries.
Other injuries will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of the conversion of credits into Swiss francs
On the bank market there have been already two bids for the conversion of credits into Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of the foreign exchange risk and the reduction of the rates.
The disadvantages can come over a few years, when the variable rate may lead to increased rates.
Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of converting credits to Volksbank francs, and Bankpost has announced a conversion offer for its customers.
According to the data collected by Finzoom's financial portal analysts, Bankpost offers a fixed fee of 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the transfer offer of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of customers with free credits due to the second successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk and administration commissions paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in law.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, the face of how much equivalent monthly payment is made in their prior conversion.
Thus, the Transylvania Bank reduces the rate by 42.5% and the Bank Post, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the credit cover in the CHF is to remove the foreign exchange risk, protecting the consumer from future franc credits, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which it is paid.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the re-evaluation of ownership is not done, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a reduction in the monthly rate, the face of which customers pay before conversion, equivalent in law.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is more than the amount of the charge, and the customer repays very little in the main.
The Bankpost offer with a very small discount in the first three years seems beneficial to customers.
But he doesn't know how this experiment will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk to all credit in lei with variable maturity is that ROBOR indexes will rise significantly over the years (more than Libor - CHF indexes).
For example, ROBOR three months ago is 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to meet other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions
The world looks forward to the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will take a crucial decision whether to increase or not the interest rate for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, less than half of which thought the decision would be taken last week, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that the interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we face a situation in which a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, raising trillions of dollars in the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the global situation less pink.
It warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
You see that they lost their charm.
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 lost her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It also appears that the actor would have been confronted with the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of these are definitely costing.
The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is at the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in the Manchester United game in the League of Champions, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and that will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes after Shaw, at the age of 20, broke the PSV defense.
She received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before she went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture on his feet and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe he'll be taken to Manchester.
It's horrifying - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has a hard time, then plays fantastic and now something like this happens.
His oxygen mask was put in the closet.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at the double fracture the rest is six months and won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red cartridge and the granting of a sentence.
Arbitrary Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's fake and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I am, start the way to recovery, I will become stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit Luke Shaw's crash in the face of the PSV
The foundation of the team of England has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said: "It's a very ugly accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never want an opponent to be killed.
Moreno broke his foot playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I managed to see only the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it, but I could not see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to get through this.
I feel stupid, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission, but it's still hard
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, however, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 battle in the test matches.
I wouldn't remove any variant of a winning in motion.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin in the beating line and collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by 2012 events and will have a positive youth attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left England team for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple reality but hard is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - the players are their own electors.
A few fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he does more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
The main coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised her attitude even when performance was not as strong as his ability and I'm not surprised; first of all, he's a teamman.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs--like Sam Robson before him--while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had good luck at home and moving.
The only disappointment you might have had was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in the highest form - but that missed occasion is the area of the past.
The team's got Alex Hales, a batsman I'm very good at.
He's a cricket player who's got the "X factor" and I noticed him early at Yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch Trent Bridge.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this of course depends on the membership of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open up at battle with Cook, which would lead an extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown that he's fucking given up.
Perhaps Moeen did not bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games test 38 as first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the back-up spinner position and, although I had a limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his fragile age - with an average of 31 at the beat and 35 at the ball - and they might think it's a point, but there's not a lot of sprinklers and the selections opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has also made several changes to the training team.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master's strike.
It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that it has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and unremitting ambition.
I always thought she was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, she has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices from the dresser, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes resting for one day's matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don't have a problem with this.
Although not all agree, trainers and selections do not do the program.
And you have to keep, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easily.
Brexit Tabara could have a cause if the economy remained in the acalmy until 2017
Every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to maintain Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly in the way, even without the choice of genius Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn led the Labour Party or the TUC to bring serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last day that - buried in a crisis similar to that of the EU - not all are caused internally - some Member States are fed on the UK agenda for concessions and changes to treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they would not want to do so if they were to exodus social protection.
We could even call Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor participate in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture of them in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare they have won alliances for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU roof - "Do not leave us alone with France," Berlin says, suggests that more ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, an extremely careful German Chancellor, is an ally who has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation turns out, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stayed too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be real or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist right government, Spain one on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energies would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - a thing that they do not even want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "British Britain has gained nothing from renegotiation".
Europeans know on their skin how attractive Fleet Street can be and how skeptical they are are oligar press barons that look at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry into report 2:1.
I may recall Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a co-sponsor in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of unpaid tax pockets, foreigners who cheated on telephone and pseudo non-homes who hold most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw her kind of the same way but realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in the opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back of the month at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a long time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC left a Sunday vacation.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call evolutionary.
It states that it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with the "English" conservatives might agree with that.
That's what Hilary said "Un Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and TV this week, when his researcher fought not to admit that the name of John McDonnell by Corbyn as minister "in the shadow" on financial problems was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his labyrinths, without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said and did not match what the JC told his colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting of the night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - keep it, he also made me aware - the discipline of the messages remains important in the television era and in particular in the social media age, a fire of paranoidness and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favour note in Europe, allowing him to take good support for the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophism on the quality of EU members - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among the left-wing dissidents for which small differences narcissism is a central dogma.
As with his sophimism about NATO - Tom Watson is reluctant that the JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspected voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of English people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I recalled at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the Public Health Department in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them related to tobacco industry.
Experts from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the publication Launched in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
The PE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence".
Several researchers, however, questioned the data robustness and showed the finger to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical journal attacked the "extraordinary fragile base" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in BMJ have put their claims and their foundation "on solid ground or on moving sand".
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said it is expected that the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, one meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criminal decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefed in a research work.
McKee and Capewell either claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from the British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT public health accreditation in a sustainability report, it stated.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarette producer but not the funding that there are reports that it would have been received from the tobacco and tobacco producer company Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which members of the panel were selected, but among them there are several "frequents" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work of financing the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for the expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the head of the PPE tobacco control section also participated.
The research work developed by the group "mushamaly emphatically" lacks " solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have in accordance with the majority of the criteria", said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the Health Department of the PPE, said he had responded to BMJ's claims in the past.
He said: "Electronic forces are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of the two people who have smoked all their lives loses their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health is less comparable, but we need to continue to study long-term effects.
The PSE has a clear duty to inform the public of information which is being returned and which is not recovered from evidence, taking into account in particular the high level of public confusion as regards the risks relative to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clearly the current evidence - that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not at risk, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfil our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Claims that bring shame to the British arms trade
Follow the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
The iron for tearing the glaciers!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause inflamed pain without leaving any trace!
The joyful voice and animated images do not doubt that this claim for the world's largest arms trade is an open chain made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell weapons of repression regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posts in bus stations and in subways that need a second look.
"An important announcement, travelling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line transforms itself into an image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealerships will lie on the DLR Customers are asked to contribute to the cessation of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are performed by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-litre Allen package that says "makes access to about a third of the advertising space in the world's bus stations."
The transport region of London is not amused by this "vandalism" as wheeled.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at Essex University, artists ask more and more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists turn to collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that happens to the shipowners who circle with the subway.
The film by Amnesty had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
The creation director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the advertising for the arms trade - with an empty space in ExCel's calendar - and thought, "To offer them the campaign that tries to avoid it."
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertisement, but "reriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more exciting".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the store," said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered at the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the subject of arms trade comes from within ExCeL, where exhibits offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab published an order received from the US army on "AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher."
This includes “a single-shaped focus that provides humming effects behind the armor within the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules to live in the house
It's been 11 years since I moved into my home, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in bartenders and moral relativity, but now I barely remember the strong smiles of those we angered - and the many complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Change in the home can lead to conditions ranging from nervous decline to horror.
It's tempting to tell people where you're from, if and where you've been a year's break from the study, how you feel about Corbyn and why "you're totally independent of Marmite because, in good boys, there's nothing but the HAHAHA Droid extract, you find me in my room."
Breathe deep.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show your interest.
This soul chat and help you differentiate the people you like from those you don't talk to even if the crowd came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Sleepers often enjoy parties with drinks, movie series and socialization meetings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their intimate lingerie.
Similar subjects: Don’t even think about starting student life in a relationship
Introverts are part of special treatment at the university.
Your sleeper should be a refugee, but in many homes there is a culture of stay through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization and friends who last all their lives.
All of this can be horrible for someone who's trying to charge his batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want to stay friends but I want you to go to recover my energy that I consumed by interacting with you."
Try to sit when a colleague is exhausted by socialization - and try to send an SMS instead of knocking at the door.
When it comes to knocking at the door, do it.
A guy who was staying in the same house with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen enough.
Make your friends cooking.
Since you're starting college in the Bake-Off February, if you knock on someone's door to get to know and go and a black lighthouse, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've prepared something for you, now smiles and I ask personal questions."
The good things prepared in the house are a great way to make you friends.
Your tenants will feel obliged to speak and may be able to associate your face with a pleasant surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a well-known cook.
The beans, sugar and fat will most likely determine the others to pretend that I sleep when you knock on the door.
The burden of food is a frequent crime in the student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in your tea is all stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if you're burning on the inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying and I understand you - try still to address the problem more mature than my homework colleague, who colored her milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
Now he's in jail.
Do not make noises that do not allow others to sleep or study.
That's not just because it feels good, it's because you're going on your own.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to give the music more slowly because it was 3 o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to make music stronger.
When they stopped the music at one end, at 5 a.m., the girl was nice and allowed her to sleep for two hours before giving her the maximum to the music, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/wife would move on the same floor?
On the contrary, would it not be extremely strange if you were confused by a college pal with your future husband, you had a couple, you split up, and you should meet each other every day and maybe even see him happen to all common friends?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy paliler colleague is certainly not your future husband, try at least to be rational.
At the moment you realize that someone left their keys in the untied room, the line between gossip and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful farce is fun, but it can damage in a few moments.
Prep a fun and valuable safety-related lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't put the items on someone's ceiling more than twice.
Violent David Grimal: In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and non-commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, by the right "ciudad", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a director, and that makes it at least a curiousness in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a performance, Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when in the first plan was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works made by Enescu were unmissed.
Both shows, shown on the scene of Athens, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 as at that time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there is no director.
The director is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the part of musicians, they need an education either to become soloists, or to become interpreters in an orchestra - speaking of instrumentalists, not composers.
They're trained as "specialized teachers."
They've got the impression that they need a director.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the music fetishing is heading toward the director.
And so, business, the music industry, it makes marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have on one side qualified workers, what is stupid, and a public who can't listen, but must look, what is stupid again," thought David Grimal.
The violinist said that this change in the way music makes came as a result of the "musical disappointments" of his soloist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money and music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because we no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So I've found no point in continuing this way.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one would do anything without a director: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How do you imagine you're marketing with a collective of musicians where there's no self?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the whole, the lack of a director has not proved to be a footing in the musical act: "I am curiously singing a more complex repertoire, as it seems simpler, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role," said Grimal, adding that at Sunday's show "I had 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "A special festival, where there are the largest orchestras in the world that sings 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Roman music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced the works of Enescu into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romance music, "for there is a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal is fighting for the change in the way classical music education is made, considering that "the mass of musicians, as it is organized today, has an origin of death" and that "the future of music represents insatiable music".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, opening the albums, they're all great, amazing, but as long as they're done in the music service.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it's no longer free.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave example to the Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
In order to enter the EU, health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat had to be adopted.
Production and agriculture are in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
Music happens the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances make roses may not be very beautiful, but then when we cut them are real roses.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If I consider - as do Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, I reintroduce its invasion into school, I reintroduce the concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell music subproduce," Grimal thinks.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, this everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's all different.
According to your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist Zambind.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of some other way of making music comes just from exceeding this status of "soldier", the overcoming of what "they think are their limits": "Musicians work at a certain time that they're not soldiers, and therefore after concert they're zambitors."
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.

Cinema City is looking for "Milie Voci Mari"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: doubleing two characters from the super-production "Creation 3D"
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Offer her the chance to get a star.
In September, during the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Milie Voci Mari", offering them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animation film.
If the classical drawings focus on the voice of the actor of the particular animated character in the last period, the story creation shall be taken into account and those who will interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that's why we start an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to register their children at our competition.
They'll have a special experience, because characters are nice and replicas are funny.
"The children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, during September 11th - September 30th, Cinema City organises a selection of 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a trial in a recording studio with professionals.
All you have to do to parents is access the small-vocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where to register the child at the competition and prepare it for the voice test.
Later, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the text that the child is going to read and then the child will register by interpreting his own version of the duplicate.
Four films about friendship, bass heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the sample: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: The Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala the famous 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double as many as a character from the super-production "The Snow Queen - The 3D Zappezia Creature", which will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, due to tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx has declared disappointing results for the last quarter, the giant in the field of supplies, reducing profit estimates for the year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its terrestrial transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by about 2.5% in pre-market transactions, 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of the following year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts suggested a $10.84 figure, according to a FactSet survey.
The estimated decrease is due to an increase in prices of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher overtaxes for land transport of large packages or heavy weights, which will apply in November.
The company said it is still expected to increase its profits over the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
The president and Director General Fred Smith said that "the company is facing a much weaker economic situation than expected, especially with regard to global production and trade."
The holiday plans were announced one day after the UPS competitor stated that he intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The action winnings were $2.42, under an average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount of $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of revenue recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping saved the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the incomes of the Ground Division increased by 29%, but operational revenues have practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic rates, while the revenues recorded by the Freight division decreased due to the increased costs.
At the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening call, the FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
Tuesday at low closing with 11% at year level and 17% at maximum record on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most expected meetings in recent years, the federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot meal of Mahon Honduran to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the Central Bank's sitting room, a wall painting of the United States will be lit.
The map is meant to remind Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, that his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above anything.
The Central Bank has received a double burden from Congress: maximising the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten burden: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be disbanded by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force from the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growth economy, the recent agitation of global financial markets could scare Fed officials already careful about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with a percentage point.
"Evidently, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to be followed," said Lindsey M. Piegza, head economist at the firm firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the growing uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to provide them with arguments to expect more," it said.
There is no consensus on the decision that Fed will take, which in itself causes instability on the financial market.
About half of recent economists in Bloomberg have anticipated an increase in earnings this week.
But financial markets expect Fed to slow down, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a downturn in the stock market if the Fed increased the interest rate, unless those who develop policies would slow down the strike by promising that it would go a long way to the next growth.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial media went 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16,599,85.
The advantage was triggered by expectations that the Fed decision factors will maintain the stable earnings rate this week, said John Lonski, economist chief at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for Fed to increase the interest rate at this time," said Lonski.
If the Fed decision-makers do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts have stated that an increase in the interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about the moment the Fed will act.
Only a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow down the monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that it was expected to increase this year's interest rate despite the concerns raised by liberals such as the need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wages have presented signs of growth.
And although inflation has continued to not reach the annual target of the central bank, the Fed decision factors have stated that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices found in a sudden decline.
The economy "may face higher rates and needs them, given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to go into fibrillation at the end of this month, after China has devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial media dropped by 16% below the record reached in May, as investors were afraid that Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has somehow declined this month, the Dow indices are now about 10% below the maximum in May.
For the Fed decision factors, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the rate of increase in interest rates.
"Without what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in the last weeks, it would be more firm in the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, he expects them to wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and almost no data to be based on further events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in making decisions.
In fact, however, Fed has become a global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
A simple allusion of the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "slow" its monetary expansion has triggered a global shock on markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it is expected that Fed officials not only monitor progress in other areas but also consult other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science," Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department of the Investnet Inc. Well-being Management Company, said.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has a reaction story oversized to changes in the financial market that seems to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacer, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body, which supported the increase in the interest rate, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia has led the Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "in spite of the implications of limited identification for US development", Laker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back on those losses.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the case of a major crisis, such as the market crisis in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a member of the Bank of England's profit-setting committee.
The last period of agitation is not rising at that level either, he said.
"Of course we don't want to get in the situation to fear an increase in the interest rate because the markets have upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this respect, I do not think that it should take early action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts by the Nine channel to broadcast to Today Show about changing the party's leadership
The urgent displacement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report on the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the Liberal Party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nina channel passed from the capital after Tony Abbott's attack on Malcolm Turnbull.
The competition issue, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was held in London as part of a series of broadcasts conducted over the course of several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascade Niagara and Cancun.
This distance cruise didn't seem to count too much for viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise having an audience of 397.000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today has seen a slight increase compared to the monthly hearings (317.000) and last March (283,000) but the figures were smaller than the figures last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August today had an average audience of 318,000 and the Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
Meanwhile, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, not only Parliament is affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The main news was the dazzling start of the 800 Words series by taking it as a protagonist on the former star in Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, subject to a recently widowed father, who decided to move with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the hearing last night responded with a response that "yes".
The X Show Factor transmitted by Seven was maintained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking easily the shows The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven recorded sushis and downhills on the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half of an hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half of the time (17:30 to 18:00) went to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613.000).
Last night, the first half hour of the show The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decline of the hearing recorded by Chase Australia on the second night will provide silent confidence to the Ninas that the Hot Seat will finally triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces the Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

4 people lost their lives after the police shot rubber bullets in the protests in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the majority that demonstrated against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, approximately 280 km west of the capital of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police section, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after firing fires before using rubber bullets.
According to that statement, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The shock was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that the new provinces established under the new constitution would divide their political influence.
Protests also existed in the west of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent strikes launched on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement for the country's division in the province - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a central government country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted on the terms of the draft constitution and officials said that the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wireguards, dogs, cops and weapons
The Prime Minister continues to exchange replicas with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Wednesday government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stand against the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania is not in agreement and will not apply anti-democracy measures, watchdogs, wireguards or gunmen.
"It's a shame for Europe 21 to apply methods from the 1930s," said Victor Ponta.
"The Prime Minister also said that all data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and settled at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad front of low pressure at approximately 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde is a 60% probability of turning into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre said Tuesday.
Another well-defined front of low pressure approximately half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of forming a tropical cyclone over the next two days, added the meteorologist in Miami.
Weight reduction surgery may be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery in mild obstetric patients with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether mildly obsessive diabetics live longer after the surgical intervention of weight loss than those following non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralise mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obstetrician in obstetrics, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, named and bariatric surgery, use different methods to minimize stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed on subjects with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (MIC) 35 or above.
The BMI, a weight unit relative to the height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and those with more than 30 BMI are considered obese.
You can calculate the IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used narrow data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in mansions - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in mildly obsessive people.
The mean BMI in subjects who had surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained close to the same level in people who received non-surgical treatments against diabetes, namely 29.
Among those who have had surgery, diabetes has been completely cured 36% and partially 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes mellitus was completely cured at only 1% and partially at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL “bad” cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored the blood levels of the haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of glucose in time.
Researchers say that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is less than 7%.
Following surgical intervention, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated with medical methods, approximately 8% were maintained.
However, this improved glycemic control - reflected by improved levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomy group in manchon, the surgery bypass intervention group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI values (7.4 versus 5.1) and in haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, the Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who suffered bariatric surgery presented a probability of approximately 29% less dying after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who have undergone surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 procedural interests.
"This is the point where this work is critical, because it states that this surgical intervention is safe in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, it states.
Blackstone added that their patients and doctors should start taking the weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we ask people to take this matter seriously," she said.
I believe that once these genetic changes have been accumulated that have reduced their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader issued an appeal to end the violence in the refugee's mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of every nation and even of every continent.
He also stressed that although remarkable, the country's response to the refugee crisis in Western Europe is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is a great concern for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we must think about long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education, to Muslim countries," he stressed.
In the end, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attacks on 11 September, claiming that the violent response from the US generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences to a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used the force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Increased four times the number of children who have had hands dirty in the last 4 years
According to the anti-toxin centre in Georgia, the U.S. anti-toxin centres reported an increase of about 400% from 2010 on the number of children under 12 who swallowed depleted hands with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, the director of the Anti-Infectious Center in Georgia, cases of ingestion of handwashing in children under 12 years of age reported at the anti-infectious centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children drink deliberately and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube can be followed by movies that present teenagers as drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
Teenagers seem to have mixed the detergent with alcohol to get a bigger drink.
Young children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurting her," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (handwashing) are perfumed.
Hand detergents with aroma of mushrooms, grapes, oranges are the most attractive for children.
The hand cleaner contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Center for Anti-Hungary in Kansas University Hospital, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand cleaners in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays with hand cleaners with scented caps, arrived in the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol179, twice as much as the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor in the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaija was fighting and couldn't go when he got to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital to identify the signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers to use wet products or services without alcohol and not leave the detergent at the request of the children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing detergents containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three New York fourth grade students schemed to poison their "bad" teacher by putting antibacterial products in class, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him in his class room.
The police considered the plan to be "unsignificant" and addressed the school inspector's disciplinary problem.
Rumour Mill: No misunderstandings at Celtic
Griffiths removes rumors about Celtic's misunderstandings, Dela admitting that Hoops is not at the best time, but they will come back.
Hearts facing the SFA regarding the charges of Neilson and Warburton are concerned about the acquisitions in January that affected the team's unit
Dons grow the difference to Celtic at five points
The punishment of ADAM Rooney in the first replay brought the Aberdeen to a narrow victory in front of the Hamiltons at Pittodrie, Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths removes rumors about misunderstandings
There have been rumors about misunderstandings in Celtic, disassembled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to face the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
The absence of stockpiles in the title is boring in the Dutch - by Boer
The former middle class of Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic - because they did not fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now ambassador of the Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands no longer transmits the summary of the Celtic games; why?"
Because there's no Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of Rangers.
It's about Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams and there's interest.
The tension is great in games in Old Firm and not only Scottishs want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, Deala promises.
RONNY Deala accepted that Celtic is fighting out of the way, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The encounter with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the encounter with Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the top of the five-point ranking.
But Delilah said: "Celtic had periods before and will return."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to go further.
We definitely need the support of the Celtics because so the players are getting better.
It's extremely important to stay united now.
Warburton's Prudence on January Transfers
Despite the comments just a few weeks ago that suggested that some targets would be identified for January transfers, the leader of Rangers, Mark Warburton is worried when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox team's unit.
Brentford's former chief said: "The January transfer period is very different from the summer."
In the case of players transferred summer, there is a period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you do worse if you bring players that aren't necessary.
Celtic is targeting Michu after retirement
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw to the expiry of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player fought the ice cream problems for two years and failed to leave the country of Wales in summer.
Hearts facing SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Patterson was eliminated and lost with 3-2, but the red cartridge of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red cartridge cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynacastle
The Invincible Hibee was taken over after admitting that he sang a song with offensive verses about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a Derby with Edinburgh at Tynacastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," the striker said, adding: "I don't need to say that I'm not going back to Tynacastle unless I play for Celtic."
The Tanzanian Council trusts the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that those in the Dundee United Council still believe that the management team will change the situation - but it is agreed that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys in shape again," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy for the "pure victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must be desperate for Hamilton Accies to win the seventh consecutive victory in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the sentence of Adam Rooney's first coup.
McInnes said: "There is no team to win anything, in the cup or league, and not to win games like that."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while Britain grows
THE WATER's rate in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in the period May, while the number of British unemployed has increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9% higher than in the United Kingdom, according to the figures presented by the National Statistical Office (UNS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over the three months, with the current employment rate of 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the average of 73.5 in the United Kingdom.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The plan of the authorities in the long term has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a member of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate of the labour force recording growth and the unemployment rate.
Why I am a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today's day, except for a late legal intervention, I'll see how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a room for observers from the Oklahoma State Prison and I'll see how Richard Glossip is being executed by the administration of the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day draws closer with the story, it scares me.
So why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually the requests exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lotterium to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The electors will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd stay close to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I developed my own connection to him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a flesh and a pix to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants it, he gets access.
I complained about her.
He acknowledged that "it could have been better," but he still felt that I was wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list any time.
But he wants to be present with an international report to write about the subject.
He thinks that if he dies, advertising will help move against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the media file series I did.
I'm not coming back here for all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll see him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man who likes to die useless.
Peter Moody claims that the guards tried to spy on him and threaten to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said that he was racing Victoria or trying to infiltrate a spy at his grasses last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the guards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were conducting a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass was the removal of Lady Daddy from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody said to Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what was best for the course and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed up his words about spy statements and did not want to be "a wolf that doesn't reach grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about it and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all comes up all of a sudden," Moody said.
It's known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I'm working with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's better.
Since they're starting to think it's not like that, I have to give up on the coach job.
At that point, I'm gonna have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb into a given interview for racing.com in which he said the Department of Integrity tried to spy on his grades.
"After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart stayed in a room next to a man - whose name I'll tell him if I'm asked - and offered to hire him to my grades to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course he thinks I'm sad.
If so, then you should give up all because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at that time and I know today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can pull people out of the coaches for what happens in industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and give it to me on one side and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now could lead them to think about this variant.
But I've come to the point where I don't care anymore, and that's what's bothering me.
I'm very excited.
I'll put pressure on them and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The hairdressing of the coach increased once with the extensive study on cobalt testing involving Lidari and the elimination led him to say that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unveiled Black Caviar champion, labelled the rule of treatment on the day of the race as being "ridicola" after applying on the feet of horses a cataplasm with nemole or clay, which violates the rules.
Break the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees made a mistake on his foot.
It could have happened last night.
Could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could have been disqualified for three months for treatment on the day of the course, consisting of the use of cataplasm, for which the stewars opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by a flight from the site of the accident.
The biker was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit on Saturday morning by a car on Murray Valley highway.
Police representatives declare that the car driver did not stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of fleeing from the site of the accident, not offering first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, answers the opponents in the wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, referred to the criticisms of his team’s gambling tactics as “denatured subjects” brought into discussion by the main two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said Arbitrators allowed Storm players to "get to the edge" the team in Storm's nervously won game at the end of the game played Friday night at Sydney.
The coach at Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after the victory of his team in the championship match with North Queensland Cowboys, played last Saturday night, when he called the match a "refuse" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland don't really understand wrestling.
Bellamy jumped into defense of his team's betting tactics and said the players simply focused on "contact" when they did.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticised his team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain of wrestling when they beat us with 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I haven't changed anything every year in our defense systems or techniques, so much so that in the last six weeks, I've really put the focus on contact in parking and so I've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
We know how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "souling football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the 2010 championship playing "placticing".
Wayne's talking about kicking football.
And he argued by comparing the game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and talked about how palpitant the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care about any black under his fingernails.
But now he's got a team that can play what I think is being a football player, especially because of young rapists.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two mediums like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somehow concerned about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a sharper competition related to score compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The match at Broncos was probably a good match, I haven't seen him yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there have been two trials, that's what it means to be a battalion game?
Or do you mean take a break and don't walk?
For me, there are plans.
If I'm talking about us, it means at some point we could meet him.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys, or the Cronulla Sharks, at the end of the preamble next Saturday, at AAMI Park, the tickets are putting on sale from the next March in the morning.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to accompany the pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping then authenticated into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of inconsistencies with children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while she was sleeping.
She looked on the phone and found disturbing messages after she immediately alerted her mother.
Upon arrival, the police saw the five photos then analyzed the computers found at that address and found "anxious" searches on the Internet using terms to find inconsistencies with children's subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw the pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretends he's a cop to scare them".
Prosecutor Elidid Robertson stated to the Dundee Court: “He said it is an addiction - that it is dependent on scare people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to become a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent his pictures and the fact that he asked that person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to get along.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see his images with rapes and murders.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother and her trembling and crying.
The girl saw the inconvenient images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, at the age of 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, filed charges that he had made or photographed children in an inconsistencies, and violated the conditions of release conditioned on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
The defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it can be said that this crime "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael delayed the sentence until October, for reasons of social reporting.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before the settings for other files.
He was transferred to the sex offenders' registry before the sentence was passed.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, gave the wrong speech to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a stage.
However, filming the fall has become viral on socialization networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by the opposition's representatives who said that they would have received anonymous threats of death, threatening them that they would not somehow reject Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they hated him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The leader of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is called "death," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns parliamentarians that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The leader of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "anxious" about the threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilitys
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 available as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the services sector.
This year. HP will be divided into two companies on the stock exchange, separating the computer and printer division from the corporate hardware operations and services that are in the forefront of growth.
The proposed availability will cost approximately 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will hold a large business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to a new business-related style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company's statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the object of the activity the production of electrical equipment and the garage in Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley league.
HP went through a massive reorganisation to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest US technology companies, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in a direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching peaks in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campaignn Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Men, wanting to put the cultural question that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the centre of the struggle for this challenge.
A recent study conducted in more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy condition", his chances of recovery are doubled.
In the same way, for those who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends reduces half the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, in order for friendship to take effect, it must be accessible first.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priorities before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to entertainment and success, even if isolation is really the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extreme values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which also affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it drew attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the place of work but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The death of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments he looks at football in the comfortable photos and Ross's passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can associate with this situation, even though they often tend to explore their feelings completely.
As one social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people with a tendency to commit suicide and depression has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."
Often, people who call on us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old saying to manage yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to my mind when I try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The series highlighted little moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective intervention, externally, through the phone, people who have arrived at times of despair, long-term support comes from their family and close friends.
So, if you are attending this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full editing of filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marches and helps PSG put Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his first match in the Champions League and helped the PSG to push ahead of the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present you the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain, starting a series of matches from the League of Champions groups, with a peaceful victory 2-0 against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of her first match in the League of Champions in the PSG team, bringing France's champions to the advantage, although they missed a number of occasions before ensuring their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in minute 61.
Coming to the Group A along with Real Madrid and Şahtior Donetzk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the best but also to improve the journey to the final quarter in each of the last three tournaments.
However, even though they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect table, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who wasted the opportunity of being replaced by a team from his hometown and the club that started his bright career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so victory with 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference with the next class, even if there are other aspects we need to perfect them along the season," Blanc says.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we couldn't give one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 discount obtained from Bordeaux's house in League 1 in the weekend, but Di Maria took over the light of the reflectors in four minutes.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive centre was named the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he landed at Marco Verrati's pass behind Malmo's defense before shooting incredibly across Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone like the PSG expected to win a little victory from their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national teams, with a defense of five people and two defensive mediums, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by shooting Nikola Djurdjic who passed by Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
Instead, the PSG players slowed down several times, giving a few unnecessary steps and not finalising the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed at least five trials only in the first replay and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game was resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved himself much more understanding in support of his colleagues, being the one that Di Maria sent in a miscarriage of Wiland over the gate in minutes 52.
The second goal was recorded in one final after an hour of match, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who recorded the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centre.
This goal eliminated the hope of Malmo's people that they would rebalance Wiland's score and only a great stop from the distance to reject David Luiz kept the final score before the new entry of Ezequiel Lavezi cancels a gap in the extension.
Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that the PSG had been with a class over and that "the last match I played in the League of Champions was in December last year."
Since then, I've only played in a league in Sweden, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Down the hat for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore strands $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by a drop in stock prices on the stock exchange, made $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted at the London Stock Exchange, said he sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds to buy the debt.
After he lost 57% of his market value this year, the company went to a standstill at the prices of the stock exchange, as China's economic downturn influenced the demand and brought disaster on the market.
The preferential right of subscription increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares amounted to 2.77% to 131.60 etlingi at FTSE 100, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore has revealed the sale of $2.5 billion shares as part of larger plans to cover nearly a third of the debt of $30 billion.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 etlingi per share, with 2.4% less compared to the closing price of March.
He pulled 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the increase in the Chinese economy in the prolonged stagnation led to a substantial increase in the prices of iron mines, with approximately half, and coal, copper and other goods decreased by 20-40%.
Xi insists on the wider expansion of the world economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reformed group that the economy needs to open up to the outside world to feed on growth.
"China must commit to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," said Xi, during the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Further General Reform (Central Leadering Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
The promotion of opening up and encouraging reforms will bring new imbolism and vitality and will bring about economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, the relaxation of customs control policies, the encouragement of state enterprises to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested step by step and improved by test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will provide the market with a more important role in allocation of resources, ensuring a regulatory business environment and providing a wider market opening.
The authorities of the State will also weaken control over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to manage their business.
According to the statement, China will also allow the border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.

Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday, after the ship in which they were shipwrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, reported AFP according to Yahoo News.
The boat is located in the Aegean Sea and is directed to the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's Coast Guard has transmitted that it has managed to save 249 people who were in the shipwrecked ship, but it still does not know their nationality.
Last month, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also during the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned along the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the ship transports more people than its capacity, so it shipwrecked.
The route has recently become a popular one for immigrants who want to escape the war and heavy lives of countries such as Syria or Iraq.

If he wants us to formalize by deciding on the Congress, we'll do it too.
There won't be any emotion about that.

That's when I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a picker, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, it wasn't my job.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
He didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I continued my work, everything turned out very well and probably changed his ideas as well.
But I wanted to go.
If he didn't want to stay, then I proposed a contract marriage.

Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't consume alcohol, he was visible to be in a state of drunkenness.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without being drunk, I thought she was crazy.
"Insa friends and family thought 'maybe he drinks alone, he's an alcoholic in secret'," she said, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's films with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't recognize himself: "I looked in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although doubted for a while, eventually went with him to numerous doctors, remembered that Nick smelled alcohol.
The moment that put Nick's bums the hardest was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he discovered he had a three-fold alcoholism over his legal limb, although with one night before he only drank a beer.
After years and countless investigations, Nick discovered that he was suffering from an extremely rare disease, auto-brewery syndrome.
Practically, the body or makes all the carbohydrates consumed fermented, turning into alcohol.
The one who paid like this could be Nick's disease was actually his wife.
The disease doesn't have a cure yet, but since he gave up the carbohydrates, Nick's had no such episodes.

The government approved, on Wednesday, "National Immigration Strategy 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "a further step in Romania's efforts to modernise the immigration management process in the national territory", according to a press release.
The source shows that the strategy aims to manage effectively the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies set at European level adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the countries of Romania's immediate vicinity, measures were taken to manage the unitary and coherent situations identified by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants in Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"The Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay particular attention to citizens from countries with potential migrationist status or who may affect national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivation of the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out and sets out some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, the more rigorous control of the legality of the headquarters of third-country nationals in Romania and the proper application of distance and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.

Among these are: facilitating access to third-country nationals in Romania who respond to employment needs, promoting access to third-country nationals by higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficits.
Referring to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it is "a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system to stop the migrationist phenomenon found in growth".

TVR driver activity report, rejected in commissions: Stelian Tanase risked dismissal
Parliament's cultural commissions rejected the report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society on Wednesday 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 Members voted against the rejection (sensor Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next full meeting will be discussed.
"I believe that taking this situation into consideration will be made relatively quickly," said Senate Culture Commission President Georgica Severin.
He added that it was "good feeling" that the TVR leadership should also be present at this meeting, provided that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the Committee on Culture.
It was good to be present for the TVR leadership because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members again tonight, with about an hour that we didn't know any more hours, but today, after the headquarters of the assembled offices, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting her.
I think at the time you're summoned, you're being paid a budget, paid out of public fees, and you're summoned to a board meeting even if you don't like living.
"Because it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution under the authority of Parliament," Severin said after the Committees meeting on Parliament's culture.
He added that in the sitting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
The debts we've seen as they continued, came with the idea that this year would have been a day, but they haven't been paid from history.
"I remind you that not because of my fault or any other of these commissions has lost that deal with the banks and the fissure, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that once the activity report is rejected by the whole meeting, elections will follow for a new Board of Directors and it will elect the Director General of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
They're not gonna do it.
It is important to make political decisions so that this institution works.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will stay at the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, full of Parliament, will, by their vote, choose with great enthusiasm the people who will run the TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for the girl of institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities you should have - I feel good about the wage girl because she's a little cheater who comes from employees, claims, dismissals.
"When you get in such cases 50, 60, 70, something can be done and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the President of the Senate's Committee on Culture concluded.
Even though he did not present himself to Parliament, TVR president General Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament take into account a number of measures that could lead to the saving and securing of economic and political independence of public television, including the numbering and indexing of the TV tax.
In writing, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexing of the TV tax, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of technological changes per day, as well as the regulation of the control procedure in the area of the TV tax and the detection of infringements and the application of sanctions and penalties.
It also prefers to issue a provision to prevent the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv's agents for the collection of the TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission of the home.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television and for a 15% contribution to the CNC at the level of 3%, but also for the amendment of Law 41/1994, in order to be able to receive the budget/funding allocation for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sports events - World Football Championship, Golden Cerbula, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will be unable to pay for the following months, given that labour law requires the employer to enforce the judicial rulings, even if they are not final, and wage rights are given priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce spending on staff and production of TV.
"This reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed," the president's letter to TVR appeared.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by its own efforts alone.
"Without the support of the state institutions - the Government, Parliament, the Presidency - Roman television will be found sooner or later in the impossible to carry out its public mission," the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.

The generators of Vasile Blaga, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, were sent to the court on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Parquet on the side of the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
It is accused of tax evasion, in a file of approximately EUR 600,000, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was previously arrested on 22 May.
It established the watch firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother, in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation reiterated that, for the purpose of deducting taxes and taxes from the state budget, the representative of a company specialised in security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, by which fictitious transactions would have been demonstrated.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have registered fictitious purchases of services, which in fact were not provided, the state budget being so damaged by around 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The cheques set Sanmartean's fate
Six of the Al-Ittihad club have set the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announced that Sanmartean's division of Ittihad is imminent, the sponsor Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very grateful for Sanmartean.
Lucian plays match title and does it well.
They realized that he was the best and that he would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been a variant to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, such as the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been realized," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice-president at the Court of Auditors
Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, cousin of Prime Minister Victor Ponti, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded "for" and 108 "for".
The vote was secret, with the ballots.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reported.
Otherwise, the liberals criticised Sarbu's name in this function and announced that they would challenge the CCR, under the condition that he has a DNA file, but did not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days to resign from the Senate, according to the law, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice-Chairman of the Court of Auditors, released after Ioan Anton was revoked, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found him to be unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the hottest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper was going to play the role of a cook in the Burnt movie, the actor made a devaluer that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, she said she grew up in the kitchen: "I worked a lot of my life as a cook."
It has devalued that he worked in the kitchen for 15 years, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so the whole copy was made with Italian grandmother, related ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had during that period, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two".
"It's no reason for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you'd love if I told you," she said, but saying what she wanted from her copyist was fulfilled.
Until the age of 40, the actor acknowledged that he was in the near future the director, taking Clint Eastwood's model, which has been the king of this entire era.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned the statements of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Wednesday morning according to Hungary's political decisions are "nothing better than those of Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, by his irrational claims, was making a noise all over Hungary," Hungarian Foreign Minister sent in a communiqué.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrollable slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he lost his full support in Romania's internal policy," added the chief of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a post Tuesday night on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to attract attention and sanction the behaviour of official Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not want to respond to the challenges that have come from a representative Hungarian government.
"This is a disgrace for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta said on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that it is the adoption of a rational and sustainable solution to the refugee crisis, considering that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sarma gimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, politicians are decisions with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all European values - what we see in Hungary in the last few days is totally contradictory to these goals and values," stressed the chief of the Roman executive.
Earlier Tuesday, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta about the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, considering that those statements were inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The chief of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extreme and false remarks" of the Roman Prime Minister hold the internal political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest expected excuses from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've said and said is that I'm always against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the grenades, that all who come are terrorists, are the fools of the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people as some people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors, with the battle and the insemination.
"I don't agree with that," said the chief of the Roman executive at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government of Budapest has decided to start preparations in the field for extending the border with Romania of the fence built on the border with Serbia to face any changes in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to raise a border guard solves nothing about the refugee problem and "scote Hungary in Europe".
What is the link between Osama bin Laden and the cracking of the maca
The Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partial responsible" for the collapse of a macara, Friday, on the Sea Mosque of Mecca, an accident following the carnage 107 people died.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company did not "respect the security rules", reported the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), reports the BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The signature will also be excluded from the new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father after 80 years and is now led by the former terrorist leader's brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of Mari Mosche, to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night, during a storm, when a macara, probably disbalanced by strong wave reefs, collapsed on the eastern side of the Marie Mosche roof in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut the contestants' mouth
Considered by many of the world's largest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labelled, after retreating from activity, as a weak coach, which cannot be able to perform perform and in the new position.
After the unfortunate experience at the national team, Staraua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, after a year, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team that sponsors it.
After a year of team takeover, the King demonstrated that it is capable of transforming a team that was struggling to save from retrograde in a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future registered, with Hagi coach, 16 winners, 11 remates and 11 infringements.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, which fights European couples.
Things took a tournament and better for the future in this season, the team's intruded reached the place two in League 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than Stara.
On the other hand, even if it brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period, names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea appeared.
The club's policy has made a team of followers from the future for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
In addition to Steaua, the future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Commercial Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played as a small country so far.
It is a legitimate strategy, but after that you cannot ask to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
The big dates come with solutions for the EU as a whole, says Cristian Gynea, a member of the board of directors of the European Centre for Political Affairs.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Gynea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and even politicians will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as best we can and adapt to us.
In Christian Guinea's opinion, we find ourselves in an extremely emotional moment, where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
Once it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up their free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now an animal created at another time and has not been adapted to the situation at this time."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that has actually solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC presidents in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to strengthen a vote in the Council.
All the predictions said they would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the JAI applies the principle of unanimity and any state may block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves a 55% vote among the states, namely 16, which represents 65% of the EU's population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because this is a sensitive issue, there have been reactions to rejections even in Germany against the policy of opening Chancellor Merkel and they did not want in many countries to appear to be a reaction of the type 'EU sends migrants to our heads'.
They did so, but the problem remains because, obviously, this currency creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably attend major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to slow down?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the Schengen external border members to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has limited the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up on the Dublin principle, according to the way migrants are responsible for the state in which they enter the first hour, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece capoteases, you can't say at all that it's Greece's business.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to make the effort to receive it?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if it gets to them.
To remain a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European states will be caught taking up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely to reach unique filtering centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
He's working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have ten years of experience trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophob current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in the Precise camp and who have just begun to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have taken to leave, the winter is hard past the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to a wave perhaps even bigger.
What are we doing with these people?
My prognosis is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look at it that way from a media point of view.
Talk about countries with smaller or larger experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to the radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other migration values, but this does not mean that they are not integrated at all.
It has remained an integral part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the UK.
But the means of the police are not going to work.
To create strong Europe and illusion.
It must be based on integration mechanisms in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We have to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, to stop walking in Europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family, including by convenient couples.
The immediate problem of these people's long-term integration problems must be separated.
If others have been involved in long-term integration, it does not mean that we should look at them as they do in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean that the country will be rebuilt overnight and you can take it back.
Until we have solutions, we see strong in Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls are raised, controls are reintroduced at the border in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and setting the rules so that the pressure was too high on the days when they first set foot for these migrants.
I mean, we're free to go out there, but everyone's in trouble.
In the face of such a wave, it can't be so, because some countries don't make the girl.
When such emotions exist, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run, there's no big deal going on.
After the attacks in France, we don't have much more draconic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that's installed in both ways.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions on her basis.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of Belgian statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being men.
And then, you have a dramatic case of the baby infuriated in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement which is not only for people but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up on this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules and something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in a different era that was not adapted to the situation from now on.
How did Romania play so far in this crisis?
Like a little country, which thinks if she pulls the bag in her eyes and she's sucking her ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the realities of migrants' waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
We have done this, it is a legitimate strategy, but you cannot then be asked to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
You're not, you're not playing big country.
The great tariffs come with solutions for the EU as a whole, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Roma for Schengen will fall very much.
President Johannis says it might be good that I haven't already entered.
So we're going from desperate entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
There is of course a risk that Romania and Bulgaria will enter Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean it's a reason we don't go into Schengen anymore, but let's be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be the only rules for accepting migrants, the only rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, the only rules for the countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a link between the second focus, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means invading Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, probably the Assad regime would have been long gone.
And it was good to dive before the main or opposition to be the Islamic State.
A couple of years have been a struggle between Assad and the secular and moderate Muslim armies, supported by the Gulf and the West.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but it can't participate in the solution.
It creates a focus of instability and chaos that cannot close them.
But you're only great power if you have solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to earn time.
Putin's probably waiting to make offers, press him on the buttons to solve the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in some way or other matter created by him all.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are being manipulated by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the socialization network are preparing the other opposite, the "Dislike" button.
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg pointed out that the "Dislike" button will show a better sign of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone puts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it's not very comfortable for people to give "like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like those posts," said the Facebook representative.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There is already a lot of hate on Facebook and on socialization networks," said Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the New York Times Facebook page, where an article was posted on this subject.
"I want to give 'Disklik' the 'Disklik' button," he specified.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, said there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, it supports, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary only accepted 70 migrants on Tuesday, one hand of thousands of revenue at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary has declared state of urgency during the day in two judges along the border with Serbia due to the refugee flow, instituting a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a guard at its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
Measure delayed or sudden reaction on the part of Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they'd seal the granite for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to cook asylum.
"As you can see, this is completely different," said Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Before imposing the new immigration legislation, a 5,809 migrant record went into Hungary on Sunday, the police announced on Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also patrolled Hungary in Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "New" seat of the Jewish Council is drinking.
Two builders, in insolvency
The massive investments that have been made here in recent years, with a view to changing the institution, are to be attributed to the fact that they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The Jewish Council headquarters in Vasile Alessandri Street will be able to give up on its own.
Within one and a half years of the completion of the consolidation and refurbishment of the building, the works did not reach even a half.
A final stage in the epoch of the building was consumed last day, when the National Dispute Resolution Council (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take up the contract to carry out the technical project for the further work to be done.
The initial project was completed by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the termination of the works, the negotiation procedures were launched without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the firm intended to update the technical project and then organise a new tender for works.
"The negotiations did not end, however, through a contract, with the CJ appreciating that the proposed form would be disadvantageed by the institution," said Rázvan Timofciuc, representing public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to terminate direct negotiations was appealed against by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance sent a complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as a delay.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack CNSC's decision at the Court of Appeal, just after a final sentence of that decision, which can be taken into account when another designer is found.
Thus, building consolidation work could be resumed earlier in the coming year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the refurbishment of the technical project should not last long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We expect to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The work on strengthening the former Police Office began in 2011.
A first contract of work was concluded in April 2012 after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The tender was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company entered into insolvency, and this contract was concluded after payment of 1.5 million lei.
The work has been carried out so far in proportion to about 50%.
Initially, the work on consolidation, refurbishment and management of the building was assessed at 7.7 million lei.
"Stop, I say it all!" - a statement that could incriminate the former head of the House
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file from the Office of the Court signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the others accused, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant from the Office of the Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) accused of DNA in a file of corruption has acknowledged his face-to-face.
The Agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascalu was registered yesterday at the Iaşi Court, and the judges decided to give a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dimitru Daniel Dascălu was accused of being a continuous false intellectual and agreed to run two years in prison with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to Dascalu's actions, the prosecutors stated that he, as a member of the Cadastral Office, together with other colleagues, "has entered into several verbal acceptance processes, with respect to the award of service contracts in the prior key by O.C.P.I. I. Iahi with the directors of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Cad de Data and Topography SRL and PFA Lipşa Štefan, which falsely certified that the services contracted had been carried out in full, under the conditions under which they were not performed and were not submitted to O.C.P.I.I.Iaș".
Last day, former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current members of the OCPI were sent to court in this file, the charges being the decommissioning of services to the companies mentioned, although the works were not carried out.
Before the trial, it's over 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of the president of FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national women handball for qualifying at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Roman Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, in a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions groups.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games, but for this it has to go through two stages of caudine theft, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Thomas Ryde.
Staff to be composed of seven or eight persons.
He wants second coach, doctor, two mastors, carrier coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They've asked us to qualify for some things, more precisely material for physical preparation, which we've never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympic Games. And I'll do whatever it takes to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's lots, lots of money.
But this is the way to make performance.
Because at the moment we're in the time of the rock preparation.
"The teams with which we are fighting have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who mentioned that he is trying to obtain the necessary amounts for the purchase of these products from MTS and COSR.
The president of FRH also referred to Romania's infrastructure and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is embarrassing to be put under the mark of a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let us not forget that in other parts of the world the entire Olympic neighborhood has been built over a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the present Olympic area of Barcelona, there was a pile of garbage, and now there is a beautiful repertoire.
It also happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success and in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, bringing major handball competitions to Romania is a priority.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people gave their agreement in principle, but they soon realized that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that I agree and invite them to the first match in the new room in Bucharest and then we discuss concretely.
"So we have all the opening, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," official FRH explained.
The former great handballist avoided evaluating the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach Final Four: "I have asked all trainers to be reserved in forecasts, that if they don't comply with their return."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbis begins on September 23rd, against France
The captain of the national rugby team Mihai Macovei said, on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all parts of the Romanian lot are ready for World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the motors at maximum speed.
We've been trained to give the best score in the four matches.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are hard and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see.
But, of course, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, is the announcement of so many years of work.
I wish I hadn't disappointed anyone in the family of the rugby and come with nice results at home.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family such as the rugby in Romania, are proud of the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's national team selector Lynn Howells, who is at first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby's selection: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me, it is very important for every match to make Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Federation of Rugby, Haralambie Dimitraș, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last years in Rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made by the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I believe that we will be at the bottom of the event.
"These boys started to play in Romanian teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who decided to make a dream," Dimitraş said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, with the following matches: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at the Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England - Fiji match in Group A.

14 million lei give to St. Spiriton Hospital in Iaşi at budget correction
What will be bought with this important amount of money?
The "St. Spiriton" hospital received from the Ministry of Health, following budgetary correction, about 14 million lei.
The money received by the medical unit to be used by the end of the year will be invested in the modernisation and repair of clinics, but also in medical equipment and techniques for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomographic computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six trusses used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped with adequate, ophthalmogenic microscope and other devices necessary for the performance of the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the hospital's received money will be directed to the construction and repair work of the "Marelius Ars".
Out of the budget correction money, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernisation work in the main throne.
"In addition, the following days we will receive the works from the gateway that connects UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure transport under decent conditions of the UPU patient in neighbouring clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in court and the Dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which it will organize in the ambulance, in the same way that it is currently operating.
The clinic will function in the area where it is allergology, hematology and endocrinology of the ambulance and will have approximately 30 beds.

The presence of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaşi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my life experience, neither I nor my wife will ever want to walk in your city again.
Without wishing, the misinformation from the canvas, the rejection of the RAPT controllers, and the bonus of an amendment "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iaşi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist supplies.
They also received an envelope where the RATP routes had passed.
"Sweet" with these maps, husbands visited the Iaş.
But two days ago, you were in Copou, they wanted to get to the Mall Palace.
Because it was not toned with tickets at the station next to the Copou Park, they were based on the information printed on the canvas: they can take the ticket via SMS.
Nobody told them this service doesn't exist anymore.
Trustees in the canvas, they went on a bus and tried to send text messages after the instructions on the canvas.
Unfortunately for them, it made its appearance a team of RATP controllers.
They said there's no 2-year-old service and that it was announced in the press that it's cancelled.
EU WHERE TO KNOW what was written in the local press, I come with an evening before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's not their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one amendment instead of two (my wife and I).
"I paid, I didn't want to spend my day visiting stand at January and give the statements there," says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of misinformation on the canvas and the controllers who "applyed the law on blood".
It's not right, and I made a session at the RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerated by much, but the idea is that I felt bad.
Ghinion for Violators in Vaslu.
They had an accident and remained in preventive arrest.
The process of the seven Violators from Vaslui moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal.
The court-martials tried the first term of trial in an unpublic sitting where the seven young people accused of beating an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Prior to the commencement of the trial, one of the judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for detention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge activated until summer at the Vaslui Court, where he was president of the Section on the ground, he was the one who, on 9 April, admitted a complaint made by four of the accused, having their arrest at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete of which are part of the Magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file, Judge Dan An ton made a statement, because his daughter is in a relationship of co-incineration with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Violators from Vaslui remain in preventive arrest.
Those blacks will remain in prison for at least 30 more days, when Jews who will reduce the possibility of their release.
Following the deadline of trial, the Court of Appeal will be held on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iaşi, the doubt with which the Violators were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident produced in the neighborhood of Păcurari, the car entering Iaşi in the center.
The Iveco self-service with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks wagon bus that came out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The duba runs through the end of Easter.
The car entered Iaşi here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iaşi to Graduri, then on the bus.
They've shorted the road a few kilometers.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called for another transport to take over.
In a short time, at the site of the accident, a car was sent from the Penitentiary of Maximum Security Iaşi, who took the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other tube, the guards surrounded the back of the niels, and the arrests came out in a hurry, two or two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the car are friendly about the damage to be paid," said Chief Mädălin Čăranu, in the IPJ.
Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what it will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the outset, clearly and clearly: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalise are, in itself, a small number, but enormous compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, is far beyond our good solidarity intentions with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Of course, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm convinced they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasite of interlopes and paralysed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves powerless in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsum is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of all colors were not able to absorb European funds, make roads, gardens or modern schools, provide decent medical care, narrow the street poverty, create decent paid jobs or keep their own young generation home.
Why would refugees be established in another country where they're fleeing?
But what makes a lot of wonder is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
We are first struck by the Belican ferocity of the powerful EU states, which gives the utmost evidence of generosity when it comes to sharing the troubles with the smaller countries.
Then comes the fearsome hypocrisy of the Romans who, although they have millions of reds scattered around the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
He's probably afraid he won't steal any of his national beings.
Finally, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only calling the war's horrors as a reason for their departure, do not accept the exodus destination other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
In addition, the simple way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken away.
The causes must be eliminated, supported by some and, strictly on the political correctness card, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romans from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has proved to be an anchored, decombined and overstated building.
I deplore the fact that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but that the EU does not have a future plan.
And improvisation and threats don't help anything.
Then, what more benefit does the EU have if the only advantage the Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be brought to debate because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At a certain point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the crisis of migrants, though.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource exhaustion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially Africa, to a better life.
As such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what it will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, in practice, imposed
The tendering procedure shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of detention, the Club of the Museum of Roman Literature is offered by the Jewish Council for 10 years to be awarded.
The construction has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two rough levels.
CJ accepts as the destination of the building only those of the literary cafe, library or other cultural activities.
The building was assessed at EUR 68,300, the start value of the auction of EUR 6,830 per year, with a bid of EUR 25.
The concessionaire will have to operate continuously and permanently the building and cover the entire cost of rehabilitating the property, in accordance with the technical project to be completed.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period during which the public power unit was operating and after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance work has been carried out as is currently required during the operation of a building," the documentation on the tendering procedure states.
The club's concession offers are expected until September 18th.
Two brothers from Tomešti swallowed their sleep.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-old children, that 11-year-old from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed more Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother followed a treatment, and the medications were not hidden.
The children were taken by emergency to St. Mary's Hospital in Iaşi.
They're stable, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
20 years old has received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in the dark of the '90s, when he had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a family established in Italy, in the same years when adoption was a regulated wave, a young girl, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met each other in Iasi with biological parents from a village of the Jews, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will complete these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughter a humid and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iaşi, to know her dark past.
"The newspaper of Iaşi", which attended the efforts to search the family of origins after a few extremely vague indications, was witness to these meetings that practically broke your heart.
The reporting of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are moving and compulsive.
Crine's story began 20 years ago in Ruginoasa's outgoing locality, when he was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
Home there were misunderstandings between parents, and Mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls painfully Alina, the biological mother of the girl.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still the girl's father, Costa Rica Balkan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Judge Teleorman.
Their lives were to be definitively divided.
They didn't find Crina at the hospital anymore.
After boarding, Crine's father went to work elsewhere, and returned six months later.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iaşi, and the father, when he came back, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She would have thought she was abandoned," she tells a cousin of the family.
Because of the financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child all the time, it was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and the Protection of the Child Iasi, who then gave it to the care of the Plasamment Centre in Bucium.
They were years in which abandonment and adoption were further regulated against today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadorian and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love instead of the Crina blonde, and after some time it was supposed to move definitively with them in Italy.
The small has already been in place for almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities have lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," says smile Salvadore, the adoptive father, as he grasps the girl's palm.
In the country, the parents of Crine, Alina and Costa Rica, continued separate searches, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but he didn't get any answer where his child might be.
The police then told him it's possible to be dead, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I was looking for her here, they told me to the court that she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her were gone.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about her all the years that have passed, but there's no way we can walk, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of the organic mother of Crine.
But even though years have passed, parents in Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvador and her wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past was a link to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina confesses joyfully.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counsellor Iaşi, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, which explained Salvador's desire to find the biological family of Crina.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first moves.
We only got a name, the Costa Rican Balkans, then the locality, Ruginosa.
In a short time I had an activity with the primacy there, and I could ask if there was a locality name given.
Then they gave me a few clues, just that the person found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father," explains chief Romanca Ichim.
In total, better than three months they took the authorities to find Costa Rica and Alina, especially that everyone had their own home in another locality.
We began our journeys somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Romance Ichim added.
In the weekend that passed, Alina and Costa saw for the first time the girl lost on the hospital halls in Iaşi, 20 years ago.
Father, excited, could hardly have mastered his tears, and his hands were trembling.
He's barely changing a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't sleep much anymore.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," a niece tells us, and she comes with Costica de la Ruginosa.
Meeting of the Crina with the biological mother and brother
In his discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-listed university in Italy, Costa Rica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wanted to return to him, in the village, he would come quietly: he could give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and to build a house.
Mom is also excited, crying, and hard to believe that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I've been hoping, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," she tells us with great tears on the cheeks of Alina, the mother of Crine, while holding a service in her hand.
He's still hiding his tears, happily, because in a short time he'll see her face after so much bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will complete just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she has a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two moms and two dads.
But my parents are finally the ones who raised me.
It'll be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family meeting in Iaşi
In the Union Square, under the sky of early autumn, the family of Ruginosa reunites its destiny with their daughter of Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old now, finishing high school, according to the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costa, her biological parents.
I don't divide borders or countries anymore, but only one barrier: the language.
Which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iaş, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say it's the first event of this sort done, and that in the future, if there's another chance, they'll do it again.
It's the first event of this sort of organized, such an emotional charge, and I'm happy to be a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, drug-dependent people.
But we're trying to save societies something good back.
"If I am still asked for such an event, I will do it very kindly," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counsellor Iași.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, withdraws the storytelling.
I understand: there's a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with guns at the foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody shoots their soul
The boards of the PSD's exit branch have closed a gun armistice at foot.
After successive rounds of discussions, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being and the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend the hostilities.
The executive presidents of the party, Liviu Dragnea, are asked to present a united position, and the outgoing Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Apart from being finished, the party's internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow fighters to shoot their souls.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He released a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution not to put the party in danger.
We have a party election on October 3rd.
All functions will be made available to those who wish them.
"By then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica.
The two days of weekend discussions just led to the conclusion that nothing was set.
In October's elections, there is an acute competition for the office of President of the Jewish branch of the PSD.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main function of the party's exit branch is the State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, Jewish Councillor Vasile Câtea and interim President of the Jewish Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also be added to the mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the Jewish councillors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer register, sources from the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations over the last few days is the former branch leader, Prime Minister Gheorghe Nivita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on the day of the elections, candidates may be filed, and they would not look at anyone if it happened.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Jewish Office and all new governance structures," Câtea specified.
Until internal elections are organised, the management of the Jewish PSD branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nivita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until 29 September, preparing the elections to be provided by the executive secretary of the branch, Jewish councillor Mihail Popescu, located in relations with the Nivita camp.
Phone contact, Cristian Stanciu has appreciated the discussions over the last few days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
There has been a partial consensus in support of a unitary team to deal with the case.
"There are, on the other hand, several variants on the intentions of the PSD presidency, Iaşi, the list remaining open," said Stanciu.
A outgoing judge rejected the case of Violators in Vaslu on grounds of concubinaj
The seven young people in Vaslui's trial convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal Iaşi.
The Vasluans sentenced to five years and eight months and eight months and four months will present their arguments on their release, after the founding court, Vaslui, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for detention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton appealed that one of the accused's lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the judge at Vaslui's Court of Justice who sentenced the seven young people to the sentence.
The judge therefore talks about the challenging reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public.
"The Court finds that after the imposition of a preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not a private one, under the influence of the accused, their families and their local supporters, a strong feeling of indignation at the level of the local and national community as to the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure" appears in the reasoning of the Vaslui Judge.
Magistrates have also removed the main defense of the seven accused who in the process have invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be the "door of the church".
"The Court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is lacking in relevance, an aspect which the accused wanted to highlight by the defences they formulated, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," it is further stated on the ground.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past ten years cannot continue the same in the next few years.
Until Saturday, probably a little world in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he has become the new leader of the Labourist Party in the UK, many wonder how we can be affected by the choice of a politician who, in turn, is not in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of the labyrinths after the war.
Marxist declared, anti-Monarchist (at a time given to Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to expel the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a fellow of Vladimir Putin (anotherly regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today") and the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to abandon nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred by the United States.
After the model of all populist demos, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things about the kind of people he said and promised Tsipras in Greece until he gave his heart to the real world and economic laws.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader includes, among other things, massive renationalisation and money printing as a solution to the financing of development projects and the coverage of very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to the printing of money is not unanimously adopted on the world, we then had a global prosperity! but who else to prevent such details.
Of course, we can charge blood to the bankers, become a kind of left-handed enemy, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand's and Holland's mandates.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without covering, made by populist demagogies.
As Margaret Thatcher drew attention, "the problem of socialism is that at a given time the money of others ends."
Few people give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever get to the prime minister.
At the beginning of the 1980s, another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in conviction as the party's leader's fresh failure to vote.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the trade unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the labour force as a whole, and extensive automations have made the industry need for a highly qualified workforce, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
However, even in opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its last number, the Financial Times considers that Corbyn's election increases Brexit's chances, that is, the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The new Labour Leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has led to the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with the rhetoric of anti-immigration, and look at the crisis of EU-based refugees reaching an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
However, if the British decide following the referendum, which is to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic capital loss for the whole European project and the deep shortcomings created within this Euro crisis and now the refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leave the scene for the most worrying.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterpoint to the Franco-German axis (in which however Berlin becomes increasingly the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers of the country's remaining in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I have just recently had a sample in Jean Claude Junker's speech, is increasingly tending to make major decisions over the heads of the large majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens when electoral support for anti-system formations, anti-immigration that are at the same time and Eurosceptic increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loads has reached higher rates than ever in the past.
Where and the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that goes from national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will attend a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will drive most of the countries in the region and the peripheral interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed on the popular rhetoric of the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the next few years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both of which are caused by decisions that have not been taken into account but by the integrationist political ambitions, not by the ability and availability of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect Romania's greater situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are capable of dealing with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brancusi, god country.
Rockefeller, "How can I help you?"
Brancushi: "Take and measure the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be somebody, to be famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his reputation, however, something almost forgotten is hidden today, when millions of successful stories have been delivered, reserved for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "everything."
What about Constantine Brancusi?
What's it really about?
His picture appeared on the banknote.
And recently, a famous bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising moment.
Whites produce and deliver money in almost 60 years since it's no longer between us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
Otherwise, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes out with the grown-up, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to the Brancushi."
The country is filled with its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children, to the elderly.
Brancuşi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Not even the communists managed to extract it from Romania's memory and culture.
His stories start today the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of figures and shares.
And then again, what would it be to say, to write about this man?
Looking at the multitude of books and articles that are trying to rebuild his destiny, Brancuşi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, it's those people who tell you that if you didn't have the luck of being born in a big city and in a family as well as you've got, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancusi's life is the perfect example.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Maybe from here we should start the text that follows.
With a sense, however hateful they are.
Look at the success stories of assholes, which are delivered daily to you in newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at this man's figure.
Do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, of him heard an entire map world?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be somebody.
That's what he did.
Constantine Brancuşi was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobita, a small village in the municipality of Peșșani, the county of Goj, at the Carpathian banks.
He's the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although he came from a family of settled countrymen, Brancusi led a modest life, but one of them had to collect his spare parts that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering the childhood and the places he grew up, the artist had to witness, in a meeting with Petre Tútzia, from Paris, in 1933: "By then life was beautiful and harmonious."
For thousands of years, people have been leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything passed quietly from one time to another.
And you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
Brancusi's childhood was, however, far from an ideal.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the natural place.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the goat was "the case", following those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going on properly, Brancusi caught a moment of general negligence.
It fills its palm basket with corn and drinks on unsweetened.
He's falling asleep almost instantly.
The first people barely notice in a few minutes.
Mom panicked, then in tears, believing her son was dead.
By night, when the father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by praise, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those waiting for him with his soul at his mouth.
The party is immediately turned into a cave.
Dad's already thinking about burying.
However, someone thinks it's good to call Baba Bránduşa, dofftooiai and a servant of the Brâduşa.
The fire checks the child's breathing, then puts it under the nose of the horse, gathered almost.
The strong-strengthened child.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep beyond his drink, with joy, the party with constant praise and more strength.
The next day, the father and son meet through the meadow.
Radu Brancusi puts Constantin to collect some nuts and bring them.
The father lays his child with his head down and, with the clouds brought to the boy, beats him to keep his mind.
And while he feels the shock of the hits, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that things around him can appear distorted.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he was to recognize old age, if the star himself does not participate in his disorder.
May the sun be as troubled as his father as what happened to him?
At the current time, the city does not work
A parliamentary appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for them.
The independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on the PSD and PNL to stop the internal battles and reorient the agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great disunity and so on.
I haven't seen anything from the USL projects since 2012 to continue.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, you see just how politicians have to deal with their possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's leave the politics a little further, gather and talk.
At the current time, the city does not work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you no longer have time for those who chose you," Blajut said.
He appreciated that the current political class derailed the outgoing electorate, the consequence of being a very small presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will continue to focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservations to new political initiatives, such as the "Pentru Iaşi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chances and will only break from the right electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civilian active people, who are usually right.
"It's getting even more straight, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," Blajut said.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidate for future local elections, discontinuing the rumors about his intention to enlist in the race for the primacy.
I've said I don't want to run for any local function.
I wonder if you'll continue as a member in the future.
I tried to appeal to unity for Iaşi and in the talks on the halls, with other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make an image of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," Blajutt said, who appreciated that the main reason why the voter is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the people.
A colleague from Tatarasi said they don't get their money and have to go on the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's not a little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to raise the money from the casino.
At the end of the term, I will make a report on all that I have spent, except for the salaries and maintenance of employees from the office.
I got up in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and other accounts.
"Let's say a parliamentman doesn't get his money is pure hypocrisy," Blajut concluded.
