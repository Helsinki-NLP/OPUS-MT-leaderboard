European inflation dropped in food
The accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the staggering increase in the price of food products.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering, after 2.6 per cent of October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent, the Union Statistics Office in Luxembourg announced.
Official forecasts were only likely to give a 3 percent -- Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike US, British and Canadian issuers, did not cut the basic interest, its assumption that the decrease, together with the price increases in raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would result in a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is found in trap 22: "to negotiate" on inflation so that later it does not have to intervene on this issue.
The inflation rate of 3.3 per cent, recorded in Germany, struck the record of twelve years, while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was fired in the euro area as a result of the galloping food and energy prices.
Quotas at the end of the wheat increased by 88 per cent and soybeans have reached their maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased by 52 per cent this year, reaching the black gold nearly $100 barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, instead of 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months about 3 per cent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, for the beginning of December the support of the Youth Democrats Alliance increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - about 13 per cent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of party voters - due to the strongest strength of opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 per cent) compared to the support of one-fifth for the Socialists (20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats Alliance would not reach the necessary threshold for a parliamentary census: their support within the entire population is two per cent.
Among the safe voters are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point before - never has been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while 46 percent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population is experiencing a deterioration in the situation and only one tenth is expected to improve.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, a figure higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of the Government was doing better than his duties.
The 13 per cent of the consultants trusts or trusts much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 per cent of the consultants.
Some 54 per cent of the population do not fully trust the Chief of Government and some 27 per cent do not trust the President of the Youth Democrats Alliance.
One indicator of the political situation configuration is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change in government.
While after October last year's disturbances of 35 per cent believed that it would be desirable to maintain power in the Government and the Chief of Government, this proportion is currently only about 20 per cent, while the relative majority (approximately 33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of the respondents to the question of participation responded that they would certainly participate and another 20 per cent said that it is likely to participate.
In a comparative manner, "a general election to be held this Sunday" would certainly take place only 55 per cent of the population and another 15 per cent believe that it is likely to participate. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
One 74 per cent of the population would not approve the payment of study rights, one 79 per cent of the medical consulting services and one 84 per cent of the hospital care services.
If we only observed these proportions among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment by medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has multiplied its prices
They maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent of Budaörs's gold triangular supermarkets, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Mydság
This year also increased by an average of 16 per cent in the Budaörs gold commercial triangle the usual napi napi canaster, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the thousands of HUFs.
As in December last year prices had already "disappeared" in the supermarkets of food, so there was no percentage drastic anchoring compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obvious to consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the nine thousand HUFs, today they cannot do so even ten thousand.
Napi's basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that cana was 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish was kept almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in the strawberry, hazelnut and amapola seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found a pound of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-litre spare bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, including the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, regarding the Christmas prices of last year, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent of the prices in the Napi canada.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket last year with that of the cheapest basket this year, the difference has been 12 per cent, while the growth between the cheapest last year and the most expensive one this year has been 21 per cent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that last year's Christmas in prices felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were apparently unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the movement of a product, he may lose an important benefit in the margin that is adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes due to the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive of 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest case the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, as the highest price of the present year has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest one has also increased with 1284 HUF.
Compared with the two nave season, a catastrophic increase in prices was recorded in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent the price of first-needed consumer goods.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some first-needed foods, recorded an increase of more than 30 per cent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because at the price of this product that was quite expensive last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case, only 10 percent of the price increases.
According to all indexes, flour suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, which can impose the dramatic increase in prices even for multinationals.
The hypermarkets do not complain about the golden trade triangle, they constantly speak of positive results.
According to our experience, most of the consumers of the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Out of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved food by pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, the three shops formed large queues in front of the boxes because it suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that domestic sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to polling institutes because incomes are below their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it saves with disinfectants
This year, thousands of infections have been reported in hospitals, primarily due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The health conditions prevailing in hospitals, bed management and staff overload do not support the control of infections - says the head medical department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it even saves with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a infection with MRSA has been diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident hit him from the hospital, and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after the infection with MRSA and since then had not been able to perform an important surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered - said Karolina Böröcz, head of the Department of Epidemiology National Centre.
This means that in hospitals with all safety, this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has been recorded, and no information is available.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-oxacilin-resistant.
A third of humans carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
The infections caused by the SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis, skin infections, infections of the wound) respond well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once too much or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally respond well to antibiotics, turn into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and rapidly become infected in inadequate hospital conditions.
Severe hospital infections, such as infections of wounds or septicemia, may lead to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with the weakened body, elderly or persons with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistance
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff care for them in rubber and mask gloves and there are adequate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but not even this way the infection can be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA's hospital infections in most cases, but current national hospital conditions do not favour prevention of multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and isolate immediately the patients who carry MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, the use of microbiological samples is not fashionable.
This fact is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come out in public light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - the head doctor of the department of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to deal with diseases and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, that is, microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medications, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are still less frequent in the case of outpatient patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that, in most cases, MRSA is infected with each other through healthcare.
Therefore, the washing of hands, the use of rubber gloves and masks plays a very important role, but there are also considerable deficiencies in hospitals in this regard.
MRSA is infected by the transmission of drops and direct contact between individuals, but in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the hospital rooms are often covered, the beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation is saved with the disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are taken, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of infection with MRSA is a huge expenditure for the National Sickness Fund, which is why it is fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a downward trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholism of the police commander causing a fatal accident
The special official report has been made on the death incident caused by the commander of the 21st District Police.
It can be excluded from the possibility that he would lead a drunken or disturbed state since then released the commander of the 21st District Police, who on Tuesday struck and caused the death of a transeon - said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Capital Attorney General's Office, after the special report on the case had been prepared.
The report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholism that it had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of the District XXII, on Tuesday with his private vehicle by doubleing the Kossuth Lajos Street of the District XXII, attacked a 55-year-old man who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This last fact, i.e., that the pedestrian did not use the cable to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not attenuating circumstances, the driver should always give up the step by double.)
The transeont lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police communiqué, because he was greatly moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is under the responsibility of the Budapest Investigation Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limits agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of EUR 400 million to finance educational, transport and environmental infrastructures, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental projects, which will be made from the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had previously signed a credit contract of EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed for the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary's objective, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided at a later date, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, which will mainly be used by the budget for the project of innovation and research at the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that, when Hungary lasts with the EU the details of the Metro funding, they would re-examine the subject that if the original contract is necessary or not to be amended and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers an eight-year grace period without charge for maintaining the loan at the debtor's disposal.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed to that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who buy even cheaper in the EU market, will soon get stronger?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap ski resorts and beach chalets.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pampropo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the Albena beaches, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's central area - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also be able to awaken the interest of real estate promoters, and more and more people will buy real estate in Russia's particularly cheap area.
Similarly, Sofia's capital can be attractive, commercial spaces and offices promise a quick recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter.
Therefore, pre-empted investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy furniture in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in the ski resorts.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated buildings at a price between €50 and €100,000 or old homes in bad shape between €5 and €15 thousand, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, as well as the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor.
They constitute the second category buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope of using it in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is growing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21 per cent.
The increase in the price of buildings significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fuck and six percent Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gabor Fodor, meetings at expert level will be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue the ministerial negotiations on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are lively discussions on the particular situation between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not wish to negotiate precise figures, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020, greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by 25 to 40 per cent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to provide material and technological assistance to those countries that need it.
A further agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, as provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be directed by a steering board composed of 16 members, probably within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes "Piac is Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gabor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its avant-garde role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU undertakes to reduce by 2020, with respect to the 1990 level, by 20 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of whether or not the "after 2012" agreement will be signed and is willing to undertake to reduce even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to accept commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol had undertaken to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within that time the 15 EU Member States had committed to comply with an 8 per cent reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet - notes the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is a lot of what is at stake in Balí, since within two years the international climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be delayed by after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol, would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, whose need was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN international scientific association dealing with climate change, which obtained the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and could not be prevented by an increase of more than 2°C of the Earth's average temperature, which, according to scientists, would have unmistakable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruited on YouTube
The units of the British army in a video distributor publish recordings about actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAD) first took advantage of YouTube services: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on helmets are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations, then sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are 139 recordings from air force soldiers who have been loaded in this way on the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the United Nations Community (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the Ministry of Defence's opinion they also serve to present to the public the true goal of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - the BBC reported to the expert in defense of Gordon Mackenzie - in return, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to receptively edited and censored recordings, amateur videos appear in the distributor, such as about the death of soldiers: in the films of "official" propaganda, a few hypocrites, officials speak as much as possible of losses, without however presenting the bloodthirsty part of the fight.
In addition, many videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded from the battle camps of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with video shooting games, free downloadable, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tomb and salad pastel at the Christmas party of ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who can fire in 2007 with salad and coffee pastel.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its feast with live music, in another they will create the nave atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a thumb and a toast.
Feast, Christmas environment, concerts and buffet - so divide the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the workers of the Ministry.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for the Christmas of the Missionaries are invited to the families of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will target 25 million for the festive environment of the end of the year.
The National Agency for Promotion (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will have a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and the six hundred ministerial workers expected to be around three hundred and fifty.
At the portfolio party you will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, you will also act artists and there will be a lottery.
ANAF's fleet cost 4,700,000 HUF and held Wednesday in the National Judicial Administration Council (CNAJ) building with music concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party, which will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose, they rented the complete building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
Can Be Watched Without Dress
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF festival, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated Lucía's dance on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them charged nothing for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the Minister's greeting words and after the dinner there was dancing music live.
Answering the question of [origin] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear clothes or nightwear.
Health, work and local administration portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is not waiting for his colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a working meeting at the end of the year.
It is with the participation of a hundred and eighty guests who, as reported by the press department, will only take coffee and salad pastel, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply provide for his colleagues in the Ministry for Local Government and Territorial Development class.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own act room with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - this budget will pay for the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The farm portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and as the wallet reported, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception of foot, to which only qualified diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief address of the Minister's greeting and end with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the relevant press departments have communicated to [origin].
In the environment portfolio press department, they were unable to report on the budget for the ministry ' s Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held in the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will be a strike committee on Friday to coordinate the monthly strike that will last indefinitely.
A half of the protest will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the labor stop will begin.
With all certainty this action will cause great difficulties in transport, as the rail traffic will be stopped completely and up to 13 hours will also strike the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
The LIGA strike commission and the National Machinery Union will also be formed to coordinate Monday's actions.
A half protest will be held on Saturday, while the participating trade unions will speak on Monday in an indefinite strike, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law, they did not report on the date of the start of the strike.
If the National Assembly rejects the public health law, the trade unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible to vote only on public health law in the very hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of Monday's strike, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: the railways will stop working for an indefinite period, in the morning it may seem to be part of Budapest's collective transport and more than half of the interurban transport of buses from Volan companies.
At the same time, at many points in the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some trade unions announced their strike for an indefinite time, others for a defined time.
By the afternoon of Thursday, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach agreement on minimum services, although, as Christmas parties are approaching, more and more people are traveling on trains.
According to the information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m., workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m. will hold a four-hour strike, the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Teachers' Trade Unions called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Teachers' Union from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will be held in a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) which are part of the Forum for Trade Cooperation will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new concept to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force in the coming year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that in the case of advanced pensions, the occupations that claim it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Railway Workers Union (SLTF) that is part of the League Trade Unions do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the Hungarian Guard's activity, which was constituted in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased from several points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region.
The company's "risk warning" writes: in relation to the Hungarian Guard's biggest political risk, it is the fact that "with the worsening of the existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gitanian population in Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic confrontations may occur".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - it added the representative of the research institute.
They said that all this was due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political life leaders: "The protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Gitan problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, who could base their political strategy on the differences between the Roma and the Hungarians."
This increases the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of outbreaks of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the Institute of Research, the activities of the National Guard, as a result of the high attention of the national and international media, "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially as regards the country's stability and democratic development".
They remind us that since the fall of 2006, there has been increasing publicity and the reorganization of the radical and extreme right groups in Hungary and that since the summer of 2007, numerous organizations have been formed in the country that self-defined themselves as "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they self-define themselves as civil organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defense, national defence, public order defense), praising the ineptities of the police, the army, that is, the state" - add.
They said: all this is done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
You can highlight the civil society and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard's activity is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the Institute of Research, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way as the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) on the far right.
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gitans that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to be the guardian, arguing that the objective of the organization was "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "Gitanian terror" in Bulgaria, yet the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Capital Policy.
They added: this initiative has led to a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations that certain Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will be their own guardian.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the Hungarian gypsies react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
The Director of Political Capital Research Attila Juhász said on the news agency's question: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that may influence the change of risk, they inform the public opinion, as it happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the law accurately defines the days written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice that around the holidays - that the next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or in North America, the parties are united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, state party and festive days.
Feasting days are primarily related to religious festivals and historical ephemerides.
We also celebrated the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the last so that those who spent the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August we celebrated the founding of the State, on 1 May the working party, on 1 and 2 November we remember our families and friends who had died.
In addition, there are two days of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas holidays in our country.
According to the calendar, our national, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when there is one working day before or after the festival.
In exchange for the weekend so extended, you cannot leave work or school during the previous Saturdays.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day immediately preceding or after the party.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, because of their role, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can only be changed around the holidays of the end of the year: from 24 December, life is practically stopped in the country, because according to the experiences, most people "make bridge" during the holidays between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacations during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with the averages or weekends, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will first be changed around the working party so that, for four consecutive days, workers can rest.
On Saturday, April 26, it will be working days, so that Friday, May 2, will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the festival of 23 October: Saturday, 18 October, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the end of the year may rest, since from 24 December it will not work anywhere, even if the last day of the year is Wednesday.
Six little dissatisfactions to make your colleagues' lives bitter
E-mails that we forget to send, audio messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: they are all part of our Folklore" daily at work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to the small troubles or deliberately avoid the confusing situations that may irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they've been looking for you from the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to a date?
In the best case you feel it and try to repair the matter, you best call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by apologizing.
It is worth meditating on the things with which you can make your colleagues' lives bitter and conscious effort to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you want to get a document, a useful office or your phone and you don't find them.
Do you remember that you put the grabber on the table yesterday, but this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost handwriting on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they're going to get mad at you for distracting your stuff.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they get exhausted before the time.
Are you talking about your colleagues' private life?
There's no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with who?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information you have about your colleagues' private life!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his deepest secrets with you!
Fill in yourself what you have heard and don't joke about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know the things of him.
You're going to get a sick leave, aren't you?
When you call the office by phone and say you're sick and you're unbearably hurt your head, you feel bad or good, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; you think that others should do your job, your unbearable tasks, your job at the end.
Don't make fun of your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay home, communicate, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront you the next day.
Tarareos, laughs, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but do you suddenly get rid of it by your colleagues' jokes?
Have you ever heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarares, songs, voice conversations (less when you do them above your head), patals, constant blasphemy, expressing your discontents with your voice.
All of these may be annoying, although they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Don't call the chaos that possibly reigns in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
You feel too home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: Very comfortable for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don't look at a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be undressed, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so requires!
Loss of interest if you want to meet public expectations
The car moves slowly into the usual morning grip.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm getting the volume up.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones add the low and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 reproduces the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
National music life didn't bother us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems completely different when you're listening to the new Zagar disc.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2]digital [b3]national little by little are changing the image and although the rock style of the garage is fashionable again, guitars break, the national pop electro has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi group until he started his independent career maybe because both can't be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to win, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Törek Season).
The wider audience knew the whole that in principle acted only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 chose its first album published in 2002 among the 50 most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, able to sell in the Western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ass are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether they carry this label or not.
The set reacted how it should react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The recently launched disc, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, can open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the air, to the flight, but in addition to the air of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of the rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenary György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The disc includes a true success of the channel Mr2 Petõfi that lasts from the morning to the night popular music. This station has led to the ears of radio speakers the high flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Because everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: What is it that you are interpreting, to what extent is music dedicated to a selected audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of selected audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of casts in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
The so-called underground alternative music can also be boring, meaningless and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: In the foreign world, especially in the western part of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years are frequenting the concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that are taking place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good at seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is best felt in concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you're losing interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made his career to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with that of him.
We work on teams, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and there we started another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of successes of Mr. Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make great successes and sell with these successes our disk.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the most heavy themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a goose-style chorus.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of soloists with a good voice from our own national music scene.
This is how that choir was created by six women - either Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as the Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you actually compose the song or the girls have changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the disc, we thought that something was still missing.
The deal attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It came almost to the first attempt and incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divines.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the disc it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short only), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and not more strongly than music, so music does not just accompany their songs.
Also on the stage are located at the bottom.
What's your intention?
B.Zs: They're just in the background for technical problems.
Instead, we deliberately did not want to distribute soloist papers.
The song also reads about it, about which we forget a little bit of our ego, the one where it came from and where it goes, so let those wings, the wings of love raise us.
I would have liked to have others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which job have you dedicated to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition really none, but in the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little everything went to his place as a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I have already "solved" the disc.
Now the Prophet is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A stock exchange dealer riskes billions for its inferiority complex
A wicked traitor.
This is how former employee Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Generale, also owns the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself with his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
Intruded long ago, unlike all large Czech banks, the crisis on the American mortgage market.
"He's a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses, according to the French media broadcast, such as Le Monde's newspaper, is that it was a man who had a profit of more than EUR 1,600 million by his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was earn money for my bank" he assured in his answers.
It was precisely in the summer that it was able to win during the US crisis, EUR 500 million.
This opportunity has already come at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those that in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I've won my first 500 million I don't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses, adding, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had faked the records in such a way as not to reach his discovery.
He even tricked the bosses, even when the Eurex Bag began to be interested in his business.
The risk became a benefit
Was he afraid he'd find out?
Better, no.
"I thought I had won 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk it that way?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He joined the General Society in 2000, just after he finished studying in Lyon.
Its annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a Boxa runner's assistant, and in 2005 he became a purse runner with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I'd never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already noticed that I was being watched carefully.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing a low title of EUR 500 million.
And this submitted a starting mechanism, and I wanted more.
If you win, we'll let you go.
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it's said that the bosses knew about all this or that they suspected it.
"As he made money, he closed his eyes."
Only then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, I wanted to delete all traces.
When Monday came to work, I was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did they locate him?
He became suspicious from his holidays.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file," Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can reach EUR 14 billion (approximately EUR 365 billion).
It is practically half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of the seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will be available for the regions.
The Czech companies can get around 100 billion crowns from the Company and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructures which will have a total of 90,800 million crowns next year.
The Business and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources for business innovation.
Businesses should receive funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly-owned countries that use them less.
Twenty-year sentence for the President of Nicaragua, the court ruled
The Nicaraguan Appeals Tribunal decreed on Thursday the 20-year penalty for the country's president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the decommissioning of $100 billion (approximately $1,800 million crowns).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest in his farm not far from Nicaraguan metropolis.
There is nothing clear at this time, according to AP agency that then the head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002 is back in the ranks.
According to the President of the Appeals Tribunal, Ileana Pérez, he will depend more on the prison officers if they let Germany end their punishment at home or if they bring him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated that Germany was constantly transferring government money to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fiction and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government's vote of confidence, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although most influential, quietly passed the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget departure, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it conceals the rivalry of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media and is therefore given special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats have suffered from three defects that it is not possible to resolve so easily by this year 2008:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called the expenses of the mandaters who are not only pensioners but also the social benefits that were approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the economic deficit as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money taxes, rates and bank credits, often issued disproportionately obligations with which they were disproportionately indebted to their municipalities.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we are concerned only with the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, is going through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, in what is called ČSSD.
This was the ideal occasion for your government to order the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, especially in the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been inundated with enormous measures in recent years.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditures approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform were not changed, then it would be the end of any policy in this country and the government who governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
We can say that politicians who rule will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on normal expenditures of the mandaters.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the last government had not wasted over the past ten years what they could have done.
We do not want politicians who rule to become only officials, so we must be patient and give this weak coalition of government, which is realized that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and fees, the calmness for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the Monetary Market, more than one hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders.
In these tenders, banks are undermining the types of interest for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the US Fed will send to bid $40 billion, and then the other $20 billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continuous growth in the free capital gap that banks could lend," said Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers, Economic Outlook Group consultant.
"This coordinated action of central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on loans committed, especially in the United States.
Economists are still waiting for billions of losses.
"The central banks must really be afraid of what is still waiting for them when they decide to take this step," said ABN's chief economist Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same access problems to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after not being able to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, the London Interbank tariff used for the money loan in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid of lending money even when the US, Canada and Britain's Central Banks reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest" said to the agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the move by the central banks contributes to the outbreak of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is particularly affecting developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed himself in relation to the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the conclusion of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of the environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are only structured, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes from the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy to discover his book translated into German because, as he said, "I find myself often only with the cartoon of my ideas."
Interested people can now be informed about their diverse views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but has, in his opinion, enough supposed to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closing, he expressed his view that the climate was constantly changing and that its changes were normal, that there was no agreement between scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes were not so great and serious, nor were possible disasters and that attempts to influence climate development were ineffective, ineffective and cost-effective.
Furthermore, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental defenders, but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people didn't get to change their driver's sheep
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and therefore did not reach the end of the year to change their old car to drive.
Today is the last day when people can ask for the change so that officials can get them to the end of the year to issue the new carne.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the new Year they will be found on the hundreds of thousands of drivers without the valid meat.
According to traffic, the meat has not changed mainly those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While peoples announce a rapid decline in meat exchange, metropolis offices are full of requests and interest in the new meat has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 customers per day.
There's a half-hour waiting in the queues.
The new carne has not yet been removed in Prague by around 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new meat lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the meat within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case, the driver must pay fifty crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their meat and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid meat will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay up to two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the crime with a warning.
If it is an administrative infringement, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the previous information, a fine could be received by that person who is not going anywhere.
They could probably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry called on the offices to enter fines of a thousand crowns at the maximum.
According to the spokesman for the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving sheep is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the flesh of identity that each person must have.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the meat to drive.
Just bring it or send it by email certificate to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year the meat issued during 1964 and 1993 ceases to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of meat to drive.
Persons with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the meat issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the punishment for Berdych's complicit detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a final judgment to reduce the penalty, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The department's detectives were being harassed for organized crime, in principle, between 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision, only through the revocation of the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also in this accused case but he is first awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
In spite of this, a total of 16 years has already been sentenced in other proceedings.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the capture of 19 persons and the higher court, today, withdrew 16 of them.
Most of the accused's accusations were rejected by the investigation for the alleged cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group to avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft and Opava and Konňarík.
The charge refers to the criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts but were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without the permission of weapons.
In the home register, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals reportedly stole tens of millions of crowns.
Except for almost twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and others guilty.
Other men related to the Berdich case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pót and Maroš Shulej, who for the time being have avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Trebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is not in principle in line with Veleba's proposal.
"That request we do not approve, it is too high," said Dostál after today's meeting.
"In order for us to have an idea of this counterproposal, we need the expert's report that the counterparte had to investigate.
We'll find out if he has a receptory value.
We keep ourselves in the view that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál stressed.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jablon’s family wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating the compensation of the expert's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol School Hospital in Prague.
Children's parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered from psychological impact and stress at different levels and depth.
The situation of stress was better supported by men, although they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women bring him worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses in the Maternity House of Trebič last year, on December nine.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola and the Čermákový and Primbyslavic, and Veronica and Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Milosz Vystrčil, delivered 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation for the error in the Trebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by law as liability for damage.
In the event of errors, they should withdraw from the reserve fund and may exceptionally ask for help from the administrator.
The court has so far recognized them as a proportionally low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the argument about the Kingdom brand of Valaquia.
According to Ostrava Provincial Court of Justice, it was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka did not present herself today in the oral view.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will resume.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the trial, the lawyer of Polívka.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone sees the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for about ten years of work.
Looking for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A profit-making business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Valaquia was first used by Polívka on its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
So it was not about guiding him to the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš had the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comical origin, Haraviš was a profitable business and business activity from which he later created the Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of its name and signature in passports and even offered its owners discounts to visitors of its farm and visitors to its shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today the judge also determined that Haraviš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for its own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project, Harabiš and his team were fully devoted to it.
The collaboration, among today's discomposed parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, conflicts have begun between Polívka and Harabiš, whose culmination has come with the overthrow of the "king Boleslav I, elected forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, came in the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his society, which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could lead to the fight, the tournament by the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not want to disclose any more data or dates.
"We don't have any rush.
It should be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king should be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Overrun prejudices
To tell the truth, I've never liked Peugeot 206.
Its walking characteristics were never special, the quality of the change box, manoeuvre and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is in the market your successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little bit more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because Combi's carriage means in this sense, which I'm not going to suffer in front of the two feet in length.
Flying for the World
I walk through the interior quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention even though the car already looks pretty elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backs.
Unlike model 206, lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the bodywork have grown.
In Combi, the so-called lack of space in the head disappears.
Bags in the suitcase
But the main thing in this vehicle is your suitcase.
This must be valued as very accessible ( thanks to the back port abatable) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber belts that provide an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of subjecting heavy objects.
But we stayed in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in the basic regime it has a capacity of 428 litres, which is rather an average value compared to competition.
But not in comparison with the same type of vehicle most sold in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that Peugeot stays in the frog with its detectable 52 liters.
From vacation to abroad or when placing the child's coach, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I should quote the floor that's pretty flat after falling off the back of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car test was equipped with a four valve injection fire over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to say the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that would despise the family five doors.
It's silent, it consumes little and above all, it has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the damage of that time that seemed as if the escape tube was stuck by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices Answer
The car price is not for all pockets.
We must, however, take into account that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with an injection fire of 1400 by 329.900 crowns is still possible.
Our aggregates have put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Just that we would still have airbag in the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic cleaning, automated rear windows...
In other words, the car with everything costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it's with the Fabi team's plug-ins and it's going to get to a pretty similar number.
Now it's only left to decide which of the two marks.
Slovak students do not join English schools
In English schools, children from countries in Eastern Europe attend, and that is why locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans by now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and brothels between students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam's police arrested a Slovak woman who was taking sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In his defense he said that the girl was insulting her son with insults of racist tone.
The police also had to act after a two-year-old attack against a Slovak immigrant.
The girls hung him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to leave it, he made us the breath of throwing apples and feathers, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his back," described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be rather tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks registered who came here for work reasons.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be fulfilled, if you choose correctly.
Plays arenas and golden, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all included with shrimps offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf course.
In the Caribbean Sea Island you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the Great Antilles islands.
In the Spanish era, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Colón called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo of the treasures that the Spanish brought out of America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew at the end of the 20s.
He ordered to build one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was crime in the United States (and therefore forbidden) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among their guests were others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, with wide avenues running the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had its yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left its signatures the stars of the world of the show and politicians of all America.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita apanese you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel National mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars have already been used in the 1950s, so far they continue to work for Havana, because those La Lada and Fiat who have arrived long ago have been oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even when La Habana, in particular the old neighborhood, is deteriorating significantly, there are not so many wonderful colonial monuments around it as well.
Other places are metamorphosis in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last 15 years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the single world and is highly appreciated by the lovers of railway.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar factories by narrow lines in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for decades have not been discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose brothers' models that are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where are you going?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And for that, there is no need to talk more about La Habana or Varadero.
Maybe, just remember that in Hemingway's already mentioned farm there is a museum that for those who are writers' lovers, they should not stop visiting it.
The Vignales valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in rock lands.
Mogots, chalice stone pillars and high-spared rocks in the valleys, and in their caves acclimatize fertile lands thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where tobacco of the highest quality is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the pure hapanera factories can be found with your final product.
It may seem interesting to someone that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was around there.
Trinidad
Old Aboriginal city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beautiful with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Serra de Escambray, is such a separate place that in the 50th century there was no road to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built, and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than just one evening, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as the Ancón Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by its own path.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that only knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a Humanity Heritage by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Cross of Colon (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Café, ron, pure, Sierra Maestro, the Bay of the Cooks and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Copper, the Santeria, the African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could fill many pages.
However, as it is said, it is best to see it at some time.
The allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment are influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as expected, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country met in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, eight participating states today discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase their activity, Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development only," said BBC's Defence Minister, Des Browne.
Ninety per cent.
The activity of Afghan rebels according to US military data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased from 27 per cent last year, and in Helmand Province up to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, four of whom are south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of unit organization and equipment.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar way, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke today.
"I am not glad to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have nine hundred soldiers and teams we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told the Reuters agency at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the participating countries in recent months, there has been a debate as to whether all allies do their utmost in Afghanistan.
It was criticised for passively, for example, Germany.
"Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a minimum area of violence and the requirements for fighting there are not as high as in our, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun called the German soldiers blind this week.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing the table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British team played a rugby party in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech State, the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842,700 million crowns in September.
This year the government planned to lend 159,200 million crowns.
In early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns by improving the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew at the end of September to 842,700 million crowns.
In nine months this year it increased by 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13,400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of the Economy confirmed its debt status data in early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the State owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year, we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900,000 million and the billion crowns," said to the iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees it: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
That is precisely when this will depend on the next budget we do not know yet.
If the situation in the political scene changed and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed in 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
The Doubt Grows
The debt of the state creates debt in the central government and, above all, arises from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The debt of the State is paid by means of treasure bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt grew from 38,500 million to 719,400 million crowns this year.
External debt for the moment has grown from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The so-called debt of the state negotiable at the end of September contained 803,300 million z crowns since June was reduced to 13,700 million crowns.
The average government debt maturity increased by 6.5 years.
"The total interim debt of the first to the third quarter created 13 percent of what is enormous given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all of the obligations where there is a growth of 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora commented.
Better Than Expected
Out of the state debt strategy and debt management for 2007, it is clear that the government planned this year to lend 159,200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152,800 million crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount consists, in particular, of the deficit in the state budget which this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91,300 million crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with approximately 13 300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payments, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1,800 million crowns in payments from the European Investment Bank.
I compared today before a court in Khartoum to have given a name to a bear
The British professor who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, said his lawyer.
The British was accused of letting students between 6 and 7 years of age give Mahomet's name to a bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was a pain in the ass.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the United High School of Khartoum in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday at his home and accused of assaulting Islam and of being incarcerated, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years of age, to choose a name for the class pelvic bear.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed " , the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children from each 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have produced a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the next legend " My name is Mohamed " .
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, professor at the same school in Sudan, insisted that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that might be offensive to a religious faith, "I feel I have only asked children to vote for a name " , it is according to him only an "innocent error " .
Opinion divided by many students from the school teacher who describe it as "very attentive to their students " and " who never speaks of religion in class."
We remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most named in Britain, written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, an issue of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences about the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not expect violence for now but enter a very difficult period " , he added, noting that " obvious tensions exist " .
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council from here to 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last of the negotiations since the troika had been tasked with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
The US and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing the negotiations beyond this peak date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration of the UN in Kosovo, the West consider that independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
" Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden hotel, where these "opportunity negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his weights.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to murders and deportations".
" Effect dominated"
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered a commitment always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence in the province.
Belgrade said in particular to fear a " dominant effect " in a region that was still weakened by the 1990s' independence wars.
" For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a right of veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
" Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted for two years.
It must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral statement of Albanian independence would be " in consultation " with the West.
Bush launches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference itself held on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
It was necessary that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to negotiate immediately in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything to help them complete a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must disarm " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, recalling their obligations with respect to the peace it took in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This designation covers the three main dangerous problems of the contentious point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be " global and in-depth" and referred to in all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things ".
On his way back to the court, Olmert committed himself to what the upcoming negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and to do "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008.
Bush set at the end of 2008 the end of the implementation of its " two-State " Palestinian and Israeli vision co-existence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort in this regard by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, led by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a confrontation point in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , says Prince Saud in his Arabic periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As often in this kind of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the French National Police General Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car circled on Sunday, shortly after the 17th, Louisa-Miguel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
" I was not in intervention but in patrol, and I was walking 40-50 km/h, without a rotating light " , explains a police source.
A green motorbike from the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
" He beat the police car on the left side, after a failure of the front door to the right " , the police said.
The control of alcoholism practiced on the occupants of the vehicle has been shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the front ungrounded, aggressed, booted parachute) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary murder and denial of aid " to the IGPN, co-ordinated with the departmental government of the security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that IGPN's investigation, at this stage, dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the police, namely that this minima cycle reached their left relatively quickly " .
Yesterday, a type of runaway, no doubt caused by the kicking of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been framed in time for the police car to stop.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor came about quickly by Villiers-le-Bel, which said the police would have gone very quickly from the site, not offering support to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also separate " any serious defect " from this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of research, which requires more research, which must be very careful " , required a police source.
Liberation found an eye witness of these moments who followed the accident.
One of your windows that just gives the scene.
"Let's go down then, with my cousin who's nurse to the hospital, to try to reanimate them, tell this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a completely disappointed police officer, who was picking up.
Two others were trying to reinvigorate one of the young, the fourth was talking to the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and it seems certain that the young people were present, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
According to this witness, reliefs arrived " almost twenty minutes after the police march " .
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that police services did not assist young people.
These young people have been helped.
The bombers arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension goes up in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by the tear grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The last of these guys replicated stones, wounding the cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been intertwined.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (Northeast).
The movement of lawyers gathered Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president " urged the population to send flowers to the judges who had pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the losses they had sworn to in front of Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Supreme Court of Pakistan refers directly to the exception declared on Saturday afternoon.
I had to speak in the next few days about the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
" All we attend is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's findings," the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president " no longer values " after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Monday to the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform here as of 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government dismissed insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or accidental births.
Today, more than one pregnancy per three (36%) is not expected, it reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or accidental births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still present a failure rate of 5 % to 6 %, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed a better " fertility domain " , according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 was from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births of every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little or less per month for a couple of every five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a depleted and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, instruments "captured" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the harmony module from the Discovery launcher, a cylindrical thick piece to quickly host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landfill for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity generation module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a size of 76 metres.
And it's where one of the panels, which spread like accordions, has been damaged in a little bit more or less than a meter by a cable that dragged itself.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who had at first performed a control output of the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who's been chosen to go to the end of the 30 meters length of the teledirectional arm of the launcher added to the station to make the repair.
It's one of the best spacewalker (space walker) in the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "operating" the solar panel "harmed".
After precisely inspecting the damage, he sectioned the defective cable and installed "tables" types in the damaged area.
He had helped him the second spacewalker who had stayed close to the airlock and, from within, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool used, a hockey minibaston wrapped with an insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels producing several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapped" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launcher to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title of EADS sanctioned in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently under way in the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to EUR 21.96 in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays due to the slow progress of the A400M engine, which corresponds to the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of halting the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to " between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the European manufacturer's home EADS.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new exploitation results (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adding no more precise figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS’ operating result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to the delays of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No one is surprised on Sunday, at the exit of the urns: the Russians will opt massively for President Putin's party, united Russia.
Confirming your desire for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending the voters today a television message on public chains, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be seen receiving foreign ambassadors, happy to deliver a new charge against the accused of interference - his theme of pre-election during the campaign.
" We know the price of real democracy and wish for more, more transparent and more open elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Report a pressurized campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is " never had such a dirty election, until the time of Eltsin " .
After the repression of the last weekend's demonstrations, the former champion of Jaque Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet man"
Following these unsurprising legislative elections, two more open questions are identified:
Who will happen to Putin’s presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to become known.
elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Is the leader of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful Russian party united that would elect the government and the president?
In any case, legislative elections as well as presidential elections will be won by the outgoing power.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet man, do not feel they own his destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kokossov, from the state university of San Petersburg, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin re-established the model of a paternist state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic downturn " , estimates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " by their own will " give up personal responsibility " of those who had recently proved after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they will not vote for the extremists either.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko's conclusion, 54-year-old professor: "Why reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million file documents, stored over 27 km of containers in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far consultable only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his rightholders.
The eleven States responsible for its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to the searchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement has been completed by all States, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for searches " particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers " , explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Red Cross Commission (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, have opposed the opening to the public of these nominations, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Just like the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of some of the deportation victims.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or subject to compulsory work and, where appropriate, to give them proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees treat tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free exchange agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade is already around EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner pointed out to Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
Foreign Ministers of the European Union had passed their approval in April to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
Lue is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th European Union trade partner, according to the figures of the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will provide a great deal of both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner specified. The Asian and European giants change annually by " 47 billion euros of goods " and " ten billion euros of services ", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade " has not yet reached its potential." The European Union and India are on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England was concerned on Thursday to alleviate the current turn of credit concerns, and announced an offer of 10 billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75 per cent in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns that the conditions of the financial market will be particularly acute at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its provision of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , indicates in a statement.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, at the basic index and until 10 January.
This is the first time the UK bank seems to place liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain interbank loan indices daily with its basic index.
The interbank rate per day was on Wednesday, 5,829 %.
The rate after three months was 6.6%, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important criminality index that has deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the euro-related pound, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, to the most favourable indices and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC Parties refuse to consider the PS Party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre group refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power on Thursday, which is equivalent to a depreciation of the text.
As part of a socialist 'niche' (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text delineated a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including an increase of 50 % of the overtime for employment, the re-establishment of the TIPP (internal rate for oil products), a check-transport or the restrictions on rentals.
Since the UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was raised at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between the majority and the opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft rectification finance law examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes out
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Wineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, or at least, the current movement of festivals in America," entrusted Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival should take place from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Another time known under the name of Mean Fiddler, director of the Republic Festival Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead in the United Kingdom Reading Festival, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Ben added the Leeds Festival to its portfolio, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of " more inspiring event " that he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style event festival.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level policies because of the current administration, pursuing Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that will last take place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being demarcated in the scenery of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded their gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a camp festival, while ours are done better in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to simultaneously give an impression of camp festival in the European and urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The Vineland community, including the mayor, wholeheartedly supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but claims " that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we expect, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", for example the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
It says that invitations have been launched to groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
" Vineland will have the taste of rock, but music will vary there, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His colleagues from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to attract the Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing else than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation's functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the runaway productions.
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where to go.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The Race to Festivals
At the moment, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of the film here.
The race to the Oscars is beginning.
All the festivals of the West Coast, namely the Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and make sure that the performers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on a poster to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in a bag? The experts, divided by the 'subpress' crisis.
Less than five weeks to cancel the closing of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional rally to arrive at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so clear that this is going to be produced.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December in a stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made based solely on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties have reached markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not parties to the stock exchange in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the flow to quality values in both long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline of the Fed types is not known, given the high level of cruelty and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," the expert assures.
Ibex has lost close to 4% of the peaks marked on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Still not all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closest to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert argues that things will be something different this year, as he believes that the rally will progress in the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the trend of the market.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banko, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebuff of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
Analysts agree on the time to choose the values to be taken to Ibex to new maximum rates.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it touches the great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banko, assures that the rise will come from the bank and industry.
Constructors may also benefit from this rally if they are given.
"The ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other builders like Ferrovial and FCC to follow their own path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be a leading factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although there is not much representation in the Spanish market in this case.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times in December has been a Basilica month.
The genuine end-of-year rally was lived in 2003, the exercise in which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the pinchage of the technology bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a 6.68 per cent return.
You will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profit (Ibex is currently up 8.36% since January) and if you can count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew most of its offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to jump to the uninterrupted opening of their agencies by 20.30 a.m. and open the Saturdays 10 a.m. to 20.30 a.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of their offices on Saturdays instead of opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the People's experience will be crucial for other entities to focus on this initiative, whether or not according to trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal that is pursued by Popular with the project.
Catch the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomouss and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open all over Spain in about 18 months, as there are no new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise the branches already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the various streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new, more up-to-date design with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Angel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not constitute a major investment, although a larger recruitment of staff, since it is no longer possible to have about six employees locally to eight or nine.
Offices, which will even have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Angel River.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Grand Via de Madrid have been elected, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And other 60 who operate under the World Credit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open Sundays and holidays.
In these places of PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with outside staff at the bank.
Telefive doubles for the first time the value in your racing bag Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase, he expressed his satisfaction yesterday with Paolo Vasile, deputy adviser to Telecinco, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain leading doubled the value of his rival, Antenna 3.
It was only one aspect of his joy: 'it's what I'm sorry, it's not because we've grown up more than because we've fallen less', he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54 per cent advance.
That profit is the loss in what we carry year by year in 15.66%.
The value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participating by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a 40.5% decline since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of other listed communications companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (Finco Days editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing.'
Telecinco announced last week that it was planned to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that manages the group's advertising.
If this data was made available, the television channel would record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing of 965.4 million in 2006.
Antenna 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exercise (to reach 734.4 million) while net TV revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that points analysts to the best relative evolution in Telecinco Bag is the high payout that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit to its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is ready to make the decision, this ratio could vary after buying 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we are able to leave our shareholders happy, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at these moments of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and 7% in 2009.
It should be explained that the expected growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same signature has reduced Antenna's profit forecast by 3 and 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
At the same time as its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and consensual the best regulation in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of entities for the efficient functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, is intended to modernise financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new regulation will enable financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized and legal firms and to create a new type of financial service signatures (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which are joined by value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of financial instrument operating systems, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services undertakings to disclose information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management, and requires them to keep a record of all their operations in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its move by the Congress' Economic Commission, several amendments were incorporated, including stressing that titled debt is considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by the US high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that diplomats can develop in Economics and Business 30 years after the real decree delimiting the professional functions reserved to economists was passed in 1977.
The Senate, for its part, incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on an external basis, will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and may provide its product and customer marketing services to various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised IPC increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to integrate it into the European Union's inflation rate calculation, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide timely and quality comparable data to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the Employee for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information from which it is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be made known on 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The Vice-President of Economics, Pedro Solbes, has said that the rise in 4.1% of the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has hoped that the price index will continue at relatively high levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in Congress' corridors that "even though the figure is not good" the difference between Spain's inflation in respect of monetary union is still "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that "there was less surprise" in November than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure around 4%," said the Minister of Economy regarding the advanced data today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50 per cent to 12 billion pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, he was making a record deposit of over 25 billion pounds, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the distrust of his clients, and despite the guarantee of a hundred percent of that money that the Government offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British bank revenues deposited in the next three years to get those 18 billion remaining books to reach the goal of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson Magnet Group, known for its so-called advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about EUR 70 million) annually in advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virginia consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has now stopped at the first hour of the morning to the current mayor of Totana Murcia (the People's Party) for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot this week.
In addition, one of the secretariats and the head of the City Police have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current popular MP, and until then the mayor of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by the SER chain, it could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers continue to register municipal units and urban councils and no more detentions will be discarded in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, was charged at the beginning of this week.
Just as yesterday, the Ser Chain reported to the 'popular' MP' lawyer Juan Morales, so far away, he was stopped from the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of research, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions instead of facilitating the signing of a urban agreement with a galega construction company to re-equate 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE's candidacy by Toledo and chair the Congress if they win
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced by the Secretary of the Organization of the OSCE, José Blanco, and the Bono himself, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of the Executive has justified the offer to the former Minister because "it is important to count the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes" the manchego politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace the President of the Congress with Manuel Marín, who published his decision on 15 November last not to present himself to the next general elections and to abandon his career in active policy to fight climate change in the university field.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting on returning to political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as citizens know who will be the vice-president of the economy if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress in a "transparency act".
If you get the job, Bono is hoping to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or of shouting" and make it "seems more and more to the citizens".
"Sometimes regrettably it seems that the only place in Madrid where you cannot speak peacefully and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government on one occasion interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not want to see himself occupying his position anymore so as not to fall into what, he noted, his opponents might see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to immisericord persecution, both to the skeptics of its predictions and to those prioritising other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron consistency.
And more than one leader of the movement that is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach requires him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government, has made a decisive contribution to the EU's failure to comply with Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the failure, in what sectors has occurred and why his Government, the one from the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires the Spanish to explain with full clarity what measures are being taken to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, whoever will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Costless, uncomfortable and threatening for business accounts and individuals.
Even the cent of the gas suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful to electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor complains nor demands, but he adores myths and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend to move on a bicycle or refresh with the abanico.
Arrested by the mayor and local police chief of Totana for a alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the mural town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the City Secretary and a host entrepreneur for possible urban offences, have reported today sources of research.
The Edil was arrested in his home and was transferred to the Consistency, where he is now located alongside numerous agents, who have also visited the Urban Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalculation of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanization so that the Galega Nuaria company builds 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but were charged in the summary, which instructed Judge No. 1 of Totalana.
The first six detainees have now passed to court.
According to the sources reported, the former governor of Totana and today the MP, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former director, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in Niger (Ponteverra), as was Paul José M.G., director of Suelo de Immonauar, an agency integrated into the mentioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a highly known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing the largest residential complex in Totana's Murcian municipality, which would assume the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autessa and Inomonar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages existing parking on the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando El Católico square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

If it seems to them, we are going to let the Book of the Month rest, see if there is another 'premiology' and other powers in the meantime.
I'm already missing something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent facilitates this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by default, the head of the PISA report on education in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of the book Blackburn:
"The content of the signing of Philosophy has jumped into public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the death, a bachelor student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser responsible for the assignment of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague provides information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a crime of six months a year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs in the store of less than EUR 400, you are simply considered to be missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1,000 in the shop, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than the charge for the download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the download (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous reindeer has a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone is being handed, a very long hand.

My head doctor gives me one of his rare research articles entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what fellow workers earn.
The study has been conducted through magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognitive Image Group of the Institute of Life&Brain, Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that if both received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkans Tax
Carla del Ponte has been pursuing the Balkan war criminals for eight years without delay since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go with an agricult taste, because the chief leaders of the Srebrenica killing - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain in freedom.
Its names are on that list, which is titled the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not drawn in Spain), who, at the pace of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to prosecute the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance do I get?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in front of possible sinesters, is an important cost that will depend on several factors, such as age, sex, the age of the car, the status of the car, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of the car, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured company.
This commitment is materialized in a insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for the liability of the obligation to pay the premiums in the case of a branch.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors such as age, sex, age of the car, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use of the car, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that they are more likely to suffer an accident, more likely to be charged.
That is why both the 25-year-olds and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of punitiveness because of their caution.
Also, by removing the accounts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of perch.
The increase in frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various disadvantages when hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the meat.
Although the ideal for being well-secured is a risk-free insurance, there are other more economic options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a whole risk with frankness, so that they can obtain the coverage of a insurance at all risk but at a more affordable price.
This kind of agreement would assume that the customer pays part of the amount of the sinester.
"The share of the amount of the customer's subscription will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be the higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the top manager in Spain of First Europe, online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
An advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid sinisters as much as possible, as this will impact on the bonus, reducing the cost of insurance in the future.
A subsidy is a reduction over the basic tariff that the company owns.
On the contrary, criminalization is a charge on that basic tariff.
"The benefits and penalties will depend on the company and on its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it may be possible to increase the subsidies," Noguera explains.
Over the last 25 years, drivers have the easiest time to hire insurance, as the index of pedestrianity is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to hire a whole risk with frankness.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident, and even at the time of driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'novel fear' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows, it is clear.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by the insurers as the public with a lower rate of pedestrianity, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk (which could be EUR 300), or, when there is a high level of bonus, one at thirds expanded from the third year of the life of the vehicle.
"They conduct a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury to take on a greater number of franchises," Luis Noguera says.
For pensioners, a risk-free insurance (being EUR 150) is recommended, or one extended to third parties when a high level of bonus is available.
It has to be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in front of possible signs, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic search for a point worth eight in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions league, as Italians serve to be first and Scottish to judge their classification.
The Italians add up ten points and on the fifth day they certified their passage with a stamp in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another one to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and receives the Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D parties will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to compete with the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on Day 13 in semifinals in search of a square by the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and empathise at Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in October.
In the whole of Gordon Strachan could even serve a defeat to classify himself if Shakhtar did not win, but could not be trusted because at nine points the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the night bitter for the Scottishs, who trust in getting into eights for the second time in the restructured Champions League and in a consistent way, after being precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the journey.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar only worth the triumph, in the event that the Celtic loses, both to get into the eighths and to follow in the UEFA.
And it is that, despite being the last and no choice to follow in the European maximum competition, Benfi could achieve the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first round since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "blizzant".
About 20,000 people were exhausted to attend the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that raged at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that gathers its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes the EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went out to the stage with some bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the audience that seized GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had been banned days earlier.
In front of the show's start, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British astrologer "has not seen our dress for anything, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', whose departure from the group in 1998 "by differences between us" caused the resolution of the fiftieth two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the show began.
"He was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I've made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that in time, "the things have been settled and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
At his arrival at the airport, an army of children was waiting for him.
Of the five, seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (5 and December 7).
They will act in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced the supply to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to wake up the amount of money that Ukraine should pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would charge Ukraine more, as it has committed itself to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might be that Ukraine pays 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on transit rates levels [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly increased prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply with Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian nations.
NHS "will have to test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal record records of employees outside Europe, one observer said.
The recommendation of general auditor Robert Black came after it was proved that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel it counts with.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are properly carried out through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the number of foreign personnel employed outside the European Economic Area as a result of attacks at the airport in Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after hitting a jeep at the doors of the terminal building of the airport.
He was one of the three doctors who acted in the Old Bailey video conference in October, accused of alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks for candidates to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out checks on criminal record, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report of the general auditor recommends, inter alia, that the Boards should have the lead of the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that information is available in the number of foreign NHS personnel."
The president of the BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential employees of NHS who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number could be higher, in part because the boards have problems identifying which employees have unlimited residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing foreign pre-employment policy and guidance in the NHS.
The Health Secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "I had a great interest in this work as a result of the terrorist attack at the airport of Glasgow.
He added that the Scottish government, together with health boards, could consider reporting recommendations and that this would be reflected in the update of pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates movie awards
Control, the movie about Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award to the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for Director Anton Corbín and co-partator Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was best named actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British movie on the international stage.
The awards were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control continues to increase Curtis' reputation with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - with the sound band of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds.
But also won the Dutch photographer Corbín, already known by the iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree of U2, won with two prizes – the best director and best debutor director.
The rock music was the center of another award at the ceremony – like Julien Temple's film on The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist – won the best documentary award.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a head of the Russian mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promises of the East.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing hard, received Richard Jarris' award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently films the sequence of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Cave".
Winston said he was proud to receive that prize, so appointed in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, dead in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
Independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and musicians include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Sea Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arresting 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The world's largest oil supplier state television said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
An eight-military cell consisting of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the province of the East, reported the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaq, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, quoting a statement by the Minister of the Saudi Interior, said that 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles to the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in arresting the Saudis travelling to Iraq to join as militants in Al-Qaeda to fight against the Allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heir to the most extreme Saudi Sunny.
Al-Qaeda militants are looking at many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to visit the country's pro-Western government - had as objectives foreign residences associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, five months ago," said the spokesperson for the interior minister to state television.
The detainees also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "the takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Suni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of supporting and financial support to the militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship in orbit showed the planet more like a Earth jewel than it had previously seen.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
Both planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the winter effect, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is erosiond by hurricane winds and rays storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics of Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is clear why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when there are two similar planets.

Police dismissed "rich uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was decommissioned yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The officer could not confirm whether he was enriched uranium but said he could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy of presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow mono.
However, Republican presidential candidates may agree to hold a discussion on YouTube, where common voters and currents record video questions and send them to broadcast among the candidates.
None of the questions presented in the afternoon of Wednesday, 28 November were more ridiculous than the one of the snow mono which asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party face to the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show the candidates to aspire.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to one theme, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas that they would like to hear: the issuers noted approval points when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The worst word exchange of the night was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in Iowa and New Hampshire's crucial surveys.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
The junior candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the subject.
No one has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of China’s toxic toys and other external concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked whether the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he literally did not believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee -now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism, said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, the laugh saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increased in Iowa, coincident with the funding campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements of Wednesday's debate.
Both have left the bottom, because the two winges of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both winges of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have been sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor do they smell extramarriage fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich man of business has worn out contributions to the English laborist government party, more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars), for about four years using false names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister chose to call an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by stating that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democratic leader with growing intelligence, because the frightened Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative chapter.
One-third of retired generals started a motion in the Lores Chamber, protesting against the military spending cuts: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a medium-time job.
Now it's David Abrahams' multiple donations; Peter Watt, the secretary-general (and former colleague) has already given up.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is heading irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can get to an inflexible point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, which he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is put on the defensive and does not focus.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that it is new.
Although I wanted to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as the chancellor of the error.
And even when it is not directly involved in Blair's contracts - or "effective for partners", research into the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one's dead, no one's been cheated directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compared his donations to gifts of charity, said he did not want public recognition for his well-being.
This may be the case, but the decision does not take it.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said that he knew of the agreement of Mr. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising, who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these actions, even though the bulk of payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it is diluted in the decision-making process by a family matter, a committee of inquiry into the matter - conducted, to a good extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Commission on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one for six months and must also press for genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a hard cooperative work of the workers with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation of the trade unions - bitter measures for a party like Mr Brown.
But he has to deal with some party facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; they are two years old to win voters; and the only way they can move to victory is to act with an impeccable probability and solid competition.
Card Games
Is the mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal alts swim around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes placed on the credit card market in the country.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis undermines other forms of consumer credit.
Contagion signs are already seen.
There is an increase in card charges and crime rates, measuring the proportion of balances that have not been amortised or that have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million positions in its US consumer financing business, partly due to the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Mortality and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American People's Breakage Act (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in the failure requests, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of stupidity) would be growing again, or could happen that the conditions for the borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is pretty strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are running out.
But credit card issuers look at liquidity flows more than active values, so that the falling prices do not necessarily change the creditor's credit capacity.
They can even work to benefit the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue amortizing mortgages decrease if the properties are less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up in the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or changing creditor balances.
This in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset retration.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden sub-prime infection on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and credit contractions push America to recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more severe future.
We've got to keep watching those dorsal wings.
British bankers found guilty in Enron
Three British bankers who were tried for their responsibility in fraud with the former chief of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges by kneeling with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case marks the final fleet of research launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have warned Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation into Enron's fall.
The charge against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former superior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the artifice of a thousand frauds in Enron, who helped his spiral fall into failure.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew that it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the charge, Fastow wrongly represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received nearly 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges at Enron’s collapse.
Three British men were arrested three months later.
Fastow is executing a sentence of 6 years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a 3 year sentence and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers had to pay $1 million for living in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting fraud, could not hide the debt of millions or make it seem successful their failed business.
The collapse resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former executive chief, Jeffrey Schilling, were responsible for their roles in the company's collapse last year.
Schilling is executing a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow.
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"He has capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for family private flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, an orgy of four days of consumption held in a center of events near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new Russians into all kinds of products, from yachts crafted in cowboys to the pearls of incrusted cars of diamonds, worthy of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche in the nearby stand."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and calderella compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplyed with fuel by the oil rise, the Russian capital looked like Dallas when he was in custody.
"We lived the same in 1890 when some audacious Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"As the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and consumers."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part of the pastel.
In another place in Moscow, this week a conference will be held on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the company New York Times)
Russia has 53 billion dollars that make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest.
In addition, the second-degree riches include 103,000 Russian million dollars whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local thanks think.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the level of subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attended the fair for the first time next to the Russian brand's distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon clothes, two agents of the property, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," Yumatova said, who read off the design that he was using as a network mapte veteran dyshing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a store that mixes brands from Cadillac Scales, platinum shorts, Mövenpick ice creams, charge pools, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bears.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand of Dutch real porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in "bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of the most trajectory (10-15 years for the Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the bells logos to the limited edition brands, which would not be exposed in a commercial fair.
However, a number of thousands of people: millionaires in cash, millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the holiday last Thursday, Roman Ersov, Director General of King Koil's Beds, said he sold two spoon systems of $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere, and cotton covered with gold wires.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, salesman for A1 Moto, a company with high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the brilliant orange Porsche for $17,000 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that changes luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car pairs in chain bracelet form, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with incrusted ray of Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a wheel wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants anaesthetic leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of your Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the price fluctuation of real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably already a millionaire, at least in the paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management signature.
The company made four red telephone booths (British style) filled with stacks of false bills of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing officer of the company, said that his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
The visitors stopped shaking money piles, asking their friends to take photos with their mobiles while resting on money piles, or getting a couple of million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgery "capuza" could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw an ambulance climb through White Cape Cod, two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police patrol car appeared.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"It was there when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, a 41-year-old assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Researchers are now trying to determine whether she died because of an unauthorized plastic surgeon procedure, which is not yet identified by the police, but is working at the house of the 212 of Av. West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine the cause of Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test, although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death that lies ahead of the top ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been a helper to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo on Wednesday in a telephone interview.
"She was my guardian."
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the county union prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 P.M.
On 21 November, they found Mrs. Arroyo in a sofa.
She was declared dead in the place.
It has been more than a week and the authorities have said little about their research or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say if Mrs Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as medical advice.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door in Mrs. Castro's house, where a marched rose is located on the front of the house, and a rolling stone on the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillina ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located at the door of the coach, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes pull hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help to get to know the new island city and its political culture.
"She would say, 'You have to watch this one,' she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
You're pregnant."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut the rates to lift the Stock
The actions jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down credit conditions with short interest rates, which increased with the calming comments of the US Central Bank Vice-President.
The stock exchanges took place in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, stated that policy makers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets through growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend remained, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make subsequent cuts of interest, to stabilize credit conditions.
The comments also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the US economy, such as the house sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turmoil were accentuated by a Bear Stearns notice, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total labour force, in a global cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at the close to 13,289.40, while the S&P 500's broad index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index raised 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of Britain's first-order companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
In the past, the reopening of credit tension in the markets after a strong demand for a three-month loan from the European Central Bank, which has considered these loans to European commercial banks to be 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow up on the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the markets of value in London strained the credit and loan rates to three months "Libor" between the British banks, which meant the largest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a constant rise since 12 November.
England takes due account of the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moore, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and moreover because Hugh Morris' desk, director of England, is beginning to fill out offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part of time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth beating place will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as judgements are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it just time for Bombar to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the table: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level for a cricket player, unless they give you the chance to sink or swim next chance?
Figures of course have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time taking a "wicket" and a fighter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly played in the first test even if Stephen Harmison was declared "fit and bowls" as the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each one to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but they both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The Shah or Bombar games at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make the race of a man, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish at the same time who became an important player, and even though he scored a hundred doubles against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today's session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greatest experience on the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable proof of early 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class front only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent backgrounds against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two rounds in May against West Indias in the test in Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed to have taken some of his "battering" elan than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live in swords.
He caught up with nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he threw his vehicle at an exhibition for the English car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, probably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to say with excitement: "Have you seen that?".
Bopara is the best player, it's including your rebalancing pass to have effects on your games that seem to satisfy it, because it fights with confidence and ability.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the true art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea leaves suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday, evicting the exiles who had not been effective, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it's safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious activist Clec Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cease.
Atwani, 38-year-old Chiita and professor in the sunny area of Amariyah, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in her country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped get Al-Qaeda out of his fortress west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the recent arrivals in Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh to northern Baghdad, due to a grenade attack, after urging citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my companions."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since US troops joined groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with US soldiers to defend their neighbours.
But many said they had returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the first Chinese minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death scenes.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting Iraqi visas, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunnit said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunites have been expelled from the Chitese and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring up the sectarian tensions again and the struggle will begin.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international guidance of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only one educational field.
"I explained yesterday for the 15th time to a non-Sarlander who we are not French" - that was the ironic bike on itself from the smallest federal state for his 50th birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in Sarre's educational system, which in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Buildungsmonitor" took the fifth place.
In this way, traditional higher schools have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their university course here with two or three degrees.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bacillus.
"The vocational education system is used in Sarre," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational sector expert at the Institute of German Economy (IW).
More than five young people do their bachelor's degree in the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional and academic education is very broad.
The offer of double careers, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and an increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced higher schools to make more publicity for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start as soon as possible to study the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the student performance has increased.
According to the PISA report of 2003, the number of pupils behind school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But in general, Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
To the disillusionment of the Sardinian people, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although sarcasm is not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory assignment in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changes the time.
Next to Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez let the time in the South American country change by delaying the half-hour clock.
Chávez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Venezuelan State Official Bulletin, under the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a schedule that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justified his decision by saying that the United States would impose the obligation on the world in its day by changing a full time.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the break-up of relations with his neighbor Colombia due to action with hostages.
The left nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or with the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe continued to be the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be extended considerably.
The reason for the conflict was the decision by Uribe to withdraw the mandate of Chávez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of hostages.
On Sunday, Chávez criticized the decision that Uriba made has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is much talk about Chávez.
A new tone of so-called sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by the left populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decrease in real wages threatens Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong situation.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should count in 2007 with a lower real salary than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the strain of food and energy prices," reported the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also correspond to employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent from one year to another was just and reasonable.
Of course, the Labour Office does not have to go back to an unpleasant situation, requesting credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a German social-democratic party politician.
On Tuesday it was announced that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, these are increasing by 3 %.
Venus: Yellow Brother of Earth.
Despite its atmosphere it is not suitable for life, Venus is the most earth-like planet, something that has not yet been raised. The European "Venus Express" probe discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolons in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on the Earth.
For three decades the researchers had suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays call from a height of 54 kilometers of one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific journal Nature.
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, would have given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it's not like this: if there was ever a life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on the Earth and on the surface there are temperatures of 500°C, oscillation so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Possible, Venus is a "diabolic" twin from Earth, but still a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so much like Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there have been no special missions, just for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to researchers, not only underline Venus' uniqueness in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbouring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth than we had imagined," ESA reports.
Despite the already well-known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a vertice formed by the most fast-turned clouds.
This phenomenon recalls the wind currents in the high atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Picconi of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost as large.
This planet is also called a white star or a sunset star orbited around the Sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much like Earth, scientists leave the base that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets there had been plenty of water that remained on the Earth in the oceans, but in Venus it was dissolved in the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones in the Earth, Venus formed most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's half with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor.
He indirectly criticised the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the mid-September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, was concerned about the reputation of Germany and therefore demanded that the large coalition end this fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in the field of foreign policy, underlines the President-in-Office, defending Merkel from the reproach he received in pursuing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take away the traditional course of a Chinese policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his hatred for the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its non-operating foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor resulted in great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese Government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Assuming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of Tibetans in his official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that they are trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances such as those in France will occur.
Fighting with the police on the streets, shooting, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances like in France.
The Federal Minister demands that all possible efforts be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from moving to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot with guns at the police: after serious youth disorders in France, the Federal Minister of Interior, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must make sure that social problems in our country do not take the violent form."
"That's what we have to take seriously," said the paper "New Press," published in Hanover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change in social reality.
The Federal State, the federal state and the municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruit."
It's still early to give the end of the alarm to sit down.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
Young people played a major role in the street with the police in northern Paris last night.
In Tolouse cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action is necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of less than 25 years of age is above the average.
There must be more vocational training.
Kolat underlines: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most of the young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat believes, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
There is a need "to give young people the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training faster".
While the night in the Parisian suburb, Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a light helicopter flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as trash and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1,000 policemen has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Interior, announced that the police would take rigorous measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday about 80 policemen were injured by disturbances in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the following night in Tolouse.
The disorder began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor, the death of young people was not the result of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition with regard to the content has reached its last point and that there is nothing more to be expected of it.
But in what country does Chancellor really live?
After her desperate, indifferent and unencumbered action in the general debate of the Lower House, she must say: she does not live in the country that she would have to be governed by.
With regard to the complaint that he was repeatedly committed to foreign policy actions, Chancellor rejected it with a plausible sentence.
He said that it would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what was in the interest of critics.
In the Lower Chamber, it was made very clear to all that the reproach was appropriate.
It could not be felt with a minimum interest, nor with any kind of feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs into foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything in concrete terms.
One example is the prevention of climate change: it was very much praised for its decisions in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising ourselves - for two years the leader of the Party of the Christian Union has not been able to afford such modesty.
Well, it's used in expressions to give people a boost.
And so it damages its public image by pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal problems appear to be of little value.
Is the poverty of children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
The only thing that is dedicated to talking about this is by using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to talk when it comes to children's supplement.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to make a better sentence.
It began to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, faced a heated debate on the Republican presidential precedents of YouTube and now have to fear only a candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates have been noted from the beginning.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning him into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants".
This, for his part, replied with serious insults: "I mean that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani answers the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as the group of Republicans so far has no clear preference, the eight presidential predecessors take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially in order to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, surrounded by Internet users who were sent to YouTube, have not much content either.
"With this kind of isolation we let Hitler get to power," that was the reproach of John McCain to his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing the troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives a lot of criticism from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", an interrogation method, by letting a person hide himself to simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important issues in the campaign are others, not just war in Iraq or the debate on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised the conservative values and denied the rise of taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney compulsorily and asks for forgiveness for the people and the TV audience for being the advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when he was asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf government has no uniformity.
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn as president.
That's how the eight years of military rule ended in Pakistan.
Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistan's television broadcasts the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his military commander's mandate to his trusted Asfang Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after he was given the power with an incredulous military blow, the former general for the first time ruled the state as a civilian leader.
With his resignation to the Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of exception, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayum, the state's general prosecutor, after the Musharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of exception and meet the second condition of the west.
Since the declaration of an exception in the Supreme Court, there have been many party lawyers in Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all resources before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
In the meantime, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watristan region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman's information, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s continues its activities: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
A copy of "Live 1974" was made as a restern, which was written at the best time in the band.
They were already very famous in foreign countries at the time.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has its own box, its cables and, above all, its buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On your left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the Harmonia band would make music again.
What we have to rebel here is this: the questions accurately have shown that the name of the band resounded in people's minds, but it was not as special as so that after 32 years the audience would be so surprised.
But why can't Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because Krautrock's mistake has always been more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to the Can 2003 Colonia band members for their work of life, the room could see the amazing faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouth with surprise.
Later, Michael Rother spent time on the stage during the concerts of Red Hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (from the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this side, because the trio only existed two years and in those times I did not achieve a great effect in the public, however, it was subsequently achieved thanks to the others.
A long time ago Moebius and Roedelius had performed music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf who was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a work at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the New Band! He got to improve the reputation of this German band that was too radical at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees in the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, they say, there was a band of Ottenstein's Harmonia Song Association in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Music von Harmony" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to get to know himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griesem. Someone remembers that, in this recording, almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do it from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on issues of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flamende Herzen".
Cluster survived the 1980s and has had more success since then than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
Your Greenland music company was set as a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the New Band! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized by public measures at the Wordtronics Festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all Krautrock's influences to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a superband, a place that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmony appears with producers in a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where instruments are seen with cables.
There are three veterans in the background who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce an extraordinary tone with the help of the effects that they had built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is just like it was supposed to be.
Three people who deepen in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment he coughs, sneezes, and at a good time of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never rock.
Gender was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in flight from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here calls "68!" is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
The stage is very well thought out about what is already obvious.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
It can break one's nerves or give you quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the Balkan mountain, but right there, in the dark of the country during the war in Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally, we had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant roles and little importance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to perhaps see the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do the titles of the films have to be so long and shot today?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the bottom, its role as a reporter in war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life had already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decade had so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, it turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films on the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerdescher Frieden" can be described in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb of Kosovo's snipers, one of them acting very quickly and that also leads you to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once more as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
The example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because there was never really a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another script author (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about the American war reporters who are going to detect a war criminal Serb called "Zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and always results in a mad journey.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they present us to Simon Hunt, to whom they do not just let him be a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieved what they could not achieve for five years by NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters, who were captured by the war criminal and left the Bosnian Muslims to avenge themselves in a just way.
It is so bad that they are willing to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply humane one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadzić and Mladić are still free, and it points out that Americans and French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head with a very famous Brecht poem.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great hurdles of his face I see, sharing the feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons, but they show that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only the type of war movies in the Balkans.
A short time ago in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fake.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star falls through a region of crisis or the fields of mines, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "bloody diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Probably all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to go through at least decades until Hollywood drives a good movie on the burnt by having, for example, the movie "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. Classics like the works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today, we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time each murder (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because script authors don't have the least repair (which is needed for power) in telling good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great dictator" turned out to be so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know it was really so bad the Nazi regime.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to film a movie.
Maybe it should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When asked about parallelisms between his historical novel "Lemprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "It is only because some things never change."
The great cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally murdered and war in Yugoslavia will always reign.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympic Games in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and the economy for not requesting the Summer Olympic Games.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, expressed this resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times, no other project in the great city has encouraged as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political momentum, sportable at the same level could not be maintained."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statement that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympic Games would not be carried out until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but decides on it by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust in the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's application for the Winter Olympic Games of 2028.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which we had so far thought to have up to 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will have no opportunity."
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years, Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too soon to leave the opportunity, if the plans are now ruined," said Wednesday Günter Plöß, the director of HSB.
A waiver of the application is contrary to the statement made by the senate chief at a reception on the basis of the general meeting of the German Public Sport Federation of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust appointed Hamburg's application for Universities of 2015 not as "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Last week alone, the Sports Federation of Higher Schools named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) accused the Senate of not taking so much time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small town of Grassbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carlo Veit and Jan Quast, German Social Democratic Party (SPD) MPs.
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grassbrook and then the use of the houses built, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games provoked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the list of works of Warhol.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box's "type" on this list are false.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol in 1968, the Modern Museum of Stockholm carried out internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén Museum gave to the Modern Museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of the "type Stockholm", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
The prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the red, blue and white wooden boxes, with the same sample that had "Brillo" soap dust cartons.
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Modern Museum, hundreds of cardboard-boxes were exposed. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
It was not art works, but copies (which were only a few objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden some wooden-boxes, but they were not exposed at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered into the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of the Stockholm type authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were bought in auctions for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum, false statements were made that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö to Hultén and for the exhibition in San Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already been dead for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Modern Museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and embellished their printed plates and then painted them to the oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a round without printing directly the printed plates. Furthermore, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, director of the Modern Museum and adds that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Modern Museum museum will classify these six boxes as copies/objects of exhibition."
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it would accept these "serious accusations" as regards soap powder boxes.
But since then, everything has remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had been harassed in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The head of Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Faithful soldiers to the government had attacked the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been attraction for hours in the building.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had the trial Thursday for trying a coup of state in 2003 that ended with a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that he could deposit himself with about 30 sympathizers as soon as possible.
The military policemen who should have watched him had evidently passed on to their ranks and followed their motto.
They entered the hotel "Península" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government's troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Council, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are tired," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to move on to our rows."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the Scout Reangers elite, said that within a short time the other military forces wanted to follow the march.
The major government critics called Thursday for a great protest against the president.
For months, his government has been blamed for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention to the motive that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven coups of state against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday the company informed that the average price for an action was EUR 14,46.
It has only 20.05 per cent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also options to increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital Subscribe Line).
On Wednesday they already made suggestions on entry into business, after Brendenberg increased its participation in the Dusseldorf network operator by 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution retains the shares for a third party.
United Internet already participated with almost 10 percent of the Drillisch telecommunications company on the previous day.
Drillisch placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million in the capital increase measure.
The United Internet has purchased from them 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, companies started negotiations on DSL product marketing cooperation.
"Let's strengthen our collaboration," United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent participation in Freenet and do not use their right, i.e. they make 18.49 percent participation in Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the German Telecom market consolidation.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far, United Internet and Drillisch's holding was directly 6.01 percent of Freenet's participation.
They had then agreed that Drillisch would achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment society was already agreed in August.
