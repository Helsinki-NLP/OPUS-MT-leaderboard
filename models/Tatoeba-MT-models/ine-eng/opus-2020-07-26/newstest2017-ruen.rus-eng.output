Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
The International Group of Biologists has concluded that the world's longest-lived vertebrate is Greenland's polar shark, which may live for some 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists have conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the crystalline of the eyes of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark with a length of more than five metres may be between 272 and 512 years.
Biologists believe that the long-term role of the shark is a low metabolism that leads to slow development.
The female Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity for only 150 years.
Previously, it was thought that most of the bellfish live in the "neighbor" of the shark, the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known as the scientist was over 210 years old.

Should I go to a sanatorium if there's no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor in the sanatorium of Olga Bogus.
And if a healthy person just gets tired of work, does he have to go to the sanatorium?
We need health care not only for the treatment but also for the prevention of diseases.
Under the condition of a person's sanatorium, he can check the condition of his or her body and receive advice from a doctor on how to live so that his or her health is not damaged.
Such recommendations will not be too much for anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it doesn't have to be removed.
Constant stress, mental and physical depression can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90% coming.
He has the highest number of people in large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's best not to make it difficult and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people have reduced their biological age during their period of stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the entire family.
So if you want to leave with your children, you won't have to leave with them.
For children, even the youngest, health programmes include both diagnostic services, paediatric consultation, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's swimming pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, treatment culture.
The course of procedures shall be determined by a doctor taking into account the individual evidence and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, in sanatoriums, a children's club usually works with animators, where children can attend play lessons, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with young people, provide the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced nurse.
The soft winter, long summer, the rainy days of the year (over 300) create good conditions for a vacation in the Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body needs more than just a summer break.
So there is no fear of window weather, more than most procedures are carried out in the room and are not dependent on the season.
In general, health care is desirable for 2 times a year, especially for adults.
The main fisque of the Caucasian Mineral Water region is, of course, the treatment of mineral sources: Slavyanovski, Smirnovski, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different systems of the body.
The water varies according to temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks water depending on the patient's feelings.
So, Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory action, restores the function of the yeast tract and the exchange of substances.
"Esentuki-4" has an effect on the liver and kidney tract, lowers the sugar level.
The "new" is anti-inflammatory, bitter and wet.
The same effects include Slavian water.
When appointing water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the heart-suspension system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it selects less salt water because the salts hold the fluid to increase the pressure.
Acceptance of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, at the required quantity and at a specific temperature.
There are now various cosmetic procedures available for persons and bodies in the sanatorium.
What types of healing based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus can be found in the resorts of the region?
Near Pietgorska, for example, is the salty lake of Tambukan, adding a piece of which is useful for systems, bells, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating effect.
These are health walks on individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort (second in size in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located close to the mineral source of Narzan.
The baths can also be taken with wine, creamy, iodine-bromous, rural, sulfane-lacritic, depending on what your doctor will appoint.
We're continuing the fertility.
What do you do to make the harvest go by the end of the season?
As told by Julia Belopuchov, an agronomist and a daughter.
The high-level atoms are time to set the line: to remove new pastures, to cut flies, to remove all leaves until the last box with fruits and flowers with small bundles - they cannot be harvested.
All tomatoes, regardless of the “constitution”, as well as prunes and beaks, are supported by a zole-superphosphate extract, processed by biopharmaceuticals (the maintainer - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruits, phytosporin-M, phytolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from diseases, immunocytophyte - to improve immunity, Bitoxybacillus, Lepidocid, Fitoverm - if there are harmful).
Chemicals at the end of the summer should only be used for copper copper, colloidal sulphur and green soap.
We're doing the last crop.
The long-sleeved bulbs in the heat so that the lower, general part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, drains the water and solution of the Circone, and soaks the 5-7 cm of the compound.
It is also difficult to extend the fruition of the cabota: cut the old leaves, pour hot water and solution of the complex well, put the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect from night colds, place over a chain of hoses with a covert material.
Keep the plants open on the day of the plant, and close the sun after sunset.
The marks of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia's withdrawal from the longest in the last 20 years.
According to Bloomberg's analysts, GDP shows a positive trend, with GDP falling by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of the year.
This indicator has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Russia, the Russian economy has slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The stabilization of the situation has also been reported recently by the Central Bank and the Minéconomocratic Developments.
It's going to be a slow growth.
In the opinion of the CBD experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"The Russian GDP index estimates that the recession is behind and ahead is a slow growth in the economy," says the Russian Bank's paper "What trends are talking about."
The module assessment of GDP in the current quarter of the regulator has increased to 0.4 per cent, and the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
As the representative of Minéconomourity reported, the fall in GDP in the second quarter of the year was 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared drop in GDP accounted for 0.2 per cent of the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline was stopped: in April it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June the change in GDP was between 0-0.15", quoted the representative of the MER RIA "Newste".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that the "down" has been achieved.
Among other markers indicating a recovery of the national economy, Bloomberg calls for an increase in demand for electricity and rail transport, a recovery of the business.
If an amendment to the year is high, it is clear that the energy consumption of more than 1% may be partly due to an additional working day.
Add to this lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and plus 0.5 per cent of the half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Jakovenko from ALOOR BROKER.
On the other hand, there are other, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, in the last two weeks, Rosstat has fixed the deflation.
Russia's prices dropped for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the rudder course, which, although showing strong fluctuations in the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of August.
It is also one of the signs of recovery for which indicators from the real sector of the economy must be drawn," says Jakovenko.
In addition, since April, the RF has seen an increase in industrial output.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7 per cent.
The decline in external trade is slowed from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics also demonstrate the labour market situation, with unemployment declining to 5.4%.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the favourable situation in the labour market, the issue of real incomes available to the population should be left to wish for the best.
The annual expression decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This factor can slow the recovery of the economy, as household costs contribute little to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the economy is more than 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the strong policy of the Bank of Russia can also be called risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not best affected by the real sector.
A negative factor is and is not sufficiently high in investment, which inhibits industrial capacity development.
In general, however, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the fall rate of the RF economy will be slowed to -0.5 per cent versus -3.7 per cent in 2015," said GK Analyst Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The naturalization process of sportsmen recently launched in Russian football and experienced in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi until they develop so actively in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and former foreigners are, in most cases, the natives of the former Republic of the Soviet Union.
Therefore, in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a sufficient number of Russians are under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship varies.
Someone's parents have been taken to another country yet in childhood without leaving a choice.
Someone has failed to compete for a place in the Russian assembly.
And someone felt that the best conditions for development in sport would be established abroad.
Aif.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
A 27-year-old girl's passport says her name is Lisa Rijih.
But she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Only four years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, Lisa's parents decided to migrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go down the steps of her older sister to pursue a light athletic career.
Just like her sister, Lisa picked the six-bedties.
Stay here in Russia, if you could hardly move Elena Isinbaev from the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Liz will be the only one in the six-bedroom sector.
Its best achievements in this form are the 2010 award of the European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaev.
The 29-year-old Elena Pirozkova was born in Novokusneck in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
Besides Elena, there were eight more children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started to fight at school.
With good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where the U.S. Training Centre continued to attend under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboijnik.
At the 2012 Olympics, Elena lost her first grasp in London.
That's why the World Championships in the same year are winning.
Previously, she was able to win the gold at the 2010 World Cup.
After that, there were bronzes in 2013 and in September 2014.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in Jaroslavla, where she first met a synchronous swim.
But to say that our coaches in Russia have raised her would be wrong.
Soon the girls ’ family decided to move to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her activities.
Soon she was already in the U.S. assembly and showed wonderful results in the Pan-American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists can not compete, but for America, its targets are a threshold.
The new name, which sounds more strange in Russian, was received by Kristina Chaldibina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue training the girl in the arts gymnastics after the ocean.
So far, the girl has been engaged in a favorite sport in the home of Yaroslav.
When she emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth assembly in that country and later broke into the main national team.
At the American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first place on the world stage, she certainly did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized the current breakthrough, bringing out a star-star collection at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Another one of our ex-girlfriends is Jan Beresko-Margrander, who is in favour of the German assembly.
She was born in Toledo.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more opportunities to become a national assembly.
Soon she had represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, it is true, Jana was able to occupy only 17 seats that were not enough to fall into the final competitions in the personal front.
So two years earlier, she was able to win the bronze medal for the Olympic Games.
Another gymnast, only this time sport is Irina Sasonova.
If the migration routes mentioned above can be referred to as standard, the choice of the Irish family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is an educator at the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she was the champion of the country.
True, Ira is trained in Russia, however, especially coming to the family so that she does not lose her skills.
She was not as successful as she would have liked to be in Rio.
The best place is 40 in the private pool.
There is very little information on Mary Ugolkov ' s fleet in Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria lives and is trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had been under the Russian flag, showing poor results - even the country's record was 200 metres away by batterflies.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and became a member of the Red and White Flag.
In Rio its best speech is 14 places in the 4x100 complex.
In order to get into the game, the girl launched a stealthfanding project that enabled her to collect some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, spent almost all of his career under the Russian flag.
At that time, Hasavourta's grandson was able to become a three-time champion of European champions, a Russian champion, an international sports master.
When he stopped attending our national assembly, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter has disappeared from sports grounds.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batirov has already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and took a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-rossian, Michael Kudinov, is more familiar with the family than even with the Swiss sailor Maria Ugolkov.
The thing is, his parents were emigrating from the Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was quite young.
That's where Michael started doing sports gymnastics.
It had not achieved greater success at the international level.
In Rio, his best score was 40 seats on parallel bridges.
But for New Zealand, even falling into the Olympics in sports gymnastics has already been broken.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her activities in synchronizing, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, a girl took 6th place in a synchronous navigation at the European Championship in Berlin.
In the duet with Evgenie Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
In the salt program, she was the fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croiter is a member of Israel.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitria was the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the youth world championship.
A year later, Croiter also won the gold of the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to the high pins, Dmitri has a long and triple pins.
31-year-old Albert is another Hasaviurt native who, after long speeches to Russia, decided to change his sports nationality.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he attended the Krasnoyarsk High School of Sports, even becoming the country's champion in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the Soviet Union volleyball game Yaroslav Antonov.
For a year before the birth of Jaroslav, he was recognized as the best volleyballist on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for a long time.
In 2015, he became the bronze champion of the European Championship, held in the territory of his new family.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994, and he joined his family in the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was an original goal, but it did not succeed in this northern country - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won the championship of peace among young people and later qualified to participate in the Olympics.
In Rio he will be the only representative of France in the fighting tournament.
It's a free fight again, and it's a former Russian again.
This time it will be about the birth of the Northern Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, about Timor-Leste.
He was granted Spanish citizenship at the end of December 2012, and is currently serving as a team leader in that country.
Before that, it was true that 30-year-old sportsmen had been able to score high scores in Russia as well.
He became the bronze champion of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
The Charter of Incompatibilities in assembly, Timeuras decided to change sports citizenship.
The latest on our list is a Czech boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahachal, Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family to Canada through Azerbaijan.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been a Canadian champion three times, and in 2012 he has become a world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the Pan-American gold, the first for his new family since 1975.

Why do children have class speakers in schools?
According to Governor V. Condratiev, "it is necessary to raise not by actions or by parades, but by system."
They must grow and at least seven years of age understand that they must be speakers and education.
But as long as this work seems to me to be done formally and I suspect it's more on paper.
If the speakers of the class get all the positive things they've done before, at a quality new level, I'll be happy.
If everything's drunk and unknown, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The GCC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors in the country's economy.
The funds allocated to the common area from budgets at different levels are allocated.
According to the Gender Procurator ' s Office, tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of GCH.

According to the investigation, as the head of the city facility repair fund, Makarov concluded agreements with entrepreneurs, the work on it was not actually done, but was paid.
Businessmen just gave him a lot of money back.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected the money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their needs.

It's quite difficult to judge in the field of CWC.
Things aren't going to work, they're going to take a long time.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation - Svetlana Developmentneva, executive director of NP "ZKH Control".
We do not have a single law, as we are making a new one, which must force the previous one to work.
Specialists, including judges, are also few on the issue of CWC.
The lawyers themselves recognize that the right to housing in knots is very low.
Refusals in criminal proceedings are also discussed by the Office of the Attorney General in the course of investigations.
Of the 3.5 thousand crimes committed in 2015, less than half are committed.
In the remainder of the investigation, it was prolonged and each fifth was suspended due to the non-establishment of the accused.
There are often shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement authorities in the existing legislation.
There is a law, but the intelligence authorities are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.

In the five months of the current year, their number has increased only slightly - 99.
What is the counterfeiting of the protocol of the housing collection?
This means that the change in home management, financial and other issues are about the opinion of the owners.
And that also means that the housing and municipal services market cannot be run by normal companies who want to work honestly, not "donate" the population.
It turns out that the residents in the minus, the small and the medium business, too.
First of all, through the elimination of corruption as a whole, it is certain that Anton Zarkov, a member of the Committee on Property Affairs.
And now this work is actively being done.
It's not just a single action, it's a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, this is not the sad situation in all regions.
In particular, there are scandals in the capital, and they don't smell.
Why is there no such scandals in Moscow in the area of GKH, as in many other regions?
For example, because the capital government has shown its will and order, the "Aif" told Anatoly Electoral, a member of the Committee of the House on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the staff issue and legislative amendments and legal education.
The management companies have been closely monitored, and all of them have been licensed.
Citizens' complaints are quickly resolved in public space (and the treatment of residents and response measures are posted on the Government of Moscow portal).
Many do not simply pay monthly receipts, but they carefully observe what is written there as the house is.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
In addition, Moscow examines the eligibility of housing and community services tariffs, because a large portion of the budget is in favour of grants and benefits for many categories of population.
It's probably all together to explain the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Is it up to the regional authorities?
Maybe it's free to change the place of work?
Turkey's Hambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued the U.S. ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethholha Gulen, an Islamic preacher charged with the organization of a coup d'état.
He said this in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up support to the "Terrorist Fetholachist Organization".
This is not Turkey's first statement, in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the gap between Turkey and the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt to change the country.
Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO ("Terrorist Fetholachist Organization").
Or organizing the conversions of the FETO or the democratic Turkey.
It should make this choice," quoted the Anatolian Agency for the Treatment of Erdogogan, which was held in Ankara on Wednesday evening.
The President of Turkey, on the other hand, had demanded more than ever from the United States to comply with his requirement, which he had been called for for the first time after the siege.
Let us recall that on the night of 16 July Turkey's high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army were attempting to force the legitimate authority in the country, as well as the attempt to live by the head of the State.
However, after Recep Erdogan addressed the population, the dispute was suppressed and its organizers and participants were arrested.
A total of about 8,000 people were suspected of being teachers and scientists, in which, in addition to the military, there were thousands of teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their teacher was Fetholah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Erdogogan's supporters also admitted that Americans can be involved in the highway.
All claims in their address were rejected, refusing to issue Guilen and advised to modify the tone.
The last statement made by the representatives of Mr. Herdegagan was made last Tuesday at the time of his visit to St. Petersburg.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey, which insists on it and also imposes demands on other Western partners.
"The Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the Euro Union if Brussels does not call the date of the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," EU Minister Omer Chelk said on 9 August.
He said that the amendment to the anti-terrorism law by Ankara, as required by the EU, would endanger Europe's own security.
It should be noted that on 1 August, German Vice-Chairman Zigmar Gabriel requested Turkey to end the EU's commitment to open borders for migrants to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to the relevant statement made by the head of the media of Turkey, Mevluta Chavuschoglu.
Another provocative statement made by Chavuschoglu last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to leave NATO.
The head of Turkish media did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not meet its expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the field of defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries working with foreign defence States - they import missiles," Chavuschoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology and to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has been trying to cooperate with NATO member countries so far, but the results have not met us, and we have been looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that all of this refers to Turkey's serious disagreements with the West and the country's Eastern orientation.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertization of Eugenie Minchenko believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a severe confrontation with the West.
He is very much involved in both the West and business, and in terms of the military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance with the West by maintaining a framework for relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be easier for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this position," explained the AIF.ru expert.
According to him, it was not excluded that after the Turkish leader's statements (on the non-payment of compensation from the EU, the requirement for visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Guilen from the United States) would be applied to him.
"Rejep Erdogan is faced with the deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press on to it on humanitarian issues, the dictatorial methods of managing the country and so on," says Minchenko.
The Head of the Centre for Political Information, Alexei Muhin, admitted that the President of Turkey would change his view of relations with Russia as soon as he found it beneficial.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very harsh position with Russia and sought favor in every way in the West.
For a very short time, the situation had changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again for a while.
I think Erdogan entered the period of primary diplomacy.
If he is between the two Poles - West and Russia - he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Muhin thinks.
He believed that the main task for the President of Turkey today was to maintain political power in the country, and that he needed Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting the United States.
Turkey needs the EU and the United States, which, through it, control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Consensus will therefore be reached with Turkey," the expert considers.
In other words, the head of the Asia Centre and the Middle East is Anna Glazza.
Now Turkey's relations with the EU and the United States are sufficiently tense, and this is primarily related to the internal policy that Erdogan himself is pursuing.
I think that this crisis will be intensified in relations, and in the light of the crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to recharge both the Middle East and Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, said that they were willing to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, resolved relations with Israel, had an active political interaction with Iran," explained Aif.ru Glazaz, which would allow the next step in the normalization of relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing was the return to the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the "no problems with its neighbours".
The President of Turkey's visit to Russia and Africa has now been very successful.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's positions both in the regional and international arena," the expert said.
The vote believes that Turkey's return to former relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, and now the question is whether the EU will be responding strictly to Turkey, which can go to the opening of borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Young Doctors Fight: Calls for New Collective Protests
Young doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of the Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) intends to request its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said that ministers could not answer questions about the employment contract.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members published on Twitter Thursday evening, President JDC Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued to "keep silent" about the problems that she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, "In view of the current situation, the JDC leader voted against the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your issues."
In response to the silence of the Government, the leader of JDC today made an official request to the extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme for the expansion of collective protests from early September.
The campaign led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first universal strikes in the history of the Public Health Service.
The leader of BMA's younger doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to abolish the agreed working conditions recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to be accepted during the meetings before the vote of 54 000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance Bad?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the gold court hall in St. Petersburg, I had a lasting impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handcuff, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked tense, and he barely made it warm even by his own standards.
Regzep Tayip Erdogan, contrary to this, spoke repeatedly of his "other dear" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level but even above.
On the next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite.
But the prolonged cold coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: Turkey had taken a Russian fugitive on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was unstoppable.
Mr. Putin got angry with the angry tyrada, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
Grief was even stronger on the basis of the alleged friend.
The restoration of real trust would be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the media-controlled State conducted a shocking, total attack on Ankara.
It turned out suddenly that Turks should be held guilty at all.
The most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogogan's own family was engaged in illegal oil trade in the Syrian zone controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He firmly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg, an official signal came, and it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin had received the apology he requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim to win its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of the proclamation of peace are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he's almost out of his post last month while trying to convert.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have obviously shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit heavily — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen sharply by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, feel relief when flights are finally renewed.
They put on the peak end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public television predicted more cheap fruits and vegetables than Turkish imports of agricultural products would be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," said the newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil in the West because it thinks it's a weak response to a conversion attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the crumbling pace of the EU accession talks and Mr Putin's move, which is trying to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonus rounds with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after the attempt to convert the State.
Consider this data for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of changing the regime.
So, the summit in this shining palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine that one analyst described me as a "bad alliance": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
Nevertheless, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two remain at a considerable disadvantage.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
He may have said for himself that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, until two presidents gave a press conference, they had not even touched on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster when a member of NATO has taken over a Russian reaction trigger, it is better that at least two leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS should be considered as a back office, according to the Bank's Executive Director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank withdrew from them since he was almost eight years old and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorial assistance to international sport, from Cuba to the Wymbledon andy Murrea champion.
But it has now been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come out first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking services that will have more impact -- Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan interviewed clients and staff during a tour of Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brend RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more brand-banking."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we have no more global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship support to Cuba of six nations, and it increases the profile of various brands in sponsoring sport.
"This is the right time for us to move the brand bank, because on the basis of (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and close all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return those brands again, so I think it's time.
Franki Dettori is among 3,000 winners winning the New Market in the Presbyterians
The detectives sprayed champagne after the double in Newmarket brought it to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Detective won his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding note by means of his second winner at night on his home road, at the Prestratia, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey, which has reached this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
It is due to Sir Gordon Richards, Long Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Idder and Willy Carson.
A three-time detective jockey champion who once won the Ghayyar said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here, too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket, because it was here that I moved 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from cases and I'm very hostile.
Children accept applause when they give a predisposition after victory
Two jockeys achieved such a mark in the jumps with obstacles: Richard Johnson's jockey champion and retired 20-time champ Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4300 for a record career.
Lester Piggott, the ninth winner of Derby, 4493 wins in career
Franky is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached.
He's stylish and strong, but that's his tactical smack that distinguishes him from others in the brass room.
He was a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Franky a few weeks ago in Epse, he'd have brought 6,000 winners if it wasn't just a jockey of out-and-out jumps!
And if you're serious, Franky has brought the winners to Britain for over 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character that's good for British jumpers, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Franki Dettori distinguished this outstanding mark with a firm's hard-earned horse
From the speedy finish to the speedy jumps, Frankie Dettoire is a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
It's been taken and dropped.
A number of large jumpers, including its famous "Velicolep seven" in Ascote in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and a trial for doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous strength of will to challenge skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for a while. Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in the competitions, at least by the age of 50.
Putin relieves the head of the administration of Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of a trusted neighboring town of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was now appointed as a representative of the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “set Ivanov free from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration”, but did not mention the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Wayne, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Wayne, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the President's protocol and the Government's apparatus, reports the Kremlin website (Russian).
At the time of the appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of State with regard to the development of draft laws and the monitoring of how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivan had asked him to be released from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vienna.
Are the smiles convincing?
It's the move that made Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin for a long time and, like him, has served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on public television, both men stated that the head of the administration had resigned on his own request.
But despite the smiles on the camera, few people have been convinced here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the unforeseen consequences of any power struggle?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement is that a person who was once aggrieved as a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy was confronted with enormous skepticism.
In Putin's comments on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "This is the truth that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me with this very difficult position, even a four-year problem position.
Well, I've been the head of the president's administration for four and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the Public Security Service of the KGB, as was Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed its deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At one time Ivanov was considered to be the President of Russia after Putin's second term, since Putin's third term would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, this position was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.
The star of the "Think as a criminal" series, Thomas Gibson, fired after a trade deal with the producer.
Gibson was involved in the show's landings in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, have announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in the land and differences in opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how the Gibson character will be removed from the show, which is monitored by the FBI team of agents, is expected to follow later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who had previously played a leading role in the Darma and Greg network, was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "I think as a criminal" and I have put my heart and soul in it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there before the end, but now it's not gonna be possible.
I would just like to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our outstanding team, and, above all, the best worshipers the show could ever dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Mystery: Fish landed in Banfa Garden
A man from Banfa sought help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Baine believes 75 fish could be sands left with water dead.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a collection of this oblivion in Periscope in hopes that someone would be able to shed light on the appearance of two-dimensional fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The $1.35 billion project is now to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have joined the North Spring and the Wiaduk Queensferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.
This is the first of four leaks between the "fires of canvas" that are now approaching the completion of all three pilots of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fief is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contained 10,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is now to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Kit Brown visited the square today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering of a truly epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the mixing between the faucet and the bridge is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate assembly permits.
A total of about 79 per cent of the total bridge deck now on the ground, for the last section of the deck, the concrete cover is flown into the Rosite today, which means that the whole deck is ready to climb to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Director Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first swing on each bridge project is always a significant wave.
In this amazing project, this trick is the most modern construction art.
After the last section of the roadboat was set up and connected with the expanding North Pillar Roadboat, we were then left to close the remaining barrier on the north — or the shoreline.
This was done by raising the northern approach to 700 millimetres south.
It was a large and at the same time a very remarkable operation.
It is large, because the van length 222 meters, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be raised at an angle of about 3 per cent.
It is understandable because the permits that the team had worked on were fragile — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Salvation in Moelfr Bay: Three men 's lucky to stay alive'
Three men were "lucked to stay alive" after they were released from the fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was alarmed at 13:20 in British summer time on Friday, after the team saw the event taking place in Moelfr Bay.
Three men were all trying to reach a safe place, while their ship was still on its way.
"We saw their ship circling around with them and assumed the worst," said Moelfri Vince Jones.
"Happyly, by the time we went down to the water, a strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were saved by a local fishing vessel, and a third man was found for 60 years disabled and stuck in a boulevard without a lifeboat.
All of them had been boarded by the shore rescue squad and delivered to the rescue station.
Jones said, "The three men who have been thrown into the water have been lucky that they are alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had an accident trigger, but it somehow got rid of the man who was running the boat when she woke up.
Someone saved these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go to the street to play, preferring to spend their free time watching on the screen, has been a complaint to many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go poisons people from the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited by television, then by video and recently by smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the slow involvement of Pokémon Go, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (after a series of films, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural events, all of this has been lost just before this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries was then delayed due to a massive response by the server overloaded.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder had and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players are going to look for Pokemons that are tracking the GPS and, being found, can be 'photographed' (through the box on your phone) or 'records'.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined a slow catch, ridding themselves of the giants to search for it.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of “normal” steps per day.
The Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people tracked by 30-minute exercises per day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing in Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary level transition data.
Many health campaigns that convince people "to find 30 minutes", "to get up from the couch" and "to be active every day", have found no response because most health messages are boring and people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to adjust weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she pushes people on the street to do what they love.
Thus, there are three health bases: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt.
Usually, there are pregnant women who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone can knock on the door.
So what?
The break-in happened.
Although applications for smartphones, such as Fitbit, were able to track our physical activity before, they did not give us a chance to practice, as this game does.
The news is coming, and the use will slow down in time.
However, because of Pokemon's success, more games will be available that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to want to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Bails wins the gold of an absolute championship in women's gymnasium
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the sum.
Simon Bails is invincible for all of this.
It's dynamic on the stand.
Not forced on the thighs.
Breathing in the field.
That's amazing.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went up to the title of an absolute championship on Thursday, placing the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration at the attention of the Olympics.
Its general ball 62,198 was sufficiently removed from the silver medalist and a companion of the final Peterka team, Eli Reisman, and the Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafin.
Bails from the United States is on the gymnasium bridge during the finals of a women ' s individual solo championship on art gymnastics in 2016 of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bails became the fourth-ranking American woman who won the title of the championship of an absolute championship and the fifth at all, confirming her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps at any time.
She was upset when they showed her final general ball and her long journey to this point ended.
This achievement puts her in the same league as very rare athletes, such as Michael Felps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Bails has spent the last three years mastering his sport by winning 15 medals at the World Cup, including 10 gold - with such stunning programs in their combination of passion and precision that the 1984 Olympic Championship Mary Lou Retton called it "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen".
One final test was expected in Brazil, not as much competition as between Bails and the others in this field as between her and the burden of expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with the worst gold medals, would be viewed as an unjustified expectation.
Simona Bails from the United States, on the left, and Eli Reisman, are held after winning gold and silver, respectively, at the finals of the women's individual absolute championship in the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bails earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final deal for a farewell party in the resignation of the coordinator of the National Assembly Marta Caroli.
While Bailey insisted that she never looked forward to the future during her long journey to the top, that was not the case.
Part of her free exercise program — which includes her business tour — is set up in Latin American music, which would come directly from home on the street right outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was widowed by her grandfather and grandmother, starting to walk as a child and the mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not been playing any competition for the absolute championship since summer 2013 — the transport sector that should continue as long as Bailey wants.
Although Mustafin had received a small benefit through two treatments, it was peace.
Gymnastic and free exercises — where Bailey protects the name of the world champion — are grounded.
She went out again from 15,433 in February and ended from 15,933 in the field.
Raisman gently wrapped her up as they waited for the final account — pure formality — and the tears appeared around the shining red with white and blue bees when the idea that she had ever written in the cut album came about.
Reysman's speech was a small place four years ago when she shared a third place, but lost Mustafin's bronze in Thai.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which Americans call a "baby" was a lot ahead.
She sent a kiss to a crowd after her free exercise, covered by a return, which was sometimes the subject.
With regard to Bails, the virus tweet 19 years from the beginning of this week is now quite new:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack on the first Finnish serial killer in the last decade, sat in the car, talked and listened to the music when they were shot, according to the police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefani R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the road, the authorities said.
The offender made about eight shots of the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, then hiding on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claim that the triple murder is not apparently the result of a robbery, since the perpetrator has not taken a wallet or $2,900 in possession of an adult victim.
The Finnish police representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting had prompted investigators to check whether he had been involved with the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were wounded as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"This is happening in the residential area outside the house," said Howard KHO, the CBS branch, early this month.
The suspect was believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan end of the 1990s, the black BMW end of the 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked to each other and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and ended later.
Liner, 31 years old, and Alice's daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The Witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup half an hour before the triple murder, which they believe was the case of a serial killer.
The investigators found the bricks and pulled the rifle out of the seat and the parts of the rifle out of the motor section.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephalus: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixiveto loves singing, playing games, and, of course, his mom.
However, unlike most of their peers, Edmund microcephalus is the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I could not do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign it.
What really isn't true is, of course, you sign on to it," she said.
Her and her husband told Vincent that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that," Pixivto explained.
Edmund's walking through the halls.
Edmund didn't sit down and use until he was three, and he hasn't spoken yet.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He's walking side by side and riding on a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth is showing the gesture that Edmund was thinking of "please contact me."
"We're learning his sign language," said Picsivto CBS News.
But not just the usual language of gestures — she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly may occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetics, such as Edmunda, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as corn and zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how it's going to affect the lives of those infected with Zika's virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I've been telling you what's going to happen all along?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has a encouraging advice for mothers with serious defects because of Zik.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flood is the cause of rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected to fall over the state by Saturday, including.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and South Mississippi have emerged from the shores and are threatened with widespread flooding after an extreme number of rainfalls, the National Meteorological Service reported.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards said that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already gone to the affected incomes.
Mike Styl, a representative of the Governor ' s Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that high-water, boat and sandbag transport requests were being made.
Styl said that only Tangipaho's income had asked for tens of thousands of bags with sand.
The danger of flooding remains in force until Saturday on most of the southern part of Louisiana.
The Weather Service stated in a statement that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall into the area.
In southern Alabama, the weather service was operating until Friday, as the rain continued to flow to the Mobila area.
The Comit River near Baton-Ruze and the Emit River near Den Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to establish a record of the flood level in the past exits.
Synoptic Alex Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban areas near Baton-Russia.
He also said that the flooding coming down at Assensen's arrival was a threat, as these rivers would slowly reach the Morp Lake.
The Tikfo River, heard from the southern border of Mississippi, Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded levels at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pushing people from the floods in the districts of Emit and Wilkinson to the south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepfather were among those who were saved early Friday next to Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Bever Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet away from his home, were quickly up at night.
He said that another animal who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept going," said Hansford.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest flood she'd seen in 48 years of living here.
Hansford said he and all his family were disabled, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three with the help of an army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloster, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood was “quickly spreading”, as the rains continued, noting that officials were considering the evacuation order.
Krautmann says that a observer near Livingstone reported a fall of 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday.
Croutmann said that the soil had been recharged by rain from the environment.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets have led to the rescue of residents from the homes of Tangipahoa and the abolition of five school districts, states the authorities.
WWL, the CBS branch, reports that the Tangjipahoa adviser told about 200 warm houses.
The residents were evacuated in two churches, but both of them are now warming up.
The President of the arrival of Robbie Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals in high water.
Privats were opened in the city of Emit and the city of Hammond to accept those who were evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to drop," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the arrival of Tanjipahoa about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels, and sandbags were available to be delivered to the residents in hopes that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said urban manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the Head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the rainy rains continued to flow off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as heated on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the store manager of Shopper Value Foods in Emit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tausson, "and she's still on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "pulled by bullets", remains alive after the shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shot at 6-year-old in the city this week.
His grandmother and granddaughter introduced him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown received multiple gunshot wounds, including his breath, leg, hand and life, but was aware of when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot, his little body was cut off by bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melandez.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is counted in the hospital in critical condition and has survived several operations.
The family told the station what was expected of him.
He had to go to first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29 and one 32.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-olds was in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car near the critical 29-year-old, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be shot.
The investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that it was apparently a shooting between several armed people.
The elimination of semi-automatic weapons attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons has taken place.
It seems that this was definitely a long battle.
There were bricks on the street, on both sides of the side of the road.
So, according to all, there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the shooting," said the police captain of the Philadelphia Police Station Anthony Ginadi.
Many homes and cars in the area were also busy.
No arrests were made, and the police reportedly watched video surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was beaten in the hands of a crazy pull on Tuesday when she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby, and Lori?
That's what I call a women's Olympic gymnastics assembly this year and for several reasons.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnasts are in this collective role: Simona Bailz, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Ernandes, who have inspired so many black girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is a Jew, and Madison Coshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This collection looks like America at last.
This has also strengthened the black and Latin American women ' s presence at the top of this sport.
For the last four years, the female gymnast number was one African-American.
Last year Simon and Gabby were Nos.1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed him.
The world could now be a witness to the incredible three-time World Championship of Simona Bails, Douglas and Lori Ernandes, who are performing unexpected, yet virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday Simon became the fourth U.S. gold medal winner in a female individual absolute championship.
And a fellow at the Ellie Reisman's meeting made money.
We are witnessing the peak of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastic sections all over the country.
Simona, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Ellie and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They are "final five", because the next Olympic gymnast will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's training.
In fact, gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnasiums are first trained in private gymnasium clubs supported by parents paying for training, equipment, travel, form, contributions to competitions, hotel services (for coaches and their gyms and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gym clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where gymnasiums receive everything from their training, and this is a costly and long-term responsibility for gymnastics families.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Bails, and Maggie Hanny, coach Lori Ernandes, both trained their sportsmen since they took up gymnastics.
We must create a more affordable and affordable gymnastic education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnasium fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin American) and trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand in Detroit (my hometown) to provide a high-quality gymnast for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability for the exhausting work, discipline and resilience for the mind.
This combination has a positive impact on good health, school success and work throughout life.
It's the inspiration of this assembly that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that's wonderful.
Doing sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a great time now.
Thank you, Simona, Eli, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in the victory of the Olympic gold team and for encouraging so many girls of different origin to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors took the announcement of further beatings after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on the change by agreeing with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, said that NHS was on "no ground", and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first young doctors were transferred to a new contract, which included changes in working hours at night and departures to improve services at extra-hours.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee on Young Doctors" BMA, said yesterday evening in a statement: “The younger doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it is undergoing a crisis of labour force and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
It was only eight weeks before the first group of doctors was transferred to a new contract, required progress, and time on the basis.
The attempt by WMA to resolve the dispute with the negotiations was met with an unwillingness to act and sometimes with full silence by the Government.
And this is despite the promise of Jeremy Hunt last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Huntu needs to act now, encourage introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not do so, then the younger doctors are sure that they are ready to organize the next raids.
The last strike at the end of April delayed about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 hospital admissions, while nurses and consultants were involved in ensuring the replacement of doctors on the picketing line.
The Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants better pay for 54,000 young doctors who will be subject to the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Employers, called on young doctors not to continue beatings.
Mortimer said: "The strikes reach little or nothing, but they put pressure on those already working on the edge of the teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to the patients, the residents and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Young Doctors and, in conjunction with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of supervisors and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that the continued positive support on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility of education, additional training for those returning after a career break, the value of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender differences in medical work, were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Health Department were going to comply with the conditions achieved by WMA in November, February and May.
2 £ a day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack are going to use the drug for £2 per day, after the authorities have recommended that it be given more people and for longer periods.
The anti-ticagrelor agent reduces the risk of recurrences for people with heart disease.
The product is already appointed for 12 months after heart attack, reduced risk of stroke or new onset.
The NICE National Health Service advised the UK to give it to its people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service has now advised that it should be given to its subjects for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack will take place with about 140,000 people in England each year, and one more attack or stroke occurs in the fourth.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of blisters.
If the bottle breaks down on the part, it may cause a thrombosis that blocks blood to the heart and causes heart attack.
And if the tromb moves, it can move through the blood stream and block the blood to the brain, causing the stroke.
People who have already made one move are more at risk of getting another.
Tikagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making the trombos less likely.
The NICE project, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention methods, about four people with a heart attack will have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already undergone heart attack.
In recommending ticagrelor beforehand, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited after the expiry of three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment for longer than that period.
The culture of ownership of the PK allows the falsification of the count of votes in Muslim areas
Ex-Major Tower Hamletts Lutfur Rachman was removed from office last year because of corruption, using a government account
The culture of political reform has led to the closing of the eyes, which has been turned around by the widespread falsification of the count of votes in the Muslim communities, according to information from the devastating report of the Government published today.
The former member of the cabinet of ministers, Sir Eric Pickles, is being harassed with criticism of the police, election observers and city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations due to “excessive sensitivity to racial affiliation and religion”.
The former secretary of the local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of religious voters was so strong that the police had to allow border crossings to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity certificates to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters must only specify their name and address.
The report even proposes to wear unscrupulous ink on people's fingers when they submit their ballots, in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
There is a need to provide better protection to the public, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater press access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that is leading to it by hand," he said.
A report was made to the Downing Street as a result of a voting scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Court, considering election issues, decided that the current mayor, Luftur Rachman, had to be removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rachman had “skinned” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had to silence his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rachman said, "He had his campaign based on the duty of believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes cast doubts or were the result of a person ' s vote, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly concerned about the fraud of the post office in which the senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in his photo, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the requirement to give his identity certificate to prove who you are.
His report stated: “The evidence of the pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, was presented to vote at the will of the elders, especially in the communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“It was feared that... State institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour due to the excessive sensitivity of “political reform” to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on system cleaning, including the removal of political activists from work with postal ballots to stop the “collection of votes”.
The report of Teresa May also calls for rigorous checks on registration to prevent the use of the list of voters for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is considered to require the voter to issue an identity certificate before the vote.
Use unscrupulous ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballots to prevent someone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on people ' s nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Put in place a three-year limitation on applications for an automatic mail vote.
Remove political participants from the campaign and activists from the work of the pre-filled ballots and envelopes by post-voting.
To empower the police to establish borders around polling stations.
To amend the law in order to facilitate the prosecution of persons in intimidation in accordance with the Presentation of the National Act 1983.
To take illegal photographs at the polling stations.
To require only English to be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force the voters to go to a building by one.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, claiming that it was "disgusting", that no criminal charges had been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The electoral court disqualified Lutfur Rachman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal acts,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — for a number of reasons.
It also criticises the unrestrained "percussions for galloping" of the electoral registration divisions of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "The earlier ruling of the court in Tower Hamlets was a sign of prosecution.
Our nation has a proud heritage as a mother of parliamentary elections, and the alarming and secret dissemination of electoral fraud and the denial of some bodies threatens this good reputation.
Related to the idea of a bicycle analog Kate and other doubles of the Olympics in Rio
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week came with the mind of the French bicycle driver Polin Ferran-Prevo, which appeared to be impressive like the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic player is not the only sportsman fighting for gold this summer, who can be praised by his own famous twin — at least, according to reports in the neighborhoods.
Thus, in favour of Game Rio and all the famous people on our screens at the moment, the FEMAIL has made a list of Olympics more than the Hollywood Star surface.
Catcher and wolf: U.S. male teammate Bradie Ellison, on the left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's bicycle bike, many people have been able to point out how a certain container could be a twin of Leonardo DiCaprio superstar.
A member of the U.S. men's team, Brady Ellison, was the cause of a hurricane in Twitter after his images appeared, which looked like a horrendous Volk star with Wall Street.
And in fact, the priest learned about the madness of the sorcess and admitted that he had heard that he was like Leo since he was a child.
"I don't personally see a huge similarity, it may be except for vegetation on the face," said Breedy Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons in London in 2012 will no doubt indicate even more this year: the striking similarity between the British conjugation Greg Raserford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Ali Mustafin, with her big eyes, is said to be an exact copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Stefan.
And in the Basin of Southern Africa, Cameron Van der Burg was compared to the star of Mattie Morrison for many years.
Going to more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sport version" of the "Start" actor
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could be praised by similar heavy holes and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julia Efimova, can be praised not only with the same tanned skin and bright hair as Annalinn McCord's actress, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, is like Joseph Gorgon Levitta's "sport version."
Heavy Women: The Hope Solo Football Star, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same faces and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Creating the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason underlying the appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently went to the site to announce his caution that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter's actresses have amazingly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Lori Linnie, as well as the winning golden medal by Gabby Douglas, which can be praised with its own beautiful wide smile, which resembles the smile of the star Gabriel Union.
Olympiada's comment on CBC is apologised for saying that the Chinese fleet "died as a pig"
Analysis of Barron McDonald's fourth place at the end of 14-year-old Ay Janhan at the women's esophage, 4x200 m in the middle of CBC viewers in the direct broadcast of the Olympics
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese sailor "started as hen" and "dead as a pig" during the flooding.
Commentary Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female staphyte 4x200 m free style.
It was possible to hear McDonald, who was attracted to the CBC's comments team to "distribute her color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese has taken the ball out, kid."
She was too excited, started as a pig, died as a pig.
Thank you for that.
A 14 - year - old Chinese sailor, Ai Janhan, missed the second stage of the esophagus at 1:57,79 - for 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rack, allowing Canadians to remove their distance from China.
Viewers throughout Canada reacted quickly to the network after being shaken by tone and using expressions
Emmet McFarlane tweeted, "Is it really the CBC dictator who just said that 14-year-olds from China were "dead like a pig"??"
This idiot didn't realize they were still in the air."
About Ay Janhan from China at the women's final 4x200 m in free style, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has taken the ball out, baby."
The criticism in Twitter immediately reached the Baron McDonald, and many called for him to be fired.
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: 'Nothing for herself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who had transferred the CBC, apologized in the direct air for the MacDonald's comment, saying, 'We apologize for the comment on the landing made in the air.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
The SBS concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who quoted in response to the statement
Scott Russell's friend had to apologize to McDonald
CBC then copied and apologized to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
Telescene was also quick to apologize and to issue a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to enter the air.
Yesterday night we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers in the direct air and our subscribers in the neighborhood.
Let's make it clear that the Beyron comments were about the speaker's speech, not about her personality.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized in the direct air and tried to clarify his comment, claiming that he did not think his words were interpreted as an assault on the person.
'I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the woman',' he said on the broadcast of the CBC Olympics.
'I've been talking about the speech of a sailor, not about her personally.'
'It is clear to myself that there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry.'
Buyer Primark insulted a woman who unscrupulously copied the lower white in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to take a look when some woman found out to sample the truss, on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she imitated how she looked at them, walled them, and put them back on the pole.
She continued her search and eventually killed four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkston.
Primark Shop of Bouverie Place Trade Centre in Folkston, where a woman was wearing tricycles before putting them back on the pole
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the lower white sample, the pregnant woman had re-dressed and left the store without buying anything.
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shop room, she took a couple of rabbits out of the window, took off her own colognes and rabbits and ate them.
"She didn't try to find a spare place to do it -- she was just standing there without a trace."
"They all got up when she took off her shirts again, and they obviously didn't like it because she put them back on the pole."
She did the same with three other couples before finally decided that there was nothing she would like to do, dressed again and gone.
"It doesn't look like she cared for who watched her, or thought about the man who eventually bought those rabbits that she's been looking for."
The 33-year-old Jenny Davidson of Kent said, "How wrong it is to think that someone is going to take the truce home that someone has already worn, and they have not been pushed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to get these items out of the store after she left for the better."
"I don't want to come home with a new pair of women's trousers and find out that the other woman was on and off, and they weren't pushed."
Representative Primark reported: "Prmark knows about the incident that happened in our stock store in Folkston on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks Using a Cow
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizarachi, the master of the Federation of Horses in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether they come to you in front or behind, this video will show you how to beat the thief with his own weapons.
If you approach the back, as Mizrachi says, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'release the line of fire'.
Then you firmly bend the gun between your forehead and your shoulder before hitting them with a free spot.
Then the knee should be in the breath, and as long as the attacker turns away from the pain, you pull the gun out of his hand, beat him in the face, and leave him behind, holding the gun pointed at him.
For the armed, fit forward, the way in which to carry out the likes - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly catch the gun and shake it so that the villains can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight of the gun and hit it with an arrow in the chest, then pull the gun out of its grip before you go back and aim at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how Misraki is doing.
But remember, the safest way to get out of any robbery is if you're not the master of the game, it's to give your money.
For the traveller, Jan Wright uses his language in the most filthy places in Europe
The British traveler has undergone a severe test of his immune system and a radical reflex, vilifying some of the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The leader and author of Jan Wright's travel books, 51, from Saffol, conducted the euro banknotes, Circa Piccadilla's pearls, a push-button on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before you could see every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it's going into.
But the experiment, which should become a film called the Guide to the Internal Force, has given some surprising results.
The idea of licking the smudge button in a train used by thousands of others may be extremely repulsive, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen closet.
During the entire trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and nurses about the increase in oxygen bacteria and its own health.
Luckily, none of the scars brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for his tests on the strength of his backpack, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public beads in the cars to the Unitase wash button, this task certainly tested its immune system.
In the film he was filming, he said, "From childhood, I was totally unconcerned about my health, and I carried a lot of stuff out of my mouth, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused is a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test brain showed the value of a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison: only empty hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while just empty hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a film about a traveler called the Guide to the Internal Force, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet.
In a movie, he said, "This is close to one of the worst things I've ever had in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to hurt anything, because it's ominous.
The Guide to the Internal Force of the Traveller-Lizuna was taken off with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
The company provided Rita Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human bacterium and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio on snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up calling Jan.
They claim that interest in the health of the mine is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a much larger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of oxygen health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the pocket is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the film director, added, 'Let's say I'd lose respect for Jan, if he had seen some of the things that I asked for, for example, a disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, some things made Jan easier to do, and some were rather harsh.
I'm glad some of these scars made us fall asleep.'
During a survey carried out in 2015 in Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked oxygen to only the good condition of the stomach and bladder, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes the products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The Huligan family destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornwall, before eviction
The Hooligans left their municipal home with a loss of £ 50,000 after they had been evicted for intimidation of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkoka, were expelled from their real estate facility in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forcedly evicted from the real estate site, the shocked construction cooperatives found the real estate in a condition that required repair.
The walls were left with visible holes, the semi-trailers were exposed, the debris was scattered over the floor, and the walls were scratched with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna Macevoy, a exile in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid not to save him.
She said, 'This was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live that way.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this property is likely to be known as a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys foolish glory, and their name enjoys foolish glory.
Couples of three sons who have lived in the real estate since time and the police report that the reign of terror caused by the family has included street fights with baseball bits, intimidation of neighboring areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and abuse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behaviour in June.
In a few rooms of the house that might be laid down, there was an old garbage store.
Gender boards in a house where drugs were sold in the past were exhausted
Neighbors say they saw the dragons on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they had been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was easily welcomed by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into a real hell.
One of them said, "They didn't worry about anybody."
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is amazing.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we didn't get used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the leader of the Cornwall Housing neighbourhood group, said that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police
Musores and old toys were flung down on the edge of the municipal home
He added: 'This is the view that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, because eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, since the conduct was limited, and their actions must have been horrifying to its observers.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to neighbors and will signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but he said that they all had a little more than 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the burned houses after eviction
Disposal workers will now have to remove the musor’s chest that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police set up a search in the house and found more than 70 g of rope, as well as weights, related belongings and £ 1700 cash.
Skeldon was fined after he was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She said the money went to pay for her son's funeral, Li Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in the Plimote.
The walls of many of the houses were scratched with graffiti on the entire surface.
Police say they will try to expel tenants who are not subject to the rental rules of the premises
Angela Crou, from Devon and Cornwall police, stated that this eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
She said, "This is a message for those who feel that they can bring about themselves without any accusation, and those who cause harm to themselves."
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low - flying warplane barely hit the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists worshiping sundials were terrified of their lives
P-3C Orion Air Force Flight Portugal flew incredibly low
Air Force reported that it had conducted a training flight but insisted on a lack of security risk
This is the moment when the frightened tourists start panicking, while the low - flying plane hovered over the overcrowded beach.
A military aircraft in dramatic formations is seen flying off the sand traps in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The restoratives jumped on their feet as soon as they became aware of the noise of the aircraft's engines, but could not see what was moving in their direction through the cloud.
The incident happened last night not far from the city of Aviru in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the few vacationers who posted a video of a shocking spring in social networks, said, "He flew down twice, and there was a moment when it was time that he was going to break up."
Nuno Arrogah added, "I took care of the serfing and I swear it was such a feeling that the plane was going to fall on me."
Tourists on the Aveiro Beach were terrified when the plane appeared from the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the P-3C Orion aircraft operated a training flight to detect fishing vessels at the shore, and had to relax so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said that the plane flew a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by the smoke from nearby hot forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the native part of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances — dense fog and the power of forest fires that had worse visibility
The aircraft was operated by a training flight and the pilot was ordered to detect fishing boats under the task
The HASSP system has been mandatory for the community for more than a year, but most of the coffee and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, Russian version of HASP) system has been examining risks and critical control points - mandatory for food producers and carriers, as well as companies in the field of housing in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
Business checks carried out by the Rossus-Observer for compliance with these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
However, officials have issued fines only for certain violations of the regulation (see "Average of Documents" ...).
The non-implementation of the regulation is generally limited to a company of 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
As a system that takes into account the risks associated with and preventing food, has been developed in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food security for astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food companies not only in the United States but also in Canada and the EU.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating in the TS territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years old (the need for HICPs appeared in the TS regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule concerns only food products, not restaurants, - explained the Head of the General Council of Elena Ceretel.
Now they're all trying to get lost.
The expected period for the renewal of the charter voyages to Turkey, at the end of August, began in September.
But they won't challenge the ambitious demand, because their target audience -- family with children -- is already preparing for school, experts say.
Yesterday, the Alliance of Tourist Agencies sent a letter to the Government asking the charters to be approved.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of choosing quality and accessible sea rest is unsolved, as most accommodation facilities have been banned in the Krasnodar Country and the Republic of Crimea before the end of September”, notes the authors and stresses that the opening of charter transport in August does not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian sea tourism.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union for Industry (RST), if Russian and Turkish aviation authorities agree quickly, the return of charter flights to Turkey can be expected for a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters are renewed, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
They are technically able to fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly set up programmes and agree with the airlines on board," said Pavel Rumiantzev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Bureau of the RST.
He said that it was possible to renew the charters - good news, but it did not have much effect on the market, because the main buyers of the charters - family and children - had already returned from their vacations and had prepared for school or had a vacation in other countries.
In the barricade season, tours are bought mainly by lonely travelers and couples.
Charter programmes can be expected for those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously," said Pavel Romanians.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it now offers a lot of budget proposals -- 50-60,000 rubles for two tours, because there are people who are looking forward to a lot of cheap tours," says Valeria Rosental, Director General of Optio-Travel.
In another case, it is certainly not worth spending on recreation - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul Romanians also believes that since there is a demand for regular travels in Turkey, the charters will also be demanded, but the wait is not worth it.
"For Turkey the launch of charters is now a repetition of the next season," said Paul Romanians.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season," said Valeria Rubzova.
The tax code provides for the exemption from NDFL provided by law from compensation payments within the limits of approved rules relating to the reimbursement of damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
For workers employed in work with harmful working conditions, the prescribed standard milk provision is Article 222 TC RF.
The same rules and conditions for extradition are laid down by the Order of the Russian Minhravos Development of 16.02.2009, No. 45n.
According to this document, the free issue of milk or other foodstuffs is made to workers on actual days of employment in work with harmful working conditions due to harmful production factors at work.
On the basis of those rules, the Russian FNSF concluded in the letter in question that, under paragraph 2 (3), 217 NC RFs were exempt from the NDF's income in the form of the value of milk issued to workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Standards and conditions approved by the Order of the Russian Ministry of Development dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
The Moscow Gastrowbank has been unlicensed by the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked a licence for bank operations to the credit organization of the Shareholding Commercial Bank "GAZSTROIBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GAZSTROIBANK AKB conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of cash in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a credible reflection of the value of the bank's assets have given rise to a credit organization's reasons for implementing bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The bank shall be appointed by a temporary administration until the date of appointment in a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization have been suspended under federal laws.
AKB GAZROIBANK is a contributor to the deposit insurance system.
Let us recall that the payment of insurance compensation to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On the insurance of contributions of individuals to the banks of the Russian Federation " provides for a 100% balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million dollars in total per investor.
Payments, according to the Investment Insurance Agency, will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, on 1 August 2016, the assets of the AKB AKB "GAZSTROIBANK" were held by 335 members of the RF banking system.
London School, which joined IGIL, was killed in Syria
Cadiz Sultan, one of three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join the IGIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family knew about her death in Rake, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is supposed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Racka, a wave of groupings in the country, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just once when she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of this is that it is the overcrowding and conspiracy of others, that it is the risks involved when travelling to the war zone, to convince people to make the same choice at any time," Akundji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schools from eastern London settled on a plane in Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said that she had married an IGIL fighter in Syria and had been widowed for several months.
Reed claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Judge in the event of election
The leader of the Democrats in the Harry Reed Senate said he was convinced that the democratic candidate in President Hillary Clinton would appoint Judge Mary Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as President.
The Republicans blocked Garland's claim, and President Barack Obama appointed it in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Mitch McConnell Senate said that the next president would choose the man who would be able to replace the last Judge of the Supreme Court, Antonine Skalia.
Reed said at the conference on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence".
Representative Reed later said that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to put Garland out and just made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "scram the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Reed said that the Republicans that block Garland's nomination were "acceptable" and "persons" of the Republican candidate in President Donald Trump.
He said the Trump wasn't fit for the post.
Treatments states that erotic calendars for women as well as for men
The Journal of Treatments collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to release the 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of being famous, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a large number of modeled models differs from old-fashioned Playboys, because Playboy is for men.
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar too.
"We need to return to the exhibition of an eternal and classically decorated figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful art.
Models can be photographed online or personally on open casts in Los Angeles and New York.
They're going to give Moscow memories of unfavourable Internet stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memory that will tell us how not to become a victim of the Internet store.
This was reported in the Rosary Guard, written by M24.
It is reported that experts in the agencies are preparing a memory that will help citizens to choose the Internet store correctly and identify possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make the claim right and so on." - explained in the Rosary.
The memory is being developed so far.
Subsequently, it will be located on the Rossum Oversight site in Moscow, also planned to release a printed version and to distribute it to the mosquitoes.
MIDI Russia issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the organization of the conflict in Crimea.
Citizens of Ukraine and Russia were detained who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them is Mr. Evgenien Alexanderovich and Mr. Zahey Andrei Romanovic.
"They all give acknowledgeable testimony," says the report.
A former resident of Zaporozian Evgenien Panov, who had been detained for suspected crime in Crimea, admitted his guilt for interrogation.
FAS costs Google 438 million rubles.
The Russian Federal Antitrust Service (FAS) has appointed an administrative fine for the Google Corporation of 438 million rubs, said on the agency website.
"The fine for a violation of anti-monopoly legislation was 438 million rubs.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future," said FAS Deputy Head Alexey Docenko.
During the FAS investigation, it was found that Google is supplying smartphones that are sold in Russia, the Google Play app shop only provided that other corporate apps will be installed on the device.
These annexes include a search system that should be placed on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10 of the Law on the Protection of Competition (use of dominant position).
We are confident that compliance with the requirement will provide an opportunity to develop competition in Russia's mobile market, which will benefit our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies whose products are placed on the territory of the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, including," noted the Head of the Office of Communications and Information Technology Management of the FAS of Russia Elena Zaeva.
The government suspects 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network was charged with selling the book "50 days before my suicide."
The "New Book" Web Store for the sale of the book Stace Kramer "50 days before my suicide," reports the Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in the Rosproz watch, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be seen as “promoting or motivating the suicide of children and adolescents”.
The District Court confirmed the violation of the established disclosure requirements for children of the information product and decided to impose a fine in the form of a fine of 49 copies of the printed product seized by the Rossus-Opserver administration.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookstores were being screened for the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow, the memory of Ernst the Unknown will be spent the night.
In Moscow, the memory of the sculptor Ernst Unknown will be spent the night, reports the TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Literacy House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
It was therefore decided to establish this evening for those who want to mention it on their own land," said the Russian Jewish Congress press.
It was noted that it was important for the widow of Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
During the evening, close friends of the Unknown, including Evgenien Eutushenko poet, artist Boris Messerer, President of the GMI, Puškina Irina Antonov, director Mark Rosovski, as well as Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinski, Head of the Department of Culture of Moscow Aleksandr Kibovski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pečtanikovi.
It was previously reported that the family of Ernst the Unknown planned to carry out a panihiid on a sculptor in New York, allegedly by 14 August.
The final consumer was guilty: Who really buys the plastics?
A single middle-aged man loves guilt.
And until you've been exposed to a section of comments with gross insults under the pseudonym Ne AllOdiniki Men's MiddleLett, this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussion about the recycling of plastics is due, not to the boom of the two-month generation, which wants to penetrate a new material object, but to the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who have recently purchased a wine album c most of the probability are 45 to 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those of the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It is also not just a facilitator collection act - it is emotional: older buyers have been more likely to have their feelings in them (56 per cent versus 53 per cent) and enjoy their loneliness (69 per cent versus 66 per cent).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking through the center of Soho's relived street, in a modest gray suit and horribly gestured in front of the stop, laying hands and saying something impressive, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly waving away from its charms and charms — hotels, cafes, shops of Paperchase have now filled the buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several musical stores with fantastic specialists have remained.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next stage, where I am close to different people in some of these shops and try to assess their age and emotional attitude by monitoring.
Glasgo Stuart, 55 years old, whom I was walking from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably more than 20 years old), in London for a full day to meet, and walking through stores to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I'm asking?
"I believe so," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 plastics.
These tiles, shown above (he sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), go through the walls of his hotel.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partly due to his available income: he can now buy plastics that he could not afford when they only went out and buy the items he sold when he was young and on the mill.
"Many of what I'm buying is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plastics are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Wez, 25 years old, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are in line with the YouTube profile.
He noted, however, the new concern of the people who were affected by the noise in the media, the people who had heard of the return and had felt the duty to buy their old plates.
According to the conversations I had, people were released from their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who have ever sold their fault to buy compact discs now sell their compact discs to buy their plastics," he says.
This may explain the boom among the rebirthers due to a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plastics?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store, such as Phoenix, to understand that plastic shops offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wesa, some older clients, in particular, have been abused by a non-profit pay system.
Some wine lovers may feel awe of the digital world and prefer to be removed from the permanent known envelopes for plastics, items that arouse memories of unmistakable youth.
"I think that sometimes it may be a filling of emptiness or a possession of material things as a kind of relief," Wez says.
Because I'm a collector, I have it, and I think many people have it.
It's a simple way to take over your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from a plastic locker.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50 per cent of the people who bought the wine album last month had not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent had a player they never used, while 7 per cent did not have a plastic player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously disappointed, embittered with the Bosano people.
The "Trophyne" aspect of the rebirth is what Johnny, 42 years old, observed in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came up recently and said, "I don't have a plate player, but I want to buy a radiohead, so we can put it to ourselves," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's definitely going to happen.
It's more of a piece, less of music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plate player."
They're younger people, they're not older, they're a little less than 20 people who just know about it.
Fopp, who's now taking almost all the wine floor, has a much more diverse audience when I'm coming.
There are couples who, in 70 years of age, are photographed by tourists, wealthy boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less unencumbered than in the above-mentioned shops, the latest synthetic and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than the jazz improvisation, is being penetrated through columns, it is pleasant to see the variety in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to find a painful psychological trauma that's been around for 30 seconds.
Eleonora, 27 years old, walked on Fop for a few minutes, considering the different plates available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She didn't make much, she said, so she didn't collect the plates.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or another device is simple, but the beauty of the wine is ..." - it's filled with dreams of a breath filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unrepeatable.
My last stop is a shop that, as they say, has contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers, guilty of urban fashion.
While I'm making an illusion that I'm looking at ginsy hanging shorts, I'm watching a bunch of teenage girls, every minute they're gathering around the Polaroid camera, before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of the Crosley player.
The left is a ladder with a wall of Adele, Jeffa Bakli, Amy Winhaus and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, binding plates for any medium-sized collection.
No one sees — perhaps because they are mere decorations, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's the current "crime guilt."
However, given that any attracting attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depth of Soho for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that the layer of the population, which is more likely to have more time and money than most, is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury items, such as wine.
But as far as my findings show that the results of YouTube are accurate, at least in Soho plastic shops, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and lovers of wine that exist in reality, in plastic shops and online forums.
These people are probably working at school or in offices.
But apparently they don't do it on Thursday morning, walking through the shops of plastics on Bervik Street, pasting plastics and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader who writes on the shoulders of no-suspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland’s polar shark — the longest - alive ring animal — video report
Scientists claim that Greenland’s polar shark has the largest life span of all world bells.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record has placed a female age of 272 to 512 and a length of 5 m.
The French court rejects the proposal to take down a shop in the Jungli refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer by the Kale authorities to remove dozens of individual shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings this week, the Kale authorities said that the State should be able to dispose of 72 individual shops where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer 50 cents of tea (40r) or simple meals for several euros in self-catering restaurants.
Prefecture Kale said that these places should be removed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they are at risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vitally necessary, stating that free custody offered by the pro-government association and other groups does not provide sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp.
They said that private shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Lila Court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel the people who managed 72 individual stores, but stated that the problems of Kale prefecture were “full of understanding”.
Judge Jean-François Mola said that bakeries, coffee and restaurants played a lot more than just feeding people who "live in extreme conditions."
He said that space provided peaceful meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the nose was the children ' s coffee book Jungley at the camp, which worked for no benefit and offered 200 lunches a day, English and French courses and asylum consultations for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escorting to the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect children's coffee.
The letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not over eight years old".
Two charity agencies, Refugee Assistance and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number in the Jungli camp had increased and exceeded 9 000 people — the highest in all history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.

Britain stands for silver in Regbi-7, after the master-class Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Britain in Regbi-7 was convulsively halted at the final obstacle of Fiji's team in the finals on Thursday evening, when they were completely smashed 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given master class on the control of the ball, stockpiling, removals, support of the game, running the lines and the rough force to win the gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was not too poor in the form of a silver - third in Britain - and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Regbi-7, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on their way.
The painful slaughter of Boxes, 7-5 in the semifinals earlier that day, could have returned to negatively affect them in the finals.
But, no matter what, Fiji won as much as a team of 15 men.
This may be a bit of comfort for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will wear a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Chief Coach Fiji - Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was some kind of trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one here.
These strikes will cause pain, but progress is disastrous.
Fiji started off with a great deal of fun, trying to catch up with the British.
It was like getting stuck on a bus column for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Collinsau entered the corner.
The name of the four minutes in the hours of Jerry Tuwa added another tautdown on the right flag, which was realized.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to capture Mitchell kept Leon Nakarov from killing a third, but it only kept Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremaloua made a right-hand round, and the UK played 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resume and there were still more minutes... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravavo then broke through a few more major attempts to capture Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
Implementation led to 29-0 breaks.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play in Regbi-7, while Britain was still in possession of handcuffs.
Which is quite the same.
The United Kingdom has done mass replacements for half the game, and they have collected a Fijian dam for all four minutes, which was good at the standards of the first half until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took the attempt for Britain, made a tachtdown in the left corner to make the account 36-7, but the game took a long time on the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, played with flags and danced in the courts.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji's approach.
Mata William has decorated a Fijian cake that didn't need to be decorated, another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians wrapped up, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely victorious.
Earlier that same day Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in its semifinal, and the United Kingdom had a little bit of South Africa in a tense semifinal one attempt for each, the difference in British implementation.
Kyle Brown pulls out the Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work, broke his leg and hit the bars in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt by Marcus Watson, the 15th brother on the side of the English team, Anthony, to win — and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning were inspired to win a hard fight for cancer coaches.
There won't be more gold in these games, and that's what it says.
From the first to the last, 220 heavy gains in history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning found their added value at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who had stretched the belts, there were three voices in this boat, coach Robin Williams echoed while they were always striving for the second round of Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in British sports annals who reached such an altitude.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unconquered speech, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant sportsmen who wander on the surface with the elegance of the liver do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
After every gold battalion's scratch, ready hands that contribute to the gradually growing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live until he saw the day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had a tumor tumor, which is one of the things they can operate, and they did it.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
That could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's kind of changing your way for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment early in 2014 in the interseason, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it could be a correct expression in such circumstances as these.
I needed to pay, so I needed to make a quick adjustment.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, and I was walking in the room — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they were saying a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The handle itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after the victory was their first thought about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, Captain of the Artillery Police, with the service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a little cliché, but that means so much."
It just confirms how much that means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
These were fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not ask for a better training partner or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning have not lost any race in five years.
This couple has a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to get closer, Stanning and Glover had too much stock.
We were in a lot of trouble.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get in.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do something amazing.
We didn't expect firefighters today, we just waited for us to be able to do well and get out and win this race, which we did.
A couple will need a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with Steve Beckshaw's TV screen.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government extended the period for the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the period for the destruction of food prohibited for imports into Russia.
The decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, which was published on the official legal portal.
The embargo was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended several times and is now in force until 31 December 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, commodities and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and milk products were prohibited.
The use of food imported into the country under the embargo is being carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only for the 1st quarter of 2016, around 100 tonnes of prohibited products were withdrawn from the sale.
The desire for "ban"
On Friday in Moscow, rain and hail are expected.
An atmospheric front will pass through the chair region, which will cause precipitation and lower the air temperature.
During the day, the air goes up to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C].
Yes, on Saturday night in Moscow places will be a short-term rain, possible thunderstorms and windfalls up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain with the wind and wind breaks up to 12-17 m/s.
The rains are also forecasted in the Orlova, Kursk and Vronez areas, reported "Dni.ru".
The next working week is unlikely.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to WTO.
"This is the first case when the WTO took a decision against the RF," says the statement on the official website of the organization.
However, the referees stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were "systematic" or "wide-based".
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt the import duties on paper and refrigerated paper as soon as possible.
This is stated in a communication from the Ministry of Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the conduct of the United States in resolving WTO disputes undermines the principles of discussion.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other members of the WTO because of the refusal of Americans to approve for the second time by South Korean Judge Chan Son Hwa.
Russia will therefore not address the WTO on the issue of western sanctions imposed against the FP.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now made up of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's administration changed the manager
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his own administration, former Deputy Sergey Ivanov Antonio Wyno.
Vladimir Putin moved to the President ' s administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wyno said at the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that had begun to be the head of President Ivanov's administration and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, “Reports” said that experts considered the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of director of the administration of transparent and understandable and translation would not change anything in principle in the work of the administration of Kremlin.
They note that the leader who worked with the President's administration for a long time has effectively implemented the activities of the AP.
He was replaced by the Deputy Head of the Administration, Anton Wyno, a man who had a good knowledge of the specificities of the work.
In Poland, they say they won't buy gas fuel.
The Polish State Oil Supply PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years' time, gas supplies from the FP may become attractive to it because of a re-orientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
The Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Boguslav Majez, informed of this.
His word is passed by the TACs.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines will become the East, the core of the SPG terminals and Norway," Majezz said.
Gasprom is currently dominant in gas supplies in Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had placed almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, which was 30 per cent higher than in 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Let us recall that on 22 July, the Polish anti-monopolies department did not agree to the establishment of a joint venture "Gazproma" and its European partners for the construction of the "North Stream-2" gas pipeline.
During this month, Poland has left a request for Gasprom to supply 11 billion cubic metres of gas to North Stream-2.
The Vice-President of the Dutch Government, Alexander Medvedev, said so.
The "North Stream-2" auction will be held in 2017 and the auction will be scheduled in autumn 2016 on its site.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the Polish party's intention to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, a Vice-President of the administration of Alexander Medvedev said.
He recalled that in the 1st quarter of this year, the Polish had only increased by 42 per cent of the gas purchase from the FP.
Zapred Gazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG had made a statement to the Stockholm Arbitration Court did not mean that the negotiations had not yet been closed.
The Polish company had previously appealed to the court to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
The Polish gas and energy infrastructure authority, Petri Naimsky, recalled that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gazprom.
Poland's contract with Gasprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the authorized Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure, Petri Naimsky, stated that his country could withdraw from the supply of blue fuel from the east six years later.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will unite the country with the Norwegian Shelf.
"North Stream-2" provides for the construction of two marine gas pipelines of a total capacity of 55 billion cubic m of gas per year from Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea in Germany.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMI) has increased the number of observers around the Ukraine border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first M.M.M. locker in Ukraine by Alexander Hughes.
"I can confirm that the IMF has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, in answer to the journalist's question, "the RIA News".
According to the OSCE, the situation at the border of Ukraine and Crimea is peaceful, there is no record of incidents affecting security.
Observers tracked the three crossing points across the Russian-Ukraine border.
There was a video showing on the ground at the airport of Ufa, the Jak-42 passenger plane, which was driven outside the flight-arrival area for 400 m and landed on the left wing.
He posted a video on the 360 telechannel.
The CPC occurred at 4.30 a.m. in Moscow.
CrasAvia's flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where there were no casualties.
Only the aircraft was transported to the station.
Oufa Airport is operating in a normal way.
The Freight Investigation Office of the SCR was involved in identifying the reason for the severe landing of the liner aircraft.
UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the occupied areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict reject the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers the fact that the incident was undisputed.
Such statements were preceded by the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists launched an investigation into chemical weapons reports in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the use of toxic gas, supposedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that in an area where the Russian military-transport helicopter had been hit recently, the aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow the charges were called a waste.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group Harakat Nur ad-Din al-Zinky.
It soon became known that two toxic bombs were launched.
That's confirmed by the BBC one of the victims.
"Just a few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the burning of my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," he quoted the audience as saying.
At least 7 people died as a result of the attack, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the poison gas is confirmed by experts, actions will be regarded as a military crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: "The evidence that this really happened is a lot."
The prohibition of the use of chlorine for military purposes is contained in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo makes it difficult for the shootings of its areas to take place every day, and terrorists prevent the city from getting out of the city.
As Reuters reports, the UN is awaiting a "humanitarian pause" from Russia in military action.
The current system of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered to be “adequate to help almost 2 million civilians who have been hunted”.
Counsellor Staffhan de Mistura de Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egelan said that a 48-hour cease-fire would be required to deliver and evacuate the sick and injured from there every week.
"We have to send abundant cargo from the colonized truck to a place where the roads are almost destroyed and what remains is buried," said Mr. Egelan. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed the readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations continued in Geneva between the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause”.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
On 11 August, Russia announced that a three-hour cease-fire regime would be in place for the Syrian city of Aleppo, the second-large Syrian city, which would operate daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is intended to ensure conditions for delivery to the city of medicine, food and items of the first need.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence has been taken in the light of the increasing international pressure on Moscow, with the requirement of returning the military operation and facilitating the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in Thai courts, four people were killed.
A few explosions went up south of Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed and 19 were wounded.
The epicenter of explosions came to the city of Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners were among the victims, four citizens were not Russians.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken over by any of the terrorist groups, but the IMF has hastened to declare that Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained, suspected of explosions.
According to preliminary local police data, the magnitude and specificity of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the warlords.
The attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including the Patong Beach in the Phuqueta area and the city of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
Following the arrival of a military junta in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that demonstrated development.
In 2016, the country had already visited 14 million people, with 1.5 million more indicators for 2015.
The first suspects involved in the preparation and organization of the attacks were already detained, reported police Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.
While speaking early on about the goal, he added, however, in the IMF, “it is certain that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
It was too early to make any conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly linked to any kind of terrorism, in fact they are local diversions, and we are trying to identify the individuals behind them.
The explosions occurred on the day of the birth of Queen Tilanda Sikrit.
The Thai hunta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to the statements of the police general, Sítchichaya Srisopacharoenrate, the bombs were blown away at a distance of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees on the lively streets filled with food in the restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead became a Thai girl who was trading in street food.
The identity of the remaining victims is unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italians and Austrian citizens.
Russians are not among the victims of the explosions, reported the Rosturism press service.
The local experts also link the explosions to the referendum on 7 August, on which 61.4% of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Committee for the Development of a Constitution appointed by the military junta.
It was necessary to determine whether they supported the system in which the Supreme House of Parliament was fully appointed as military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the Pruuta Chan-Ocha army.
At this point, he said, the army had raised an ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military set up the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced the commandal time and censorship, sparked protests and the upper chamber of Parliament.
How Bangkok turned out to be an emergency
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, announced in January 2014 the introduction of an emergency situation in Bangkok and the capital of the provinces.
The special regime extended for 60 days.
As in Bangkok, there were two explosions.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred at the Bangkok centre at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, resulting in 28 people being injured, five of them being in critical condition.
The explosions were made by unknown motorcycles.
The authorities have strengthened the security measures in the capital and have attracted the military forces to protect the protesters.
In Sukh Loge, conditions began to develop.
As “U” became known, the Government was invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the gold-plated settlement of Suhay Log with the maintenance of two key constraints.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies with 25 per cent or more of foreigners and those claimants whose capital is not at least 25 per cent of the attendance.
The industry does not expect the Government to prescribe conditions, noting that many players are not at risk of taking a complex and expensive project.
The auctions can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministries introduced to the Government a draft order and conditions of auction for the largest undeveloped gold settlement in Russia Suhay Log (Irkutsk Area, Stocks and Resources 130 million U.S.), explained two sources known to the situation.
The project has been introduced on Wednesday evening, and one of them has been clarified.
The project has been introduced to the Government by the U.S.
The representative of the driving non-use of Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Chloponina said "U", that the project had not yet been implemented in the staff member's office.
"The auction may be announced already in August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and, taking into account the time limit for the collection of requests by potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may take place already in October," they say in Minprida.
According to “U” data, the project maintained two key requirements for potential participants in the option that was sent to the ministries and FOIVs in July (it is with “U”).
First, there are at least 25% attendance in the applicant's capital.
Second, the refusal to have access to the auction for foreign investors was based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investment in strategic societies.
According to the two FZ articles, as already written "U" on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are not tax residents of the FP or have dual citizenship may not be admitted to the auction.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Suhai Log is a federal failure (a reserve of more than 50 tons of gold).
The project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details before the Government.
The demand for participation in the capital of the auction participants was raised by the Irkutsk Region, spoke "U" in Munich in December 2015 and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to Minpurda by his predecessor Sergei Eroshenko, "I had an agreement on investment with Rosteh".
Those who lobbyed the restrictions on the admission of foreigners do not specify the "U" interviewees.
"But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control to the largest gold settlement in Russia in the face of Western sanctions," says the interviewer "U", who is familiar with the preparations for the auction.
On 1 August, the Head of the Commonwealth of Sergei Donski stated that foreigners could "go to the consortium" if the applicants attracted them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
Conference members considered it unlikely that conditions would be adjusted in the Government.
The main candidate at Suhay Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold buyer of RF PAO Polus, the subsidiary son of Suleiman Kerimov Saydu, and Rosteh.
As written by "U", in July partners created S.P.L. Gold, where P.L. had 51% share in the R.T.R.R.R. structure - 49%.
In Rosteh, the comments were rejected, in Poland, declared "U", that "no doubt interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the announcement of the conditions," they added to "Polish".
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision of the RF Government has been called "U".
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Čukotke, said that they could participate in the drawing up of the Suhago Loga, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "U", were not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Industrialists RF Sergei Kashuba assessed U's investment in Suhay Log in December 2015 at $2.5-4 billion.
The majority of potential applicants are not only deterring the volume of investment, but also the complexity of the project: there is a need for serious expertise in stockpiles and complex technology, explains the "U" interviewers in the industry.
In the pension market, M&A -- the KIT Finance Pension Administrator -- launched the merger process of four NPFs.
As a result, the Gazfund Pension Stockpiles will create an NPF of approximately 373 billion rubles.
On the start of the merger procedure of the four pension funds: “KIT Finance”, “Promogrofund”, “Inheritance” and “Gazfund Pension Stocks”, the owner of 100% of the OBO “KIT Finance Pension Administrator” yesterday.
“Reorganization is carried out in accordance with the CB, in compliance with the requirement that the terms of the existing treaties be not deteriorating,” the company said in its communication.
The association is based on the Gazfund Pension Stockpiles.
As the Director-General of the NPF, Oleg Bealošicki, the pooling of funds has a number of objectives: to increase the geography of the presence, to concentrate resources for development, to reduce costs, to diversify the best practices of each of the funds and to optimize corporate governance.
According to him, the indicative date for completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result, the Gazfund Pension Stockpiles will be the largest player on the ODA market.
As of 31 March, the amount of pensionable stocks of the pooled funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As reported on the fund website, the beneficiaries of their owner -- the KIT Finances Pension Administrator -- are now Anatolia Gavrilenko (under the control of the Gazfund (65 per cent) and NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself started much later on.
Yes, the O1 NPF Sub-Control Group for the Future swallowed Stalfand early this year.
Currently, this joint NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Joint into a single structure, apart from reducing costs, is necessary to meet structural challenges," notes NPF Director-General Nikolai Sidorov.
The active work on fund consolidation since April is also being carried out in the Saffmar pension group - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regional Fund " , should be included in Saffmar NPF by the end of the current year.
In 2017, NPF Deveria will join them.
"The pooling of funds will have an effect on increased control of risks, operating processes and costs", noted in the Saffmar pension group.
A break in the pool of funds sustained by the KIT Finance Manager may be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs have not been able to buy more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively deployed.
Following amendments to the CB decision in March of this year, there are no longer any restrictions on certain issuers that comply with the regulatory requirements.
If necessary, the issue can buy out one major game," says the Director of the Akra Financial Institutions Ratings Group, Jury Nogin.
Several top-15 NPF managers have another possible reason for the break-up and consequently staff appointments in a single fund, which should have been agreed upon by the group ' s owners.
Yesterday, Anatolie Gavrilenko was not available for comments.
At the request of "U" in NPF, Gazfund did not respond either.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and under-priority activity, this decision will be justified at a long time.
According to the Director-General of the Pension Partner, Sergey Okolesnov, the Gazfonda Pension Stocks is less inflows, and accession will stabilize the base of other group funds.
In this way, more successful experience will be gained from the KIT Finance and Programfonda NPFs in the construction of different ODA sales, as well as the use of more modern PDOs.
The requirements of CBs for NPF processes and staff are constantly growing, so to double the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy is not appropriate, the Managing Director of the Corporate Ratings Expert RA, Pavel Mitrofanov.
“Effects from reducing double functions clearly exceed the possible cost of mergers”, notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of bringing together the four funds Sergey Okolesnov is estimated at 30 to 50 million rubles.
"The cost of the four funds of this size is approximately 400 million rubs a year, with the medium-term consolidation of the budget actually reducing twice," Mr. Okolesnow said.
The best design film "Pit and his dragon" appeared in the Russian screen.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the charming dragon, the life story and song of the country are enough to re-believe in old-fashioned magic, says ELENA KRAVCUN.
The frightened little girl improved the dragon, becoming a human child and a gentle nurse, and a loyal friend.
Pete's name is his friend Elliot, in honor of a box of stories, playing with him in a trailer and sleeping in a room.
Six years later, he had grown up and in a muddy fold, no longer distinguished from another imaginary forest climber, Maugli.
In this way, Pete finds the red-headed woman Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the Gavin (Karl Urban) brigade, her husband's brother, is aggressively forested.
Now she will have to believe not only in the existence of a dragon but also in helping to save him.
Pete is taking an accelerated course "to be human" in the neighborhood of the idyllic Americans who wear cowboys, the moral code in the heart and smile more blind than in any advertisement.
No person looks or acts too horribly so that the viewer actually begins to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who hunted the untypical inhabitants of his superior forest, far away from uncorrected crime.
A hugely empty dragon has also gained no fear, with a good muddy bulldog, a flying wing, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is fun, muttering, even shaking, and, fortunately, does not say, because he always wants to starve, it is beneficial for him to be different from all the famous cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding hold ensures such a high level of emotional involvement that, at the most tense moments, they are desperate to cry in three arms not only small viewers but also adults.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figli in the role of Pete, which breaks between a possible family and the present.
And Robert Redford is virtually publishing a canonical grandfather who would love to have literally every child.
How did Director David Louri take off a fantastically nice frame of the forgotten movie Dragon Pitt in 1977, mediated from the nose to the end of the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and play movies, and make it the most emotional movie this summer?
Not like a miracle helped.
In his painting, Laurie from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers and most of the weird jokes on board.
This good story reads the drawings drawn from "Bambi", "Inplanetian" and many other nice children's hearts.
Disney's studio continues to expand the 21st century high-quality frame gallery.
Of course, "Pit and Dragon" isn't as spectacular as "The Jungle Book," and there's no experience of the crime that Kate Blanchett has seen in the role of a cat in the new "Woolushka".
But this naive film is no less successful in believing in miracles and good in the best design traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magic lock The Disney director Louri will get another one for the artistic cinema adaptation of the story of Peter Pene.
"Pete and his dragon" by the tandem David Louri and screenwriter Toby Helbrooks entered a new ambitious project on a non-adult boy on James Barry's one-time story.
Journalist RBK Alexander Sokolov has filed a new indictment
Journalists of the RBK Aleksandra Sokolov, accused of organizing the extremist structure, stated that the prosecutor had found loopholes in their case.
The fact that the prosecutor's office made such a statement, we learned from the investigators yesterday.
We had been scheduled to attend a court meeting on the subject of limiting the information on criminal matters, but there was no meeting, and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the prosecutor," explains Dr. Olga Dinze.
She explained that the Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated that the investigators were inconsistencies with the qualifications of the case and the collected material.
The investigators will now have to remove gaps in the evidence base and present Alexander Sokolov with a new indictment.
Either the other article of the Penal Code (UC) will appear, or will remain, but with other evidence and new evidence, Ms. Dinze will clarify.
As reported by "U", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the RBC's indictment the wording of “distorting the political situation towards instability” and “injury of power”.
ALEXANDR ZILBERT, the correspondent of Commersanthoboscosport, experienced the lives of the Olympics in the Olympic Village, inspected the house of the Russian assembly, had lunched in the local table, and even passed the WADA test.
Life doesn't seem to die here for a second.
Even at night.
The last startups are sometimes completed at midnight, after which sportsmen need another half-hour to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, there is no stopping-out and eviction from the village, as some athletes finish their speeches and leave Brazil, and some, on the other hand, only arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations will be drawn to one of the temporary tents.
In these meetings we usually discuss some operational domestic issues - the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team, Igor Izikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which we were located, consider the model one of the first to be put into operation and demonstrated to all the examiners, even in the case of some disadvantages.
It's a hot water problem, so I'm sorry, it's a one-off thing.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinics came in, but they only pop some substance into the sex, yes and everything.
They have fields, do you see any innovations.
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
Let's know these fields are ordinary.
In general, changes have been made to the clanging company and now all OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Boutovo, a bedroom area surrounded by mountains, by impressive oaks and golden waters.
There's still a two-metre rail fence around the perimeter for reliability.
The village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments in 31 houses.
In one of the 18-storey buildings, a huge Russian flag is hung - this house is completely dedicated to our collection.
From the perspective of a small lobby at the entrance, it is possible to identify immediately what problems appear to be the most pressing for the national team.
Two announcements are pending: "Please don't throw a paper in the toilet!" and by hand "Primo in gift badges.
The stasis itself sinks into the loops.
Their fun color contrasts with the headlines of the brochure: "Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro", "First aid in warming, international body in respiratory pathways, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiovascular resuscitation", "First aid in fires, heat strike, fractures and bleeding".
Text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by nausea and subsequent treatment.
However, not all are waiting for a favorable outcome.
Of course, Russia has a medical centre that is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance to residents, including relaxing and sporting massages.
On the contrary, the centre is the headquarters of our delegation.
A line with the door is an inspiring cry, "No matter what we win!"
And, of course, verses:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear (Allah) will believe in it.
Let's keep it down, let's lose the taste of victory, Russia won't fall, it won't break!
And for the further promotion of the spirit, the announcement is: “Brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia Kirilla's spiritual care for the sportsmen of the Russian Olympic Assembly is carried out by the Protestants Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseyev.
You can order a request and other requirements on the phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Operations for All Confessions in the Village.
Well, the Russians, in a privileged position, have their own watch.
With regard to the cargo of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the ladder, which is recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the darkness he met the dead bodies upon it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of a new clanging company.
I believe that at any time they were prepared to drop onto the washing of innovative sex, they decided to set up a quiet time directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with an old acquaintance, Vitalie Fedorovic Dubko, a coach of our batutists, who brought them to the Olympic gold for 16 years back in Sydney.
He and the educator, the champion of Europe, Jan Paul, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
We're sorry for a lot of things, but the impressions of a well-deserved coach in Russia are almost inconceivable, but it's not critical.
Sanselle's one on the fourth, but that's why it's spacious.
Schaff, of course, funny, from the fabric, trust doesn't cause, but things can be put.
"No, you're bluffing, they're done with the tea!" --with the hands of the tennis player, Svetlan Kuznez, who met me at the main table.
It is called the main site, at least because it is 2,7 thousand sq.m. space and is ready to accept 5,000 visitors at the same time.
It's up to 60,000 bucks a day for free.
The options for the menus are: "Beautifuls from Brazil", "Cooks of Peace", "Asian Guards" and "Pietes, Macarones".
The last option, as I looked at, is the popularity of our volleyballists.
And let's say I didn't find any soup in any of the giant restaurants.
What kind of soup?
It's a good thing I took Chinese with me, wild.
And a teapot.
But, you know, we've got worse food in the courts.
There's something you can pick here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I've personally picked a pair of chips and peanuts in a tomato sauce.
There are a number of tables with a name in three languages: English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the food value of the product and the availability of allergens.
Well, to admit it was appropriate.
I don't even know why that's always in local McDonald's.
We can say that “hot” sportsmen on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Oting Agency (WADA).
They're tricking the victor, the winner of the football game.
They're provocative, you can say!
In order to receive a gift, at least eight questions out of ten should be answered correctly.
There's a question in Russian! - I've been attacked by a girl from WADA.
But that's not what it was.
I mean, I got caught in a patriotic break, of course.
The situation has already become acute to the second question: "If I have received notification of doping control, should I immediately go to doping control?"
I said, "No, I've got one hour."
He's lost, so to speak, watchful.
I've forgotten that WADA's weakness is not to be expected.
In general, we need to be right away.
Well, at the seventh stage, my situation became quite critical.
I thought that if I find it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my flat schedule (and I find it difficult!), I can use bio-additionals to get "additional nutrients to enhance my productivity."
No, they don't!
More precisely, the answer is that categorically they do not prohibit, but they insist on, in a number of proposals.
It's not fair to play WADA!
Well, how's it going, Russia?
To retreat somewhere behind Efimova, Isinbaeva and all of our defenseless team.
That's why I focused and I won an accident football last year.
Know what it says, ours!
In a winning mood, I went to the fitness center next door.
Get involved in the coach count.
It's 250.
He was surprised to note that no Russian sportsman was found in this raid of the runaway roads.
But maybe it's right?
Let him who can't play be trained!
And there's one of our guys sitting in a nearby polyclinic.
It's about the eyelid.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In the clinic, however, as well as in the whole village, there's a storage machine hanging out.
And there's an inspiring cry: "Get together with the condom."
The only thing left is to roll the iron that reminds you of the door lock and the condom made from the Amazon's natural latex is to get out of the machine.
I took one, remember.
The athletes won't be able to escape - they've been taken by 450 thousand.
The Olympia village has an entire entertainment centre for holiday and holiday entertainment.
In any case, his anger was marked by a signboard, reminding him that the International Olympic Committee had spent $3.25 million a day on sportsmen in various ways.
The center is equipped with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices like video trainers.
I'm interested in a company in the form of a Ukrainian collection that actively uses a wild game.
I could, of course, just say he doesn't want to talk to a man in the form of a Russian assembly, yes and everything.
Here, in some strange way, they're going to fish in yellow and blue.
It's the most playful collection ever.
It takes not less than three hours to walk around the village, looking into every corner of it.
But, if you're walking, not riding on electricians, you're opening up a house with a Canadian hair collection at the entrance and a closet with a refurbished bathroom, and a ticket office, and a lawn, and a gym, and a parkhouse, and a flower shop, and a box with everyday consumer goods, and a mail with unique brands (only you can't transfer in a row from the Chinese philatelists), and a bank, and a collection desk, and a photocosic.
And late in the evening, you'll be sitting next to an olive tree hanging with various colored strips in mind for those who have left this world, friends and relatives of athletes.
And you're going to be under the combination of a machine that's indistinguishable fluid to kill insects, to think about forever.
It's about the Olympic movement.
That doesn't stop in this village for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was still breathing, it was observed that the Australians had not heard the American Dream Team, the present patients had gone online.
Little one knows: the news that Inna Deriglasza won the gold in the rapier at the XXXI Olympics, I got the first.
Maybe I'm the only muscle that's ever seen how it happened -- not to those who were obviously watching Carioca matches that night.
This can only be understood by the present patient.
Here's the noise of the Moscow night.
Neighbors down - as always in the night - fall asleep and begin to cry out unhappily, but very loudly.
And threatening to drive furniture.
There's no time to go to the market and buy as the plumber asked.
There's nothing in the TV schedule, so he just kept track of the Match, the First, and in any case, Russia -- although it's almost pointless.
Russia is a family of repeats, all sports there for a reason in the records.
It's where the live air series are broadcasting.
Hope, of course, at Match, a young man screamed all night in news releases first about the great semifinal of Deriglas-Shanaev, then about the imminent battle for gold.
It would make sense to show.
But instead, basketball is the U.S.-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They've put in place people who are more of their own size than Americans.
As a result, they have lost, but, as they say, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be an ancient one.
It's all right, but it's close to the fight with the Frenchman, and on the screen without change.
In an easy panic, I start writing channels.
That's the feeling, the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep, on the cables.
There's no one on any of the subject "Matthews" feit.
And, in my opinion, the fight will begin.
I don't like texting and tweeting on some sports sites.
The surrogate provides an unexpected but brilliant result.
The "First" website provides a direct technical transmission of all competitions that are currently taking place.
I'm clicking on a warrant, I'm getting a unit for gold.
Deriglas highly contractate, go forward - and clearly start to take time.
The Italian is playing almost all the fumes.
Our one point forward, to the end we hear more than two seconds.
Di Francisco is thrown into Deriglasz and is retreating, time is running out, the Italian is driving around.
Victory!
In a few seconds, an Olympic messenger on the phone reported the fourth gold medal.
It's coming out, I'm the first one to see it with my own eyes.
Foolish, faithful, involved.
Tatarstan's spiritual administration (DUM) is refusing to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the prisoner of the DUM forced his colleagues to preach Friday only in Tatar to force young Tatars to “recognize their native language”.
The government claims that this is "no harm in any case" to the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani felt that the Tatar language did not understand up to 60 per cent of foreigners, including foreign students, migrants and tatars themselves.
Imams are afraid that their Tatar sermons will “not reach the entire audience.”
Yesterday, DUM Tatarstan's plenary unanimously decided to hold Friday's sermons in the Republic's mosques only in Tatar language.
As Tatarstan Camille Samigullin said, this must be an incentive for young tattoos to “recognise their native language”.
"For those who say it's "hard," in each large mosque we intend to organize the Tatar language lessons absolutely free," promised Mr. Samigulin.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today, in all mosques, the sermons “must be in the Tatar language”.
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan publishes the magazine Shura with typical Tatar sermons.
I've got a guy who doesn't say well enough, "it's gonna be easy to prepare."
DUM Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand incomes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to Muftia, Friday’s sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, the Russian language was mostly used in some mosques in Kazani.
In particular, as Mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Bernau Mosque, Zakaban and Enniller.
However, Mr. Muhamethin stressed, the leadership tasked all students with both national languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"No matter what harm the Muslim netatar may not be," stressed Mr. Muhammetshin, explaining that the preaching itself “is not a binding, fundamental part of the namasa.”
In doing so, the namaz will continue to read in Arabic, lessons and lessons in Russian will remain in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafi Muhamethin said "U," that there was no serious threat of removing the Tatar language from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar languages, such as Uzbek or Tadjik, it is reported that the sermons are not used in the Republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCT).
The head of the U.K.T. Col. Rinat Zakirov said "U" "Mechetti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this area.
He noted that preaching in the Tatar language was only "the desire of the Imams themselves", but in the WCT, they "considered it to be right".
The requested "U" have been preaching in Russian, willing to comply with the DUM decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties with the understanding of the ministers.
In the mosque are tatars and Russians.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course they'll be sad.
"There's got to be a recovery," says I have the Burnaev Mosque of Farhat Maveltdinov.
According to him, preaching in the Russian language is closer even to many tatars, since “Russian in schools and in children, on the radio, where it was originally.”
However, he believed that the mosques would be able to continue lessons and lectures in the Russian language that were held on other days.
We put our trust in God.
God will bring you out of it," he said.
But about 60 percent of us don't know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbek and Tajik and Azerbaijani.
We have many foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," I say.
He believes that in the Tatar language, sermons will “come to a narrower circle and not come to the whole audience.”
But we will be subject to the decision of the plenary.
The result of the preaching work will be different.
But time will show.
"I will, for example, only be easier, because the Tatar language is my native," said Gabdulla Galliullin.
Former Director of the FSIIN
The Moscow Prosecutor ' s Office has passed an indictment on the investigation of the CSU's criminal investigation into the theft of the budget allocated for the purposes of the Russian FSI.
An ex-chief of the Aleksandr Reimer prison department and his deputy, who has caused more than 2.7 billion rubble damage to the FIN, will be brought before the court.
The Civil Prosecutor ' s Office sent a criminal case to the Zamoskovorj court with respect to former Director FSIIN of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikola Krivolapov, as well as Director of FGUP "The Centre for Information and Technology and Communications of the Federal Service for the Enforcement of Penalties" (FGUP CITOS) by Viktor Oderelenova.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused of the SSCH on Moscow under section 3 of the 285 FF (use of heavy-duty authority), section 159 FF (manufacture by using their official status as an organized group, especially large).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged with .1 p.m. 222 CRC (unlawful acquisition and storage of munitions).
According to the SCR version, in 2010-2012, the persons identified by fraud had taken out of the public penalty the budgets allocated to the FSIIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems for the sub-controllers, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal the budget money, the group developed a scheme under which the CITOS FCHP subsidiary, with which the relevant public contracts were concluded, produced control and oversight techniques, including “electronic brochures”, and implemented several times higher prices.
Although CITOS FGUP had no production equipment, buildings, facilities to accommodate the production capacity to create a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", between them and FSIIN Russia had received five gocontrats of more than 3.3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubs have been collected from the Samar branch of the GHF, of which 1.2 billion rubs have been stolen.
As a result, more than 140 million dollars of cash was personally received by Mr. Reymer in his official office from one of the partners in the criminal case for which a separate proceeding was made.
Nikolai Krivolapova, who participated in the machinings, found an unknown origin of the cartridge to the award gun, which allowed him to file an additional charge.
In this case, with a volume of 133 volumes, the FSIN claimed compensation for material damage of 2.7 billion rubles to the accused.
Soccer Hakan Shukure is suspected of taking part in the road.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of the Hakan Sukura parliament and conducted searches in two homes of his family.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, attacked by Hakan Shukuur, is being searched by the country ' s authorities for a coup d'état that took place last month.
Forvard, who completed his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group”.
This is the Hizmet movement, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition to Fethol Gulen.
It was his President Erdogan who was the organizer of the attempt to convert the military that took place on 15 July.
Fetholah Gullen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
Local media reported that an arrest warrant for Hakan Shukur was issued today, and the police have already conducted searches in two homes belonging to the family of the former footballer.
According to the investigation, his father was also involved in the organization of Fathullah Guulen, apart from Hakan Shukuura himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
In the home of a footballer, Hakan Shukuur protected the colours of several Turkish clubs and advocated for the assembly.
He spent most of his career in Galatasara.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torno", "Inter" and "Palarmo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he did not spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukuur remains still the most effective attacker of the Turkish assembly: in his assets 112 match for the national team and 51 killed.
In 2013, Hakan Shukuur left his post due to an initial investigation into corruption around the Erdogogan party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, an order was issued in Turkey on 25 July to arrest at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of promoting the military revolution and the links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethol Gulen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the severity of the charges, media staff can wait for long prison terms from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to create a film theater network only for national films.
"I would create a film theater network exclusively for the Russian cinema, on which tickets stood at 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Conchalovski noted that Russian films were difficult to compete for audiences with large Hollywood strips.
We have over 100 paintings in the country every year, of which there are 20-25 tapes on average.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, in which huge budgets are being made," the film director said.
Remember, 1 July in Crimea began the work of the Tavrid Youth Education Forum of the All-Russian Youth Forum.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian areas from all over Russia and a number of neighbouring and distant countries.

"Today we and the Russian sports minister Vitalie Mutko visited the building, with us was the director of Metrostro, Vadim Alexander.

Vitalie Mutko and I have been quite visible and heard," quoted the interviewer's agency.
In the past, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg to check the venue for the upcoming large competitions.
Mr. Tulpanov also noted that the Soufeda commission would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would visit the building regularly.

Former Deputy Governor Nikolai Sandakow Konstantin Akulic was detained in Miaasse (Chelabean Region).
As U-South Ural reported to another accused lawyer, Sergey Kolosovski, Konstantin Akulic today called on the investigation department of the SCR Miass to file an annual case of beatings.
Then Constantine Akulic went to the scene as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
"It was originally initiated against unestablished persons. Now that he started protecting Nikolai Sandakow, it turned out to be Akulic," says Sergei Kolosovski.
Constantine Akulic became a former deputy governor's lawyer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before a lawyer called on SCR Miassa, the defence party was informed that Monday was due to be informed of the fraud cases in which Nikolai Sandakow was accused.
Recall that two criminal cases have been brought against Nikolai Sandakov.
As part of his first fraud case, he was incriminated by a pledge of 1.5 million rubles to promote the appointment of Mayor Magnitogorska Head of the Lake Evgenia Tarasov Administration.
The second criminal case relates to the bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from CEO Piton Igori Kalugin in the form of an illegal free provision of property services of at least 1.3 million rubles.
Read more about Mr. Sandakov's case in the "U" material "Exterior Vice-Governor requires the merger of his affairs".
The Russian Medieval Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and to focus more on the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK has taken the lead in modernizing one of the oldest and most environmentally "gray" enterprises in the country, the Caribbean mede-floor combination.
The Karabish mede-floor plant was founded by an English shareholder company in the head of Lesley Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was important for the economy of the industrial enterprise, and it actually ensured the viability of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, production was halted because of financial problems, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was taken to resume the work of the Caribbean Mede-Flying Combine.
It was also necessary to address one of the major environmental problems of the Caribbean.
By the early 2000s, Karabash had been known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company was run by the Russian dairy company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This has been noted recently by the Governor of the Chelyabean Region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in early July.
The head of the South Urala called the major changes that have taken place since "Karabashmede" went to the RMK group.
The main event on the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new serosol furnace to catch up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Medieval Company, the investment in the project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the ZAO Karabashmede is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, vacuum cleaners and gas tractors is scheduled at the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubs.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to start a new cleaning process of industrial goods worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, taxes on the city budget of Karabash will also increase.
The federal penalty will be 8.9 billion rubs for the entire duration of the Tominian GOK project - from the start of construction and before the second operation.
Following the introduction of GOCa into operation, the income of taxes at all levels may amount to 80.9 billion rubs.
During the year of production in the Varennes region, there were 346.3 million rubles in budgets.
And this is the first year.
"The more successful the company is, the more the deductions may be," added Valerie Ulanovski.
In the RMC it was stated that in 2015 the tax deductions from the Micheev GOK approached 1 billion rubs.
However, the participation of SMEs in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
The RMC is helping to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and entertainment facilities, and to promote territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian dairy company in Karabash has become capital repairs and, in fact, the almost complete restructuring of the N9 child care facility to 95 educators.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
Also on the territory of RMC Arena arena are located a landscape park with artificial dust, underground and underground parking for 600 machinery, coffee and sports shops.
RMC Arena will provide excellent professional sports activities at the international level.
But the main objective of the project is to make physics and sport comfortable available to the inhabitants of Čelabinska, especially to children.

Staff at the Sandholm Refugee Center in Denmark suspected that adolescents in Denmark were engaged in prostitution.
That's what The Local reports on Thursday, August 11th.
According to him, some adolescents told the staff in the institution that “some in Copenhagen is organizing prostitution”.

WSJ: The United States is considering sanctions against the RF because of the collapse of democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the collapse of the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
The U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is reported to have to be officially accused of attacks on Russian servers or supported by Russian hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other American services are almost convinced of Russia's participation in cybercrime.
WSJ notes that the United States usually prefers not to mention the hackers.
The exception is the entry into the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially entrusted to the PRC in 2014.
However, last year Obama issued an order facilitating the imposition of sanctions on those who implement or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, says the publication.
Even if officials found that the hackers had been operating with the support of Russia, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose information.
They need to determine whether it is so serious to exacerbate bilateral tensions.
It was previously reported that the Barack Obama Administration allowed the use of sanctions against a State whose hackers had been hacked by the Democratic Party ' s Nazi Party.
WikiLeaks has published an electronic copy of the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the explosion.
In Kremlin, such messages were called absurd.
FAS punished Google almost half a billion rubles
There has been a distortion of competition in the mobile applications market.
The anti-monopoly procedure was initiated on the initiative of "Andesa".
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the use of applications from other developers, in particular from "Andesa".
FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position on the market and imposed the installation of mobile devices along with the Google Play store of other applications.
As a result of the verification, the Federal Antitrust Service decided to punish Google, informed FAS leader Alexei Docenko.
The fine shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
In FAS, it was concluded that the Competition Protection Act should respect all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to study the decision first and only then will it be determined by further actions: to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antitrust Service recognized the company as an infringement of the Competition Act in September of last year and ordered that contracts be adjusted by 18 December.
However, Google did not agree.
Since then, the company and the department have been in trial.
In FAS, it was noted that despite the fine, they were discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
Ehu Moscow expressed this view by the leading researcher Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazine also noted that the fine would not affect the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

"Anime" effect Snapchat criticises as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially distasteful.
With the help of the Snapchat tool, about 150 million users can change the reality and play with individuality in ways that limit absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a person to stand up to Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, distorting lines of instruments that create more than 30 million adjusted self-reliances per day.
Any mistakes quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark-haired persons or encouraging white-haired persons as an ideal for beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them hairy eyes, curved teeth, and smelly cheeks, some critics thought it to be racist cartoons on Asians, yellows.
And they asked whether these repeated contradictions indicated a more serious problem for a company related to diversity.
On Wednesday, reports on The Verge and Motherboard were reported and followed by a breakdown in reports on the next day after Snapchat stated that they had removed this function.
The company commented: The lens was designed to respect the characters of an anime, not the caricature of Asians.
But to experts who know about racism without hearing, Linza recalled offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the anime comparison.
In his e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American artist whose photo tweets were actively shared, said that the lens was "suffering and at least impassable".
She added that "it was difficult to argue against the very rough side of the asian caricature and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowing, but to a maximum extent damaging yellowing.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, starting from corporate halls to Hollywood and the waves that we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat, who are more racially diverse than their older generation, can mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses created an image that was offensive to the user, she said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Kathi Ju, "that's how things are going to be much more difficult to stay undetected, as it was before."
On Thursday, Ju, a product manager and an engineer working on the Medium, decided to remove his recording in Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In the article for the Medium and in the telephone interview, she said that racial contradictions were due to insufficient diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snepchat.
Ju criticised the predominantly white leadership of the company, consisting only of men and ended up with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Jou, who is himself an American of Chinese origin, wrote: "They do not have enough white people in their state to make such decisions, or they do not have white people, but they do not hold positions that can be safely and openly expressed."
Other observers share her view, expressing dissatisfaction with Snapchat not answering most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, according to a trusted person, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on insufficiently represented populations and on active attempts to engage in domestic resources.
For his part, Ju said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that they won't do that."
The military leadership violated IGIL intelligence, reports the congressional commission
Officials of the U.S. Armed Forces Central Command have amended intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than on the ground of developments on the ground, the Congress Commission reported on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Presidents of the Committee of the Chambers of the VP, the Committee on Intelligence and the Sub-Committee on Military Appropriations, found “wide-ranging dissatisfaction” among the Central Command intelligence analysts who claimed that the leaders had undermined their assessment of American actions aimed at winning over the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military administration in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The research documents confirmed by Centcom's High Command generally gave a more optimistic picture of US anti-terrorism action than is confirmed by actual data from the scene, and were stablely optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services," the report said.
"What has happened in Centcoma is unacceptable: when the supreme leadership seems uncertain, our military suffers," said a member of the Chamber of Representatives Ken Calvert, a Republic of California.
The problems of leadership in Centcom are the highest in the organization.
The ten-sided report explains in detail the shortcomings that continued to arise in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training Iraq ' s armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that members of Obama ' s management have ordered the falsification of the reports, he argues that analysts felt that Centcom ' s leadership forces them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as the IGIL or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than actual events," the report reported.
For example, an officer of Centcoma publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at returning to Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is probably known," said a member of the House of Representatives Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Command's highest intelligence management has been subscribing command intelligence documents to reduce the IGIL threat in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they found out that the analysts expressed concern that the Islamic State had been informed of the falsifications.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday follows more up-to-date data.
An additional unresolved investigation by the reconnaissance of Centcom is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the U.S. Congress Chamber of Intelligence Committee published their own data on Thursday, which are consistent with some of the findings of the Republican operational group.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centco has established an excessive closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments on Iraq's IGIL and security forces," claims a member of the Chamber of Representatives Adam B. Shiff, the lead representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, according to Shifa, "has halted the issuance of intelligence documents", has damaged the morale of analysts and "is insufficient to reflect the dispersal views".
But Shiff and the Democrats claim that there was no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom's analysts to raise their conclusions under the “tasked or political interpretation”.
The preliminary results of the Congress' investigation were presented in Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, which was opened after the complaints of the Centcoma analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the congress until the Chief Inspector's investigation continued.
But he said that “experts sometimes spend their time in the processing of integrated data, and the Special Services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues relating to national security”.
The consequences of the investigation are beyond the scope of whether the goals of the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence is now increasingly claiming).
But last year's statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true military assessments in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence repeats disputes over ten years ago when an analyst for Centcoma Gregory Hucker wrote a research article that claimed that President George Walker Bush's administration, due to a protest, had supported a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought about what followed the 2003 invasion.
Hacker also played a key role in the protest caused by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Hukera team concluded that despite public declarations of the reverse, the oil pipelines belonging to the Islamic State did not significantly deteriorate the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil pipelines to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not spread outside the Central Command, as reported in September of the Times.
The then Commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after the witness testimony in the Senate, which many Members considered to be too optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S.A. has won four rounds of women ' s hockey on grass, thus approaching the decisive catch with Britain
Killing once three goals in a match that ended the victory over Japan with a 6-1 account, Katie Bem opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the US women's strike team on the grass when the Americans won a victory over India's 3-0.
Five heads in two games must be a memorable achievement, but Bem, 27 years of age, says she's not sure if she would ever do anything like that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm really not one of those people who follow their goals.
This is what she knows: the American 4-0 account in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their team with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan loses its 2-0 account on Thursday.
The British and US teams will meet on Saturday in the last round.
Both teams apply to the four finals, and the outcome of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams and who will.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong team of opponents from the Netherlands, the leaders of the other group, in a bit of a while when the four-final games begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise of their unexpected series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in London.
Bem was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, when she was 3 years old, and joined the 16-year-old National Assembly, and became her youngest in history.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008, when she did not go through the final round.
Then came 2012 when she and her teammate did not have everything to do with it.
The next year, Coyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed a coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bem.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bem opened the account in the first half of the game with a brush with an uncomfortable hand for a short distance.
India went to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team was surprised and kept account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bem took the initiative in his hands.
She took a long walk with a ball down the left side of the field, then went into the middle of the spiral and ran a ball straight to the door, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzales added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" win was the first at the U.S. doorman's tournament, Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
So is Bem.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how well it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the nobility of the Olympic Games - "day" of bees on the bat
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro appear to be unchanging and inevitable, a combination of competition and aspirations.
It's the Olympic fire itself, and there's the hot façade that's going from the ship to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors' conversations in coffee, and not hear about Simone Bails, Katie Ledeca, or the hostility between Michael Felps and Chad de Clo.
And there's still Logan Duley.
Duly, for the first time participating in the Olympic Games, a beautiful with hammocks on the cheeks, could be among the celebrities shown in the premieres promoted by sponsors and life-threatening advertising roles, if he was a sailor, a gymnast or even a festive.
But 28-year-old Duli from Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in Olympic matches on the bat.
The Olympics don't highlight all the events the same.
In addition to the centre, partly in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, tekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long kingdom.
But if I'm allowed to speak up for my personal passion, allow me to draw your attention to the modest promise of the bees on the boat.
Although battalions have been an Olympic type of sport since 2000, when they competed in Sydney for the past 16 years, they have received so little recognition that many people who have been questioned by me have not been aware that they are in general the Olympic type of sport.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won medals in battalions and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually share male awards, while Chinese and Canadians are female.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the boots on the boot have the charm of an outsider, especially because for an uneducated ear they are more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a ground-based enthusiasm.
Indeed, they have a comical potential — a caricature of endless bees — but also the presence of gymnastics and bees in water, two types of sports that they mostly combine in themselves.
The word "bhutt" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "tramplin for springs in water."
The candidates for the victory are on a giant battalion, flying almost 30 feet in the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, swings, and salt) until the final landing on the foot.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and “flight times”, according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two sportsmen from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will meet in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is ahead.
Medal applicants must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, over there in the field.
They seek not only the final drawing or the starting wall, but also, like a telecamera, the other daring edge: the world record or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatical — and it is enough to make even the viewer pass through.
But it, in my opinion, is getting a little tired when you look at the game.
He's got the boots on his boot.
The batutist's direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, looks like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then no effort up again.
And of course, they don't run without competition or difficulty, but there's no crazy turn to finish throughout the program, there's no sparks in length, only a strange, clear disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest to the day of the Olympic sport.
Women ' s qualification contests and then the final will take place on Friday, the day-to-day broadcast in Eastern Europe; men on Saturday, also on the hour.
NBC will transmit the finals under the agenda from 14:00 a.m. to both days.
In the course of the Olympic Consciousness, there is a peaceful, beautiful moment that can be easily seen in the common dump.
And if there is only a growing awareness of male sportsmen driven by views and objectivization, as Wall Street Journal has recently suggested, the United States gymnasts, Duli is just waiting for her new amazing crowd of fans.
The Protest Generation in Ethiopia, a former US ally
Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the Government.
The witnesses say that dozens of protestors were killed in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of collapse?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months anti-governmental protests have shaken the country, spreading to more and more of its territories.
Only in the last week did thousands of people go to the streets, requiring radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was cruel.
The witnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video recordings from the protests reportedly taken at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Official on Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Rog project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated African country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations constantly referred to governmental repression - opposition in the territory of the State was interrupted by the fact that dissidents had actually been forced to shut up.
Many of them were imprisoned, imprisoned, killed or expelled in remote deserts.
But that can change.
"If people keep pushing and leaving other options other than protesting, there will be a rise," said Seium Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation protests.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the Government Coalition.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the Government party and its allies fully opposed the opposition and are now controlling 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea grow; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has taken hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts are afraid that separatist groups, which have been destroyed more or less in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, may try to use the waves and overarm themselves.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings of a few years of insomnia in the depths of the soul are now raging.
First, it would seem completely harmless: smartphones.
In just the past few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become round, and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through the proxy server that they hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was the way they were organized for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from the predominantly Christian high mountain areas of Ethiopia has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in low areas.
But that also changes.
"We will act together under one start," said Mulat Hamec, leader Oromo.
Major protests took place in the areas of Amharic and Oromo.
Many of the Amharic and Oromo feel that the Ethiopians are unfairly dominated by members of the Tigris ethnic group, which is around 6 per cent of the population, which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have predicted danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly experienced in identifying the first signs of dissatisfaction and using investigators to obtain data and dissipate opponents.
"The current regime is not sound enough," said Abdi, an analyst for conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemariam Desalen, appeared and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tigris region in northern Ethiopia, Hylemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say that it does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that this will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia had experienced such concerns in 2005, after thousands of people had protested that, as analysts have said, it was likely that the government had chosen and then submitted results.
During the subsequent repressions, many Protestants were killed, although at a lower rate than in recent months, and this period of riots was relatively fast.
The development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia ' s leaders for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as a new inter-urban train and significant success in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this did not stop the growth of domestic dissatisfaction by the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month the protests in Honduras, the city of Amharic, attacked enterprises belonging to Tigray, and anti-Tigrian hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the protestors make the United States and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The US Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And it's gonna be hard to get through this stuffed chain," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IGIL was founded by Obama, "sarkasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict involving his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when several times this week he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions regarding the ability of the candidate to be president of the Republican Party to address the American people wisely.
It also put his successors, who tried to protect him during a period of trouble, into an awkward situation, because they had to explain the statements that he probably did not mean.
In expressing this assumption on Wednesday night, Trump insisted firmly on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton had founded IGIL.
But at the post office on Twitter early in the morning of Friday, Trump wrote that he was just e-mailing.
This post was a direct contradiction of the claim made only a day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his indictment.
When a radio-conserver, Hugh Hewitt, tried to help Trump to ease his speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the candidate for the president of the Republican Party did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal erupted when Trump tried to redirect his campaign to the economy in the face of a decline in ratings.
Trump and Clinton spoke with competing economics in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
Once again, he turned to Twitter, warned that Clinton's plans would lead to a tax increase, and said it was boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he had come up with a general criticism, almost expressing the idea that the Russian should break Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "I'm kidding at last."
This approach allows the Trump to go beyond what is allowed in political terms and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages that are responding to his worshipers to see how they work and then "explain them on the other side, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, an expert on communication, analysing the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is careful in his statements and knows that they are smack enough to treat them differently.
Instead of making speeches for a large electorate, Trump has taken even more vulnerable tone in the last few days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump is entering Clinton with a big ride to North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and going to Florida with her.
Although Trump is usually trying not to apologize for the provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and of not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the object of increased attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his faithful allies in an awkward position: they must publicly support him, whatever the provocations were.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most well-known Deputy Trump, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," Juliani said when he was asked about the authenticity of the Tramp's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true that by Obama IGIL was almost unknown to a small organization, he called it a non-hazardous threat, absolutely unjust, and that is why everything happened because he had taken the army out of Iraq.
Most of the medium-sized Republicans are convinced that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as the Secretary of State, has allowed IGI to develop, as it was unable to cope with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to a meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack on Twitter for the media for each of his words and foresight against him.
He joked about the poor television experts who were trying to figure him out, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some of the democracies ridiculed the Thramp's excuses as a further confirmation that it was not due to the presidents.
Once the distilled caffeine returns to Greenpoint
The "Verb" cafe was spread, only taking place in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but had a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pulled out of her window room at Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sherry shop, which took place in the summer of 2014, deals with the sale of soap in the form of cakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the refreshing city.
The artist Molly Krabapl wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The Verb Caffeine was reborn last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
In the new Verbe there are Wi-Fi and credit cards, but there are some same staff and a simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The head of the new "Verba" is Sisko Rodríguez, a former officer of the old caffeine, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to propose it in a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, who was 36 years old, left a lot in his former form.
"Verb" works with the same bee distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even contains the old "Verba" samples.
But Rodríguez said he would also like to experiment.
He proposed new candles.
The menu contains bacon, eggs and cheese sandwiches and there is a capper topping or a burning bow.
There's a guard of a stormy character.
There's no beer in the coffee, but now fresh juices are being prepared.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the constant flow of old customers.
"Many of the former customers also paid prices from Williamsberg," he said.
In one recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Olivier, who lived in Williamsberg earlier in his 34th year, often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the lockdown, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and atmosphere that impressed me at the Verbe," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, even though on that day instead of the usual ice-coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosental, another former client, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same thing.
"At fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, like hours, I came, and prepared my bee with butter and all manners," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduce new guards into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making an ordinary order, but at some point he's changing something with the help of a bacon, egg or cheese on the bee with all the ways.
Rodriguez said he was not offended that the mill shop once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to make special soap for Verba, using coffee made in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their proposal," Rodriguez said.
The permanent inhabitants of the Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this caffeine.
One of these new customers moved the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the autumn to make his new neighbors feel desirable.
The new place has other benefits.
The local point for sale of juices plans to pour in bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a likelihood that the caffeine will join the next building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes.
Joseph Whitt was a constant client and shared that he was killed in the heat when they closed up.
When the coffee shop opened up in a new place, Whitt said that when he came in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive Eating of Depression in "Slott Trapezy"
In March 1933, shortly after the President's resignation, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was invited to dinner at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashion fairs of the Fifth Avenue, such as the Fua-gra and the Maryland Chef soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: fried eggs in tomato sauce, potato powder and dessert pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Kou, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
Women living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in food history.
The last book of Koua, "Rago of China", was about the Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a single apartment in the Lower East Side through food in his book "House 97 on the Street of Fruit Garden".
Their new joint work on the "Silver Trade," which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
In some degree of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny snack shop in the Flettaron Quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of the Birže crash.
Zigelman, 54, ordered sleek cheese and butterboard with olive pieces, while Kou, 57, took Indian, potato powder and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered it an appropriate starting point for a discussion about food in the days of the Depression.
"Roulettes used a lot of demand," said Zigelman.
There was an arachhisus roulette, a liver roulette, a boob roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine that you ate as much peanuts as you needed for dinner.
Who's dead.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women's groups prepared for farm workers, and freshly cooked pies were served in the morning, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. The "scarlet trapeze" describes how the country dealt with the fact that it suddenly ceased to be the country of abundance.
"It was the time when food became a central, uneasy topic for Americans," Kou explained why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, the new budgetary framework was uneasy: puzzles, such as rollers and creases, became the main food products; squeezing is a "pretty way to make a difference," Zigelman noted, as the poisons could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sous.
Fresh fruits were replaced by more expensive dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the backbone of American food for many years, has become an economical source of shine.
People have been experimenting with strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary health.
By studying the book, which includes recipes, Zigelman has prepared the watch of that era: a sealed bow, painted with peanut butter.
"This addition to the lunch table was not successful," Kou said.
Zigelman added, "That was really weird."
Archaeological oil does not belong to a fiery furnace.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
As never before and ever since, housekeepers — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Housing from 1923 to 1943 — managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgets”, to accept challenges, and to convert the burd into some kind of prodigious spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
It's the oldest of interesting historical facts.
The government's response to starving citizens, for example, is particularly pitiful, because of the position of President Herbert Guver in the spirit of "let the pirogues eat".
Publicly carrying the simple farm scrap of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he was fed as a dim millionaire who became.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, fish with grape juice," Kou said.
He was almost in a gold table, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically decapitated by reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to give an example of his own stomach.
As mentioned in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was totally not interested in taste, and this led to the White House "not only using the most consumed food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared."
Many of the culinary receptions of the period of the Depression were forgotten as soon as the country again stood on its feet.
Their heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Zigelman, and how science has been used in food preparation.
The wives tell us that during the writing of the book, they were better aware of the eating habits of the mother of Zigelman — that she could not eat, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about eating," Kou said.
Siegelman remembers, "She poisoned people in a lot."
There was an unpleasant case of propitulants.
When the tarels in Eisenberg's were released, they and Ko had a dessert that they prepared at home: a dessert made from black and white, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a blackfish," said Zigelman, adding that it was a widespread reception -- to give humble recipes a number of names.
There was not only a bluish, a little bit of pain, sugar, water, and cover.
All unsolicitedly loaded the bed in a narrow, brown, lipid.
To my surprise, it was not bad.
I've asked for extras twice.
With the voice of a trusted budgeter, he said to his wife, "There would be no disturbance to the small-brown Greek nuts here."
The arrest of figures on the mass-drake case in the Havana Basin extended until 14 November
By 14 November, the Court of First Instance had left the case under the arrest of figures on the mass-drake in Havana Bay, in response to an application for an investigation.
In the case of the accused, there are 14 persons.
Let us recall that on 14 May, a massive battle took place at the Havana Basilica of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus, using weapons that killed three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Juri Chabueva and the lawyer, the founder of the public organization Health Nation, Alexander Bocharnik, was charged with murder.
The issue of the second pension index for 2016 can be resolved within the next two or three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-Chairman of the Government of RF, Olga Golodec, informed of this during a visit to the region of Bryan.
We have specific parameters to increase the pension to mitigate the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
The economists are now undermining the results of the mid-year, and we will finish this work in the next two or three weeks," says the hunger strike Interfax.
Commenting on the proposed chapter of the Centre for Strategic Development by Alexei Kudrin, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the topic was not addressed in the cab.
At the end of July, it was known that the Government had agreed on the position on the full index of pension payments in 2017.
The stone and the Grigoriyan went to the finals of the small-calibre shooting matches.
Russian sportsmen Sergei Kamenski and Kirill Grigoriyan went to the finals of the small-calibre shootings from the Olympics in Brazil.
According to the TASS, Sergei Kamensky picked 629 balls and took the first place is a new Olympic record of qualifications.
Cyril Grigoriyan became the second - 628.9 was.
There were eight best athletes in the finals.
The stone is a world record in this discipline (633).
Turkey's opposition to the Fathlah Guilen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
"I require the independent international commission to carry out an investigation into the attempted coup d'état," says the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also said, "If any of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gullen refused to participate in the coup, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Guulen.
Recall that the attempt to convert the military took place in Turkey on the night of 15-16 July.
Gilead companies reimbursed the costs of legal services during a patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to receive reimbursement of the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with the issue of the patent for hepatitis C with Merck & Co Inc drug manufacturer, the Federal District Judge has decided.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in damages for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the US judge detected several violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other non-ethical actions.
In court on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Lebson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to reimburse the costs incurred in the dispute.
Merck is trying to kill Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck were brought before each other in court, stating their rights to laboratory work based on sophosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead medicine.
Armed forces, supported by the United States, claim to have taken full control of Manbij in the Islamic State
The armed forces formed with the support of the United States took full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic fighters left, the group representative reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city after the remaining group of fighters who have been hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were held by the fighters, told Reuters Sharfan Darvis of the Manbij military council's alliance with the SDS.
"The state is now fully under our control, but we are carrying out cleanup operations," he told the Reuters agency.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax
Hillary Clinton announced his 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the candidate for the presidents of the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charity contributions, mainly in the Clinton Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton received approximately $5.3 million in speech fees, and the former Secretary of State declared income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her stay in the State Department.
The potential Vice-President Clinton, US Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, together with his wife, Anna Holton, issued ten-year tax returns.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"The Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to establish a standard of financial transparency," said Clinton Palmmieri, a pre-election advisor.
In full opposition, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and violates his past pledges to publish his tax returns.
It is a common case for candidates in the United States presidents to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the State Tax Service verification as a reason for his refusal to publish his tax declarations.
"Your move," wrote Twitter's pre-election advisor Clinton Jan Sams, referring to the declaration of a candidate from a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trampa Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow the Tromp to release them until the checks were completed.
The criticisms of Trump, including the candidate for the presidents of the Republican Party in 2012 by Mitta Romni and other members of the Republicans, said that his refusal raised questions about his status, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other links, including with Russia.
Clinton caught up with the issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on issuing Republicans who convinced Trump to report tax.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the economics in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the presidents for ten years: publish his tax declarations," she said to the assembled.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid any taxes for nearly two years in the 1990s, and the business suspect of the New York Times on Friday had quoted many tax lawyers and accountants who believed that things might still exist.
Federal tax rates have been the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule called the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people who received more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was afraid not of the tax collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost savings fund, and Clinton reported dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmental struggles in Tanzania have used a non-traditional way to prevent elephants from landing in human settlements, leaving condoms filled with dusty chili.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind several years ago, with the American Nature Protection Committee, took up its promotion by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step, way of protecting their homes and crops, without harming animals.
In the past, many have used a copy to protect themselves.
On Friday will be the World Day of elephants dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we have invented a set of instruments ..., we have seen a change in the relationship within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will not be able to leave elephants on their fields without harming elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell, executive director.
The first two steps are the burning of the faeces before the breaking edge of the elephant and the giving of signals through the horn.
If he couldn't escape, they'd throw away the so-called cloud of chili.
The dust of the chili mixed with the soil is placed with the pump in the reservoir, and the end of it is rolled, and only the phyll remains outside.
When the condoms are burned, they are burned with a vortex, where the small powder is poured into the air.
One dunes is usually enough to turn the elephants on the other side.
The ultimate measure is the launch device that shoots the Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country after the attempted coup in July of this year.
Such data was brought by the head of the media of Turkey, Mewlut Chavuschoglu, in a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we called 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
32 of them have not returned without objective reasons and explanation," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Let us recall that in July Turkey a attempt was made to convert the State.
The authorities officially stated that the coup had failed and reported that more than six thousand persons had been detained, including military high-level and middle-ranking.
As a result of the attempted coup, 290 people were killed, according to the media of Turkey.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing Israel's telephone code for "asking" Arabs – reported channel RT News
The French director of Jewish origin opened the media scandal and found that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code, with officials referring to the "requests" of Arab clients.
Claude Lansman, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoa, expressed his dissatisfaction with Kempinski Bristol in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lansman Hotel, he tried to find Israel in the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among States where direct calls could be made from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel was excluded and eliminated?
He wrote Lanceman.
In exchange for Kempinski Bristol, it provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In seeking an explanation, the director raised the issue at the level of the hotel administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lanceman, was "shocked him."
Clark Hotel said that the measure was "a deliberate solution to Kempinski's network management."
The reason behind this step has led to even greater anger on the part of the director.
"Most of our Arab guests, and they demanded that Israel's code be removed," he said, according to Lancman, who served at the hotel.
The Israeli Ambassador Jacob Hadas-Handelsman called the case "a terrible sight," reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible sight.
What happened in Germany, and that's what happened in this network of expatriates, is even more obvious.
There's no need to explain here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the officer said.
The incident caused a slight resonance on the Internet; it was called a scandal.
Some have claimed that Kempinski simply "goed on" with the alleged requirements of Arab customers.
"We would be ashamed," another post said, stating that the hotel located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street is close to the icon.
The hotel itself has hurried the removal of any charges, calling them "inspection" and "excusing" in front of Lanceman, reports the Der Spiegel newspaper.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the fast-track list," quoted the representative of the Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and resin bullets against Protestant Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday to protest against government reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and tear bullets against the protestors.
The riots began when police officers tried to excite the students, which resulted in the use of jet guns and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concerns about plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 state secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some of the parties to the protest could be seen writing on the graffiti walls against the temporary Acting President Michael Temer.
The last protest took place only a few days after the protesters came out to support President Dilmu Rusef, who was removed when the Senate voted for her influence.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% — reported RT Business portal
With severe sanctions, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to the Ambassador of Russia to Iran, Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest by Russian firms in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing their contacts with Iran, and new companies are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission to Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mainly to tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time Iran entered top-20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
You can say with confidence that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jez, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to twist its cracks into the defence-industrial complex.
The reasons for the dismissal were the "systematic failure" of the General Manager of Almaz - Antey, "labour" and "loss of confidence".
The leader of NGOs has been appointed Gennadius Benderski for the next three years.
Disengagement information appeared only on Thursday night and did not produce a broad media reasoning.
What would explain such a silence in the context of the large-scale rearming of the army?
Most likely, the RF leadership does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This further confirms that the defence industry complex (OPC) has many problems and the State does not want to attract greater attention from society.
The removal of the Non-Aligned is certainly an important development in terms of ordering in the industry.
Almaz NGOs are the main business of the concert, which specializes in the production of marine and ground-based missile complexes.
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of Polyment Redout and Morpheus CFCs, which are planned to be installed on new curves, frigates, esminates and crustaceans.
The founder of the Military Russia Portal Dmitry Cornev believes that the Non-School discharge is due to a break in time for the projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morphea began in 2007, and the construction was expected in 2013.
"Polyment Redout" must be the main WFP system on the new WFP ships.
According to the information I receive, for a few years no actual successful test has been carried out.
True, as far as I can judge, there's no obvious fault in Almaza," said Cornev.
The expert is afraid that a delay in operation may also occur with the C-500 CFC.
The design expertise has not yet been completed, but in 2016 the first complexes must enter the military.
In Minowan, they assure that “the work is being done in a planned manner and will all be completed in due time”, although in 2014, the department recognized that there were problems with the development of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Necorodov, who has been leading the Almaz since 2011.
Cornev noted that the project deadlines could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information on internal processes in OPCA and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large money, as you know, loves silence.
As a rule, the Director of the Defence Companies is either of their own accord, of the agreement of the parties or of their transfer to another work.
In this case, the removal took place in public, even though it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the leader of Almaza was perhaps a strict figure and was opposed to the lower top of the order.
In all likelihood, the State is no longer willing to take such action.
It will remove those who prefer to dispute with Mino-Defend and do not carry out the tasks assigned to them by shareholders.
At the same time, RF's leadership is trying to punish the alleged managers (starship machinery).
Improved attention is given to the issues of the sector by the President himself.
Vladimir Putin chaired the Military Industrial Commission and held periodic rearm meetings.
The Kremlin protects a number of OPC managers, seeking to have a loyal member of directors who will comply with the orders received above.
This is a far-off policy, but there are no other instruments available to the State in the face of corruption and lack of normal competition in the OPC.
The situation in defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces in as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of managers in the OPC, the RF leadership is taking very successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The Army's staff acquired a new quality with the position of Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu.
It's hard to believe that the president has taken up a famous proverb, "You want peace to be ready for war."
During the cold war, the military strength of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which has secured the influence of the continent in Moscow.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, she worked very well.
The lack of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East have been evidenced.
The "winners" trade in the cold war resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", there is no peaceful corner left.
Despite the overall disaster, the West refuses to speak with Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under such circumstances, our country's only allies remain the fleet and the army.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to defend national interests more effectively and to move to new world policies.
Shotlander Kallum Skinner fights on the finish line, which results in British capture of bicycle gold.
Shotlander Kallum Skinner was seeking a triumph in the male commando spirit in Rio last night, thus protecting the British commando trio from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glazgo was the strongest friend of his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoe did his own, and the young man was proud to go into history, wandering in the finish line to win a favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, when Hoi declared the right to the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they've repeated the trick, after they've done the modest sixths at the March World Championship on Third Bikes in London, despite Hoy's career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of a specialist from Jamie Staff.
They did it just once when the Hindus appeared.
The care of Hoa also created the emptiness that Keian Emmadi and Matt Krampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindus, Kenny, and Hoi champions four years ago, and Skinner set up an Olympic record in qualifications, but the rules were passed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change in the strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindus went on a larger transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, to hold Skinner fast.
She watched from her seat as an invited BBC expert and took the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindus when they entered the gym.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgo said, "This is a spring comparison."
I'm here to do everything possible and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record at the final and won the world championships.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoe, Hindus deliberately fell on track after a failed start.
He later denied the comment, and there was no way to appeal by UK competitors.
There was no such issue this time in the greatest victory.
Hindus said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags at the tribunal."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We played so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven out of 10 goals in both Beijing and London.
If it is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then there are five more days of success.
In the form shown by Kenny, it is not beyond the opportunity to imagine, as he repeats the Hoa, winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would show how Kenny, who is 12 years younger than Hoa, who was also born on March 23rd (it seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgray, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), brings his account to six gold medals and one silver one.
It would have been like Hoa.
The next time, Kenny competes in a spirit that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old leaving Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it right now.
The competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's not easy to beat each other, if it's fair.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he'll have to win a knight."
It was the only one for the medal day, but it was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Berk and Owen Doll are the fastest four-kilometre chase race in four.
They ended up at 3:51,943.
The world record established in London for the 2012 gold win is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 evening) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be exactly the focus.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, prior to the qualifying train, when officials required him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women ' s event, which is resumed and completed tomorrow, Laura Troott, Joanna Roussel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavi have improved the world record, showing the time of 4:13,260.
The UK team has come to rely on a potential bicycle team to take possession of the medium-term Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After the truly outstanding demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the second place, not least the departure from the post of technical director Shein Satton in April due to charges of sexism and harassment, and the departures of major figures, such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the race for the first evening on the wheel, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now appears to be reaching peaks at the right time, perhaps once again.
Future of the Portland Metallurgical Plant under threat due to the breakdown of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium plant in Victoria, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant ' s owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This step is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be under threat at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can occur in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical plant in Point Henry, leading to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
Alcoa's Portland Metallurgical Plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions have resulted in reflections about the future of a plant that has continued for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later due to the price of the plant.
The AGL company, which provides large aluminium power plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Walli, reported that it expects other three owners to also take steps to break the treaty.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, while the CITIC Chinese company and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have fewer shares.
"The AGL company expects the Portland facility to continue working, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not end," she said.
According to the company AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called hedging contracts that were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month separation period, so they actually end in 2017.
“Respectively, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of revenue in the financial year 2017,” said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on AGL's income from the financial year 2018 to date is limited by the forecast for a strong future market for electricity prices.
The company AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in terms of “future dissolution”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metallurgical plant or to provide electricity to a metallurgical plant”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had broken the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, the Chief of Operational Service of AGL Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago is about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not just the real star of Cardassian show, Kendall on the cover of the September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, a 20-year-old model, and the fourth daughter of Clan Cardassian-Jenner, mother-manager Chris, appeared on the led September cover of the U.S. Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is a brand of Estee Lauder and defiling fashion in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and cried," wrote Kendall.
The news of the bet was accompanied by strange (or simply by the spirit of the Cardassian Family?), a video reality in which the entire family of Cardassian-Jenner (Debosher Rob and Caitlin, also joined the most popular show-making uncle, the family of Cardassian, Ryan Sikrest), forgot about the sister's appearance on the bet, and at the end of the classic turn: they planned a party-surprise.
It's a standard subject line for almost all children's television shows dedicated to birthdays (Sikret says, "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of the multiple rabbit from the program on 8 a.m.), but Chris needed to get this fame to other girls anyway.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September Vogue, we have no doubt entered the new Kardashian show.
She left her older sister Kendall Kim on the cover of Vogue earlier (she showed up with her husband, Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine was the achievement of itself.
September is the most sold Vogue issue per year.
It is more like a gift - giving edition than a fashion magazine that attracts a huge number of advertisements (according to Fassionist portal estimates, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertisements).
News of who would come from the stars is expected to be so impatient that in the last two years, photographs of the magazine have been merged into official anonymity.
Among the previous women who had fallen into a trap are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have, of course, been more "familiarities working in models" than "familiar models".
The Oscar Prize winner and the brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the bet in 2013, a year after the honour of Lady Gage came out.
But even in the unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as the "extensive model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a bad company.
These celebrities are not family members of known people, reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (though Jenner falls into all these categories).
They are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Baionse, who appeared last year on the cover, this year was one of the most successful in her careers in the issue of the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all good luck, Jenner.
The situation of Jenner in the world of fashion, because of her last TV reality star, has always had to be a joke.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gidji Hadid called them "the battles of the moment."
These moods were once again disturbed after the news of the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue bet.
But it doesn't make any sense to be insatiable.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue.
It is a supermodel in all the sense of that word.
She's defiling Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a ton cream from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling their photos to you in their own applications available on payroll.
She sells her own photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter in Love magazine.
And at free time, she may still be seeing her sister Cortney and her children on television.
Public legal centres refuse to provide 160,000 persons a year
Each year more than 160,000 least-protected representatives of the population refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will result in a further cut in funding for and so on.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly older, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to fight unfair property deprivation and so on — have already been denied seeking free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services that are already outside the scope of their capabilities are preparing for further reductions.
As of June next year, these legal centres should lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Public Legal Centres of Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have been denied a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not cancelled, the situation would only worsen.
"The public legal centres in Queensland are constantly receiving insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who are forced out of a relationship have problems of a legal nature, and this account shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, meaning that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will be forced to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to cancel these reductions immediately so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the Government had fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal assistance to the country ' s average.
Now is the time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palaczuk's time to engage in this important work.
Donald Trampa was put to trial at the pre-election headquarters after the officer allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to New York reports, Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was brought to court: it is alleged that the headquarters did not do anything after the announcement that his Operational Director in North Carolina threatened a staff member with a gun when they were riding in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court case filed in the court of the state in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former programmable trainer in the pre-election state headquarters.
Bordini said he'd waited a few months to solve the problem internally, but he realized that it wouldn't happen.
Director Earl Phillip "takes out a gun, puts his right index finger on his leg and puts a doll on Vincent's knee," says Bordini in a complaint.
Upon complaint to the local and regional pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that, at least four more persons had become participants in similar incidents with Phillip, it was accepted.
"We don't have to shoot guns to cause damage," Bordini said in a complaint.
The demand took place only two days after the Presidents of the Republican Party made a fuhror, he told the North Carolina audience that "the people of the Second Amendment" — known as the owners of weapons and its lovers — could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
Trampa pre-election headquarters said that the media had removed his words from the context and that he had not spoken in support of violence.
In his complaint Bordini called for compensation from the pre-election headquarters for non-cooperative control, and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, abuse and moral damage.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks is slowing down in response to the request to comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip was not a success.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the polling station.
In response to the call to his consulting firm, the Innovation Consulting Services, no one called quickly.
The candidate for presidents from the Republican Party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg District Court (Charlott).
Britain must put the spirit of the Olympics in the right order and expand the Heathrow
It will also bring refreshment and prosperity not only in our present settlements and in general throughout London, but throughout the country.
I think it was the huge advantage of Hytro, just as it was with London in 2012, where we made every effort to benefit our people and regions from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we're going to do that again, creating opportunities for locals and a firm next to Hytro.
We will create 10,000 new traineeships, 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London in 2012, those who believe that the challenge of the expansion of Hitro would be too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics failed in 2012, and they will be proved wrong about Hytro.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hytro answers any question about him.
Like the Winter Olympics, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a wonderful team in Heathrow, which has implemented a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5 to the best five-year airport terminal, to T2, built in the middle of two of the world's most busy airfields.
They are now ready to provide the third flight crew, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for Britain, and I am sure that the expansion of Hytro will also be.
It is time for us to send the Olympic spirit to the right move and to expand the Hitrous, to secure our trade future and to create the legacy of skills and employment that Britain will be able to boast about.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Hytro Council and former Trade Attash of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays in "bitch-mouses" on the issue of blocking advertising
For companies that make money on the Internet, attempting to turn off software to block advertisements is a game in the "cows", according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block the advertising blockers on their desktop version, Adblock Plus posted a blog that users could update their filters into the program to block the advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site is changing the edge of its advertising to make it more difficult for blockers to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims he was able to bypass a new code.
In his blog post, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "a kind of mutual struggle between the community of blockers with an open source code and those trying to circumvent it continues since the creation of a blocker", and that Facebook might present its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social network has been involved in the fight is a clear sign of how big a problem the industry has become.
Around 200 million people worldwide use advertising blockers, according to the last year's study Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of people using such software in 2013.
Taking into account 1.3 billion daily active users on Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's income.
However, the company is following the advertising blockers on the desktop, as mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in the Facebook mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, advertising in the desktop version is a sufficient income to make Facebook think of such a step of beneficial investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to renew its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how advertising is being targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that new Adblock filters are causing concern, as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem," said a Facebook representative in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a cruel tool, so instead we focused on creating tools such as Advertising Preferences to hand over governance to people.
Women moved to the Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after the woman moved several vehicles to the highway early in the morning on Thursday in an apparent attempt to commit suicide.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morg in the canton immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay in the darkness of despair and was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman 49 years old, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died in the place.
Several involved drivers have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, has been reported by the police who calls them and someone else who has witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a “logical” step in such a situation, said lawyer Gile Hofsetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be ascertained whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor needs to determine," Hoffsetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years allow drivers to assume that they will not be held accountable.
In each case, both of which involve a person in the darkness on the road, it has been convicted that drivers cannot expect a random meeting with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of the death of the unwarranted, after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 next to Payern at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that a police officer, who responded to the extreme challenge, managed the vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the existence of a person on the road was "a perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday next to Morg must call the police for 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been inhabited, according to the assessment of the new NASA climate model.
Researchers from the Warsaw Institute of Space Studies have developed a model for the previous Venus study using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climateologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have hot water-free surface and atmosphere, which was recharged with carbon dioxide, ever under conditions similar to earth.
The scholars had previously assumed that the small speed of Venus was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus could probably have had a split-up atmosphere like the Earth, and still be back slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but at one time there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent thick.
According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus places the sun’s daily side almost twice a month,” explained GISS Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
It warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as a sunscreen protecting the surface of the planet from substantial solar heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are, in fact, a few degrees colder than we are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that was previously anticipated by the study experts on the planet.
Although once Venus may have been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans have disappeared and its water steam has been drained by ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen flew, only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with the deadly greenhouse effect — Venus, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy leaves the Avalanche team coach post
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice-president of the hockey activities Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
The Executive Vice-President/Chief Commander of the Colorado Command Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noticed that the club was about to start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as chief coach and vice-president of Colorado Avalanche's hockey activities with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could improve this team to give her the depth she needed and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey should be ideally matched by the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patric told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won Jack Adams Award as best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was devastated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and played off for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points away from the Wild team in the fight for a second favourable trip to the Western Conference.
A knight from the Hall of Slavs, Roy won four Stanley Cups — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume negotiations and halt the strike
The oil strike in the North Sea has been suspended, and all the parties to the discussion are entering a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties have reported.
The attacks against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadicly organized on the platforms in the North Sea under the leadership of the Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and United and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," the joint statement states.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting next week to look at problems in a fresh light.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was more than 25 years old, was directed against potential pay cuts of up to 30 per cent.
The company Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid to contract staff working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The company's rates decreased after a 10% reduction in the rates for contract staff working on the coast in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it space necessary to overcome market decline.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil-gas activities in countries by 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-mergence with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low prices of crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated as a result of the decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, was vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared to the average value of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of turning stars into Pleiades.
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete directory of the speeds of the stars entering the Pleiades.
New data help astronomers to understand why the stars return at different speeds and how the rotation periods relate to the formation of the planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Louis Riball, a scientific officer of the Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades are buried in 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the grave are now only mature; they were born some 125 million years ago.
They're coming back as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak speed, these adult stars pick up large amounts of star wind.
On the way through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds cause the stars to slow down.
As the star grows older, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of known star feathers — such as the sun’s fins.
The new driving speed directory implies that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
The fish compares the stars to the dancers: the larger the pirates are slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Ballet we see that those who return slowly are usually more massive, while those who return faster are usually very light stars," said Ribal.
As Pleiade's excavation is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars to speeds of rotation.
"The Pleiade's constellation provides a starting point for the theoretical models of driving stars, both younger and older," said Ribal.
We want to know more about where and why the stars slow down their speed and wear their dance shoes.
Fish and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the speeds of speeding up Pleiades in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A study related to the activities of a group of detainees in Crimea of Ukrainian diversants is conducted by two agencies, writes "Commersant".
The FSB collects evidence of the participation of detainees in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, the citizen of the Ukrainian city Energodar Evgenien Panov agreed to cooperate with the consequences.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armenia, the Feodosia oil base, the Kerchen paramilitary transmission, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airports.
The law enforcement authorities believe that the detention has not been possible far from the partisans.
This, in particular, was the basis for arresting suspects in the Kiev Court of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Cerchesov was the main coach of the Russian football team
At the meeting, a decision was taken by the Colombo of the Russian Football Union to appoint as the main coach of the Russian football team Stanislav Cerchesov.
The contract will be awarded for two years before the end of CM-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS took the lead coach for the Russian football team Stanislav Cerchesov.
He is a well-known footballer who played in Moscow's Spartacus in the position of the doorman, as well as a coach with solid experience as a leader of Russian teams such as Spartacus, Zemzužina-Sochi, Terek, Amcar, Dinama, and the Warsaw League, who became the winner of the national championship and the country's Cup.
It is announced that the contract with the Church will be signed as soon as possible and expected for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that Miroslav Romaštenko, Gintaras Stauče, Vladimir Panikov will enter his training station.
There is information that the salary of the entire training staff will be 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the RFS management has set a goal for Stanislav Church to bring Russia together to semi-finals and to win medals.
As the coach himself said, he considered the creation of a competitive environment in the team as a priority and was going to give football players an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchess, he is pleased that the election fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Churchess will be held by Russia on 31 August in Antalya, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
In the past, Leonid Slucky, who combined him with a coach at the CSCA, was a leading coach of the Russian football team.
He stated his resignation after the Russian national team's Euro-2016 speech in France.
However, he took responsibility for the poor result of the collection.
Contradicting between Angola and the South, Namibia was severely affected during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after the independence of South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has achieved tremendous success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is the Government ' s emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries see free primary and secondary education as their own, many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools require education.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce training for “cost-reimbursement”.
However, primary education in Namibia is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015 secondary education has become free.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
The efforts to destroy malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent over the past ten years.
Despite the international trend in the growth of inequality, it is decreasing in Namibia.
Compared with the 1993 rate of Gini, which is the standard rate of income inequality, 15 points have been dropped.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased from nearly 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has greatly surpassed the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Index of Corruption, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that prices for raw materials fall, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt ratio to GDP is around 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least according to traditional methods of assessment, remains sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is nearly 17 per cent of the population.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is among the above-average income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia is, of course, facing some of the challenges facing the weakest economies.
The State must develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the territory of the country, isolated breeds of hunter-gatherers live in deserts, which must somehow be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
The integration of people who had been in the world economy for four centuries was a challenge for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not plan to lose its hands, and the country was addressing its problems.
Almost immediately after gaining independence, the authorities were involved in the creation of a diversified economy and a unified society.
It is remarkable that competing political factions have gathered together to work for common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of medical visitors to the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia spoke of building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians understood that the neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Namibian Government has rightly argued that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, helping to enrich a few from many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s natural wealth revenues need to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum proceeds from the sale of the country's resources, and review investment laws and profit contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, so strong support by the Government for freedom of speech is so important.
As Hage Gaingob, the media often say that he does not like it.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms obtained, the President said.
Not all Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Each year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that are beginning to face serious shortcomings -- racism, colonial structure, inequality and low levels of development -- can get on the way to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and representation.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 years before our era).
This was the most massive archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, a fantastic number of gold artifacts, more than three thousand pounds [6 kg], were found in the excavations of Varnen Necropolis.
Only one burial, known as Mogila No. 43, was extracted from 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the ancient gold of the world can soon be seen as a bus found by archaeologists in July of this year.
Once again, in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as the Tel Eunakis.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tel Yunaks are located far from the sea, near the village of the Yunaks of the Pazard region.
Busina is a gold belt turned into a ring.
Yavor Bajjiev, the digger in Tele Yunaki, dated the discovery 4600 years before our era and stated that she was the oldest of Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna are remembered for about the same period, 4600 to 4200 B.C.E.
There are currently no technologies to accurately date the metal.
How, then, can we be sure that gold is the oldest?
Professor Bajjiev obviously knows more than told the Reuters agency: "I am absolutely sure that the gold of the Young People is the gold of Varna."
It's a discovery of extraordinary importance: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a good place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bajjiev, scientists have reported that soon they will examine the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine the archaeological layer where a gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bus as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
The young people's body is a famous settlement even if you've never heard of it.
The Tel Eunatics are currently considered the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) for 7 millenniums before our era.
Over the centuries, metal treatment in this region has developed strongly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a fully-fledged industry.
The family history of this archaeological community has a special title: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the five thousand years before our era around the metal processing centres, settlements of the city type began to emerge.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tel Eunakis may be the oldest since the artifacts were found here in 4900 B.C.E.
I would call Tel Yunaki a prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is the older Shomera for a thousand years," said Bajjiev, referring to the common view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
The first cities were born there in the ordinary sense of the word.
The excavations of the Young People's Tel. have been taking place since 1976.
At that time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which once reached three meters high.
From homes and masters, there was little left, but archaeologists made a clear distinction between streets, public buildings, urban flats, business centers and residential districts.
The Young People's Tel is often referred to as "The Bird City": dozens of clayd birds have been found here.
All birds are represented in a state of peace, from which there was a assumption that they were not decorative objects but a local cult object.
"The Bird City" was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by the Indo-European tribes from the north-east.
There were no cities on horseback, so there were horses and weapons.
Three-metre walls have not been stopped.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of a brutal war: the remains of elders, women and children were found inside the houses with wounds inflicted by the battle towers.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the usual perceptions of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly speaking, not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” of the first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
The gold of Varna, found relatively recently in 1972, became a powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization.
It makes sense that Varna's golden shine must have been preceded by something like a tiny golden bush set up in the Young People's Tel.
In Porsche artificially old model 911 Targa
It has been officially declared that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being prepared by manual specialists working with serial machines.
The "Retro-Luk" is, for example, in the special color of the Etna Blue body, which was designed in 1960 for Porsche 356B - in this color even the logo of the model.
In addition, the targa has received a firm white chart along the board and a special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drive, as well as some piece design details decorated with "white-golden metal".
The retro-characters are less marked: it is largely distinguished by the grey-synthetic range of the design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical regulation and separate black anodized steel with the unit ' s logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car cheque and a well-distributed album with photos of the production process.
The strong installation of Porsche Exclusive has not been affected: the retro-trailer on the characteristics coincides with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbond duvet capacity of 3,0 litres, developing 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S is capable of speeding up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each specific athlete will be reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unloaded the "arms race"
The recent implementation of Facebook technology to prevent advertising on the websites of the network has prompted decision makers to block advertising for response.
In AdBlock Plus, they released a "anti-fighting", but Facebook plans to make it useless too soon.
So AdBlock Plus announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective soon.
The representatives of the Network noted that, in attempting to deceive a new “unblocked” advertising technology, AdBlock Plus’s decision, along with commercial announcements, also blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook they expressed regret about this policy by AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source of the techCrunch edition, a code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop, will be ready for the next few hours.
Thus, interlockers and blockers have disbanded their kind of “arms race”, trying to play with each other, who have suffered from the same side, have become users who have missed interesting recordings from friends or seen advertisements where they have not been accustomed to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of the blocking of advertising have recently caused heated disputes.
In Murmanska, the rapist will stand before the court · Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been finalized in the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murman Region.
The 54-year-old's indictment is very serious about committing violent acts of a sexual nature.
As a result, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Paula Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts using violence against 20-year-old girls.
Penalties under that article provide for maximum imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will import Fengguang 370 and Rich New pickup to Russia - Role www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular representative of the Chinese class of cars that combines the value of minivan and crossword puzzles.
Another alleged Russian prime minister is Pikap Rich New.
Many Western companies, the Moscow International Auto salon, have decided to ignore this year, so the vacuum of the exhibition halls "Krokus Eco" will fill the Chinese companies.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor, a strong front, has a great variety of Russian markets and plans to offer our drivers some interesting news in the near future.
One of them will be Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which sold in China at this spring price of 55,900 yuan (less than 550,000 yuan).
To the Russians, such a price is hardly clear, yes, and the issue of supplies in our country is still under discussion.
In China, for example, Fengguang 370, as a result of the June sales, was able to reach 11th place on the list of the most sold minivans, although due to high road education (175 mm) and the protective plastic cover on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be attributed to crossovers.
Crossween is built on the prefabricated new Fengguang 360 model, 370 of the same wheel base in 2725 mm, but the pieces are longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), more solid design, and more extensive equipment.
The living room is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical sensor screen "as in Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition specimens of the crossroads, and the machines with "music" were sold easily.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily composed, forming a level load area of 1650 mm, the maximum baggage volume of 1500 l.
The Fengguang 370 engine provides only one - 1.5 litre petrol "atmosphere" power 115 litres.
With regard to the dynamic quality of the machine, the manufacturer modestly reduces, as the savings budget of the owner promises an appetizer of 6.7 l/100 km.
Pikap Rich New is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the invited generation, but with a comfortable Chinese design.
Despite the moral ageing, this model has still been used as a stable demand for the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unscrupulous “worker’s horse. ”
At the same price, Rich New is probably interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become immeasurably expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two optional engines: petrol 2.4 l (137 l C) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 l C).
The transmission box is just a mechanic, the device is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a strictly connected "precious."
The representation of the Chinese company will be announced in June at the Dongfeng stand and the new flagman seat A9, his Russian prime minister.
The Chinese market has become increasingly popular, one of the latest news outlets - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian director Dongfeng is composed of two models: S30 and H30 Cross.
Seven months later, the Chinese company’s dealers made 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail - Site Under the heading www.zr.ru
The tax inspection changed the order for the sending of notices of property taxes.
All Russian drivers are used to the unaltered scheme: in summer and autumn, they receive a ticket to pay the transport tax for the previous year.
However, many of them will not be expected this year.
The case is that the tax inspection without noise has changed the order of notification of citizens.
Those registered in the "Personal Payer's Office" on the official website of the log.ru department will receive notices in electronic form.
In inspections, such Russians were automatically viewed as online users and removed from standard, "paper" shipments.
The news concerns all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive ordinary letters.
On the other hand, there is an opportunity to return to the old scheme for account holders on the site.
To this end, they will have to visit the Tax Office in August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the “personal office” immediately after its completion, when the letter will go for a few days and may be lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection service exceeded 18 million, allowing the department to be seriously saved on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some could be registered in the “personal office” to obtain a one-time service and have long forgotten it.
These people are not expected to receive notices by mail, and they will, without reference, fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the Personal Tax Office is made in three ways: through the entry of the gosuslugi.ru portal, by means of an electronic signature or the entry of the log and the password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person in any tax inspection office (depending on the place of account).
We recall that the transport tax should be paid by 1 December in the current year.
The notification was sent in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which aims to achieve a very high impact, is something in itself.
But the contested concept did not bother G-Power's masters, who took over the modification of Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its attitude to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63-571-strong flying shell with an aerodynamic tank and a discharge up to a hundred in 5.4 c?
With the "muscle" of the confused "gelic", the master took advantage of the five-litre-inhaled "eight-intendent" that opens.
And that's the dynamics of running up to a hundred has improved to an indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirpic" is capable of a 5.3 s.
On the other hand, speeding at medium speeds is probably much better for him.
The speed range is alarmed: if standard G 63 does not travel 210 km/h faster, the tunnel driver with a disabled electronic "fisher" is capable of exceeding 250 km/h.
In addition, the car is almost different from its original driver, except for the 23-inch Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The Lux Office of Mercedes-Maybach announced a 6 m-long striking conceptual coupon that would be presented in the Pebbl Beach Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with "green subbrand" BMW i and will move its electric models under a separate brand.
A minimum of four environmental news reports are expected in the coming years.
