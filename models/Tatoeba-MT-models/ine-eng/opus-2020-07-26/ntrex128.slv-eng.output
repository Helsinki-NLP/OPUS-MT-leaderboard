The members of the Valiant Congregation are concerned that they are ‘like Mupetka’
Some members of the congregation are threatened with the proposal to appoint MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc. member of the Valianian Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the congregation to the Valianian Parliament.
The members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned about smiling.
A member of the Laburist Congregation said that they were concerned in their group, "that the name of the Rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: in the baggy, twp means crap, and pwp to cock.
A member of the assembly from Plaid Kimru said that their group as a whole “not satisfied” and proposed other options.
The Belgian Conservative said that his group 'open spirit' was a change of name, while pointing out that there was a slight difference between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the word ‘w’ is similar to the word ‘u’ in the Yorkshire word.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing a draft legislation for the presentation of amendments to the name, said: 'The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the assembly will of course have to be adopted by members themselves'.
By law, the Valizjan Congregation has been authorized to change its name by the Government of Wales Act 2017.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valianian Parliament.
For members of the assembly, the Commission selected the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but in the public consultation it received the most support for ‘MWP’.
Members of the assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching agreement will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who must present a draft amendment legislation within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the congregation operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the function of members of the congregation and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their appointment.
The Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote Sunday to change the name of their country to ‘North Macedonia’.
They wish to resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece's neighbour, whose province is Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its request for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including President Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name is the only price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s church have been silenced because the churches in Harlem are facing problems.
“The older people I was talking to say that they used to be bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
‘Today neither one nor the other’.
He explained that the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are different today.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighbors where people start regularly.’
He is concerned, however, that money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that soon they will be back in the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with a common administration (condominium) where people who would not help shelter in the neighborhood that remained.
“Many people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that is why the day will come quickly when all these churches will be closed, as it is unlikely that people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built Belgian religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The first Belgian Methodist Church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black religious community that served as a center of worship nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the Black Church community under the leadership of the honourable John Howard Johnson, who was on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who did not want to hire or support blacksmiths.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but when the parishioners planned to rebuild Johnson’s father, they ordered bells for the raid.
Honoring David Johnson, the son of his father Johnson and his successor in the church of St. Martin’s, he proudly called the bells “the bells for poor people”.
The expert in July called them "cultural foundation" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a dark-eyed musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he held larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced by St. Martin’s in church.
In the church of St. Martin’s, in the last few months, a complicated story has been carried out with architects and contractors; some have brought church goods and others to the chapel.
Zakristija – the administrative body of the parish, made up of time – wrote to the bishop in July that she was concerned that the bishop would “try to carry the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the shed.
The Marine Dog injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, he attacked a marine dog and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters during the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. in the vicinity of Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the TV KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, about half an hour he drowned with his friends when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then with the group he swam to him and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the lobster and then found out that he was screaming "He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed he had a broken whole key.
"I have every one of them to go out of the water: "In the water is a sea dog!" he added.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of the Council in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The kind of sea dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The water saviour, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press statement that a few weeks earlier, a marine dog had been spotted in the area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of the body.
In 48 hours, they prevented access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to the Swami’s beach in Ecinitas due to investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of marine dogs in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beautiful corners, as they have in the beehives, and with professional staff.
As part of the British beauty market that is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while selling clothing and household appliances falls, more beautiful corners will be tested in 11 country-wide shops, and the next year in more trades if they prove to be successful.
They decided to invest in beautiful products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill out the policies used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s, they say that they will double the offer of their beautiful products to 3,000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space in areas with trademarks similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also revitalizes its botanical offer of cosmetic products, so that most of the vegan products – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury’s shops. The first week was opened in Croydon in southern London, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
Due to the online purchase and daily purchase of small quantities of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury’s, said that retail trades would be similar to the benefactors because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with multiple services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury’s group has opened the Argos outlet in more than a hundred shops and also the Habitat trade since it bought both chains two years ago, which has increased food sales, and the takeovers have been more profitable.
The previous supermarket attempts to rebuild their sections with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products were unsuccessful.
Sainsbury’s flew a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the bond ended after the dispute regarding the sharing of profits from drugs in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 sales to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago by GBP 125 million.
They said Lloyds would play his part in this plan, because in four stores they should expand the offer of luxury brands for skin, including the brands La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, attractive environments and convenient locations, and it means that we are now an interesting destination that is a challenge for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is angry because Holly Willoughby's gone out of work worth 11 million pounds.
The star plays Dragons Day (Good Business) is angry because Holly Willoughby's TV director has withdrawn from work worth 11 million pounds, with his trademark of life-style to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand clothes and Truly's accessories.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The director of this morning's show, 37, announced on Instagram that he's gone.
Holly Willoughby angered the dragons Dan Peter Jones, as she recently withdrew from their lucrative business with a trademark of life-style to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The Viri say Jones was "barred" when a golden girl on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his Marlow's headquarters in Buckinghamshire admitted that due to her new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – there is no time left to dedicate their brand names to Truly's clothes and accessories.
The company compared the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and announced that it would double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When she announced her 37-year-old Willoughby on Instagram that she was leaving Truly's trademark, Jones fled from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source says: "Truly was far more important to Holly.
It would be her long-term future to survive the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely disillusioned all involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, because the opening was so close.
A warehouse full of goods prepared for sale is located in Marlowa’.
Experts believe that this Morning, which is among the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would be the company’s departure from the leader’s tour of the show because of the large investments in products, from the pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, as well as additional delays in opening.
Moreover, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were a good friend of ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby set up True together with Cappova in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
In addition, Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S trade mark ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I’m A Celebrity’s I’m.
The source near Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business matters."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism of the media because of a comment that some feel to be "unprecedented" and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up like that?
With his grinning "newer" voice, Trump said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Her first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the "response" of the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead of this, the United States continues to be subject to sanctions with which to continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his contract.
"With North Korea we are doing great," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had brought positive results – they stopped testing the rockets, helped free hostages and brought home the remains of the American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
"It can be very Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get to this site full of scenes, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and showed the crowd directly in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, more than a hundred dead
For example, when dealing with the consequences of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok have been displaced, natural disasters have not been declared, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases it was very clear that they did not require international aid, so the situation was somewhat complicated,” Sumbunova said.
The Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not clear if foreign personnel can help.
Sutopu, a representative of the National Disasters Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and ascertaining whether they would be able to help international agencies.
In view of the fact that the earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the state remains totally unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In Asia, shelters were built after tsunami, but on the other hand, this is not common practice.
The apparent absence of a warning siren for tsunamis in Palu was likely contributing to the loss of life, although the warning applied.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is also a challenge at the best of times.
Because of natural disasters, logistics is even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is to help the victims of the earthquake in Lombok, is sailing towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of destroyed Indonesian infrastructure in front of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for the Jokov administration in re-election next year.
Yoko is also faced with the pressure of long-term tensions among sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and more than ten thousand were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim armies fought on the streets with swords, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge winner for late settlement against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a hit in 89 minutes before defeating Chelsea in the 1st English league.
Sturridge has accepted the delivery of Xherdana Shaqiri of good 25 meters before Chelsea's goal while remaining his team 1-0.
He put the ball on his left and shot at the remote door.
The arrow traveled high above the criminal space against the upper right corner of the neck.
The ball finally went down through the door of Kep Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I’ve just tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq, always pulling it as far as I can, so I’ve only tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn't think much more and decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half-time with a hit by Belgian player Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the Blue Attacker gave the ball back to Mate Kovacic and fled to Liverpool's half.
He snuck in the middle quickly and got ahead.
Then he gave it through the defense and Hazard fled to the prison.
Hazard was in a hurry to defend himself and shot his left leg against the remote doorway through the Liverpool gate of Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, in the group part of the League of Champions.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton at the League of Europe on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832 and the state accident agency reported on Sunday morning.
The representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that many people were affected by a Friday earthquake of 7.5, which triggered six-metre waves captured in the ruins of buildings.
The palace, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is a wasteland of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for murder, after a woman was stabbed to death
Police launched a murder investigation, after finding a woman's body at Birkenhead in Merseysid this morning.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews building on John Street Street and arrested a 32-year-old man for murder.

I also call on all, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something on camera footage to get in touch with us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman was Birkenhead, and they found the body inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the crime scene who thought they knew a woman and asked where they found her in the morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police inform the women's property.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he was left without a word.
The residents have now been told that it can take more than one hour before they can reenter.

Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the most recent memory target of the dispute about "rewriting history"
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical followers of puritanism.
But Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal "insanity" and "a attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of the statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the West Minister of the Palace will become a target.”
Iconoclassism in the English Civil Wars Cromwell did not even execute orders.
Maybe for the actions of his predecessor from the past century, he's going to be a victim of the wrong Cromwell.
A brilliant presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of the 19th century, Cromwell, is a part of the history of personality that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell's numerous (maybe even more late in the 19th century than today) are seen as a protector of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course monarchy.
But it's a very precise show, it's the subject of continuous historical discussions.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed a further development of our people, and Cromwell was recognized as an individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was Lord's protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Killer pig killed a Chinese farmer until death
After reporting local media, a Chinese pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in the south-west of China.
The man who was identified only by the reception of “Yuan”, found a dead man with a cut artery and blood clot near a pig market in the town of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday at the South China Morning Post.
The word of pigs is being prepared for the vaccination of pigs at the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, in the province of Qinghai, China.
After reporting, I should travel with my cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said that there was a big pig's male in the pighouse with a bloodthirsty mushroom.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig killed the farmer until death.
“British feet were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin with the title “Wu” was quoted in the magazine Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed pigs.
They found his body about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs had been shut down so that they wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
The Yuan's family and market manager are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of swine seizures have been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with men suffering serious physical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig pressed the rolling farm at the tractor, but then the woman took the animal away.
After the pigs ate the farm from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "launcher".
"We'd just play.
They're like little children, very cheerful... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to show them enough respect," he said.
On the southwest of the United States due to the remnants of the Rosa hurricane, heavy rains are coming
According to the predictions, Orkan Rosa is moving against the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and weak.
However, in the next days, Rosa will bring the rains in northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
From Sunday from 5.00 a.m. to the east time, Rosa is category 1 with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, above the Pacific Ocean, the low air pressure area is strengthened, moving east against the western coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baj California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will suppress high tropical humidity against the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rose will bring up to 250 mm of rain in the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, a tropical moisture mixed with low air pressure will produce abundant rainfall in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will result in dangerous flooding, flooding and the possibility of land use in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some towns will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west parts, especially above the larger part of Arizona, is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rainfall.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be very thoughtless to put a foot in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into a river, but storms will bring local wind and dust into the air.
The approaching low air pressure area will bring local rain to the parts of the coast of South California.
Rains above 12 mm are possible, which may result in less precipitation and off-roads.
This will be the first rains for the region during the rainy period.
A few scattered tropical vessels will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoons and Mondays early in the morning, late Mondays and Tuesdays will spread.
Heavy rains will spread across the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In the United States, in October, large temperature fluctuations can occur, as the Arctic cools, and tropical regions remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
The week is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there are 20 degrees of difference.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stop and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern US will enter the warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to the parts of the north.
In New York we could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good opportunities for temperatures above the average for the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on the six television networks have seen an interesting fourth story of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman charged with sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political position continued, as television stations have interrupted the regular program due to Friday's conversion in the last minute: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI will conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Fordova told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had dumped her in a guilty state and tried to drag her to high school.
Kavanaugh said in a burn story that he was 100% convinced that it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people would be seen.
The company accounted for the average viewing of television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that conducted the witness, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the damage of viewers who watch the program in the offices.
For a easier performance, the audience is similar to the one when playing a football game ending or awarding the American Film Academy.
The TV Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support the Kavanauch's appointment, leads to all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
The interest also remained high after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in Friday's drama.
After the mayor's office gave a statement that he would vote in Kavanough's presence, CNN and CBS recorded on Friday morning that the protesters yelled at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
In a few minutes' time, he hung his eyes, and the cameras of the CNN TV house were captured alive.
"I'm standing here in front of you," some woman told him.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have power while many women are weak."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and he added that he was going to give more to the committee's hearing, and then the door was shut.
All television networks were also given live hours later when the Justice Committee voted on the submission of the Kavanaugh nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do this if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, to which the minority party of the Democrats called.
Flakea was partly convinced of the conversation with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decided because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes for the appointment of Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the US Federal Investigation Office (FBI) regarding the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused criticism of "playing political games" in brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, criticized her plans for leaving the European Union for "playing political games" with the British future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Therese May's arrival at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In a further interview with her on the cover of the magazine, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit Plan and said that it was a proposal that Britain and the EU pay the second “absolutely.”
Shooting on Waydea Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of death by the LSU team
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Waydea Sims, a 20-year LSU basketball player.
After the Baron Rouge police report, a 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for charges of murder.
Officials published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police indicated that during Sims' fight, he lost his sunglasses.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB's TV reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
Security is $350,000, the lawyer reports.
A mirror from the East Baton Rouge Parish district issued a previous report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The police are grateful for the assistance of the investigation leading to the arrest of special units for the Luusian state police, the criminal police lab, the South University police and the residents of the area.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva team thanked the local authorities for their "care and search for rights".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The previous season, on average, collected 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps at the game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade team told us that the team was "strung" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano ashtray in Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighbours of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans not to get near the volcano, as activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center has observed several cases of thunderstorms and thunderstorms.
Photos on social networks showed thin layers of ashes that covered the windshields of cars in the vicinity of the capital city of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres south-east of the main city after the September 2017 earthquake hit central Mexico with 7.1 degree.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters supporting independence clashed with anti-police police units and thousands of people joined the rival demonstration, marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarized withdrawal vote.
A group of masked separatist supporters, who kept anti-police police units, wrapped them with eggs and metal in dust, thus creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were also fights, where police officers had to use hangings to stop the clashes.
Supporters of independence, who have been calling for several hours “without forgetting, without forgiveness”, have faced Protestants who support unity and shout “We live Spain!”.
As local media reports, fourteen people in protests have suffered easier injuries.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was marked in Madrid as illegal and the Catalan separatists celebrated, tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, although the participation was low, since the opposition to the separation had greatly boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote on the polls in the region in violent clashes.
Groups supporting independence camped at night in front of the polls to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry happily because they could choose, but now we were pushing," he said.
Despite the important, although close victories at the regional elections last December, the Catalonian parties supporting independence are difficult to maintain this year's initiative, as many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or are awaiting trial because of their role in organizing a referendum and later declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest with the phone in support of the police, explained that the protests had defeated politics on both sides.
“Tension is getting high,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he will run for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Registering in European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men who flew into the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested because they took their car into Londonderry house several times.
The incident occurred in the street of Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19.30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said they were damaged by the door and the building itself.
At some point, they're supposed to be shooting at the car with a single gun.
With the cover of Mengaya, Livingston won with 1:0 against Ranksom
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingstone won
Livingston suspected Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach of the Ibrox club.
The Dolly Mengay arrow made the difference, because Gary Holt's team was equal to the Hibernian team elsewhere.
Gerrard's team thus lost the victory in the guests of this year's championship, and next week, they are waiting for Hearts, who lead on the ladder and behind which they are behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone has increased its ranks of failure in the six-game division and Holt's chief coach, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced defeat.
Livingston has opened up opportunities against direct guests
Holt's team should be leading a long way ahead of the mission, as with their directness, Ranksom has caused a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but the ball sent through the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the door, and Craig Halkett shot through the goal with his head.
The guests left the game Ranksor because they knew that guests could be dangerous when the attack breaks.
And in this way they came to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingstone a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and beat from the center of the prison.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but the domestic defenses couldn't break and Liam Kelly's door didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was defending Kelly.
The doorman of Rangers's Allan McGregor shot Scott Pittman with his foot, and Lithgow was shot naked from one of Livingstone's stops in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingstone's penal area, but the locals refused all attacks, two violations – Halket's violation of Glenn Middleton's replacement and a hand-playing offence – but the judge did not arrive.
“Excellent performance” by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Excellent performance and result for Livingston.
They were all excellent and continue beyond expectations in this way.
The style of the game and bet they haven't changed much since their return to the top, but Holta needs to be credited for the way he woke up the team from his income.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and made good arrangements for a well-organized defense, while Menga kept in readiness for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
However, the range simply lacked inspiration.
Although under Gerrard's leadership, they are severely lacking in these standards.
There was a lack of target shot – only once they successfully won the guest defense – and this is some kind of Awakening for Rangers, who met in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, they ruled over smiles and blue skys.
Today is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes about human rights, the freedom of the press and the Turkish approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were able to get closer to seeing their president.
His opinion was also expressed by hundreds of Protestants – many of them Kurds – who do not support the Erdogan government and condemned Erdogan's policy and decision by the German government to greet him in the country.
Contrary protests reflect the separation of visitors, whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes and others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: the biker died in a car racing accident
There was a fatal accident in London during the race in which the car was involved.
An accident occurred near the crossroads between the streets of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at about 10.15 after British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the rescuers came, but the man died in the accident.
An accident occurred only a few months after the bike died in a race in which the car driver fled, about 1.5 km from the Saturday accident on the Children Street Street.
Police have made a statement that police officers are checking the identity of a man to be able to inform the property.
They set up roadblocks and rerouted the bus lines and advised the motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six guards injured in an emergency
Six prison guards were injured in an emergency in a strictly protected male prison, reported by the prison administration.
He broke out of HMP Long Lartin's prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30 after British summer time and is still running.
Police officers from the "Tornado" unit have been called to take care of an emergency involving eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
Less damage to the face was provided to the guards on the spot alone.
The representative of the prison staff said: “We have called a specially trained staff who will take care of the emergency in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and may therefore be further behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous perpetrators of crime in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in hospital because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called the anti-police unit in prison to intervene in a serious riot in which the personnel were attacked with billiard bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of Orcana Rosa narrows the way through the southwest of the desert and brings the danger of sudden floods.
The National Time Service has already issued a warning to the sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa is supposed to get mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be approaching late Monday with the rain.
The National Time Service in Phoenix stated that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) was about 60 kilometres from the border of Arizona.’
The latest models of the National Orca Centre provide 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual rainfalls up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including Rockies and Great Basin, there are expected to be between 25 and 50 mm of rainfall, individual rainfalls up to 100 mm.
For areas beyond the danger of sudden floods, the rain of Orkan Rosa may be a blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall will probably be useful, as the drought is currently taking place in the southwest.
“After the US drought tracking centre has been indicated, good 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Orcana Rosa leads first to the land of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the strength of the hurricane on Sunday morning at the maximum wind speed of 137 kilometres per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm comes in contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
The land in Mexico is expected to reach with the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The falls in the parts of Mexico may be large and therefore present a great danger to the navigable.
“From the Baj California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with 250 mm of rainfall”, they reported on the website weather.com.
Orkan Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and against South Utah until late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger that we expect from the Orca of Rosa or its remains is the abundance of rains in the middle of Baja California in the north-west Sonor and in the south-west American desert," they said at the National Orca Center.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden flooding and flooding in deserts and land-times in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for the sum of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old in Somerset with stab wounds.
The early teenager was found in the Excellence Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4.00 after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police from Avon and Somerset report.
The cops are calling everyone who's got a cell phone on the phone, maybe they're gonna catch up with them.
Trump said Kavanaugh was a "suffering and angry" democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugha is a voice against intolerance and unheard of the tactics of a democratic party," Trump told the assembly in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was a "suffering and angry" democratic party in the process of its appointment.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of the convention on Thursday, with Christine Blasey Ford's accusations clearly and emotionally denying her sexual assault ten years ago when she was a teenager.
She also talked to Ford about her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that the day “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliantness, quality and courage”.
"The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugha is the vote for the appointment of one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service," said a number of supporters in western Virginia.
The President specifically mentioned the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the electoral participation of Republicans in the interim elections.
"For five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I am really trying with the candidacy," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for excellent candidates."
Trump argues that democracy is on the mission of 'responsibility and obstacles'.
The first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh Senate was to take place no later than Friday, the advisor of the Republican Party told the CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami of hundreds of people killed, the number of victims is increasing
On Saturday, the authorities reported that in the earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people died, a number of giant waves were taken off the coast.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Pala, when six-metre waves hit the coast and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people stayed on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesian agency for the relief of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, everything fell to the ground with him,” explained Nugroho and added that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people had come to the trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, fences and broken bridges and walls surrounded by water.
The stormy suns continued to search the coastal city on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million people, they felt a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in the Fridays is about 200 times greater than the power of the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow valley, is to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “beneficial” and said that more than a thousand homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and the damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area of Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho said, the communications are completely interrupted and they have no information from the Dongall area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” said the statement of the Red Cross and added that staff and volunteers are moving to affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms, since it did not inform the public that the tsunamis had affected Paul, but officials say the waves had arrived just in the time of the issue of the warning.
On the amateur video published on social networks, it is heard that men on the top floor scream warnings people on the street in the approaching tsunamis.
In a few minutes, the water wall ran off the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused an electricity shortage that has disrupted communications around Palu, making rescue actions difficult for the authorities.
The authorities report that the military has begun to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities of life.
The airport was opened only to provide aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in Indonesia’s tsunami has increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Doseb, the members of the World Vision organization from Dongale arrived safely in Pala, where the employees in the courtyard in front of their rooms set up shelters from the dams, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of desertification.
“They told me they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with much experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
In accordance with the Indonesian Regulations, the overseas funding, stocks and assistance of personnel shall be authorised only if the city of an accident is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still considered as an accident at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'okay, this is a national accident', we can accept international aid, but there is no such status."
The second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and relatives of the missing ones cling to the hope that their closest miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped for two days under the ruins, and her mother’s body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of Indonesia's nuclear paratroopers, trained two missing Asian nuclear paratroopers who ended up in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The second, caught at Roa Roa Hotel, was by the word of Mr. Mandagija his students.
"As an elder in the field of nuclear paralysis, I bear my emotional burdens," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that in an hour when the news of the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel circled around the community of sailors, he was in despair sending messages to whatsApp competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages were marked only by one gray stick, instead of two blues.
‘I think this means that the messages were not delivered,’ he said.
Tats stole $26,750 while filling the ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee
After reporting to the Newport police, the dads stole 26.750 USD from the Brink’s security staff on Friday morning, who filled the ATM in the center of Newport on the Leeve.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the fun complex and was preparing for the delivery of money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a public statement.
While he was employed, another man “approached to the Brynk’s employees’ security service from behind” and stole the money bag for delivery.
After the report, the Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants.
All who have information on the identity of suspects should call the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name in Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – in Ye.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: "Betje with the official name Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has a title Yes for a while and he also used it for the title of his eight-year-old album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his performance at Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who rejected the performance for ‘personal reasons’, told the author of the show.
The word is reducing his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious significance for him.
“I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where “you” means “you”,” West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you and I'm all me.
Kanye, which means “one”, I changed into Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects everything we are."
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire to be named Love and Brother Love.
The former West's collaborator, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with thought or without it and with large letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that he would never use military force against civilians, just as the country nears the 50th anniversary of the violence against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza market that "he will never use the army to trap the Mexican people."
At a time when left-wing student movements began operating in Latin America, at peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968, soldiers started shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly grants and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education drew young people into criminal associations.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funds it spends on research in this field, a true investor and expert for the artistic intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the American government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: their goal is to become the best in innovations in the field of artistic intelligence by 2030.
"The duplication of the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are quite good for the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the possibility of next major achievements in the field of artistic intelligence in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’, published this month's Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most visible intelligence companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed an art intelligence system that won the highest-ranking American player Othello and later was Executive Director of Microsoft Research and Chairman of the Chinese Google Office.
Lee said he was familiar with the previous American government's technological competitions, such as the battle in robotics organized by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when he would find the next visionaries more easily.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard to get state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, but it’s companies,” Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working best with the university in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer a green card to people with an artificial intelligence doctor," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science is funding people in academic institutions, like the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sector, and announced the establishment of a joint committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of $2 billion.
The National Scientific Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in artistic intelligence research
Meanwhile, American legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has done nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide at the referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday at the referendum to change the name of their country to the 'North Macedonian Republic'. This would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their request for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has put a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, but the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 percent, as much as it is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum sheet was: ‘Are you for membership in NATO and the EU by adopting an agreement with Greece?’
The sponsors of the referendum, including the President of the Zoran Zaev government, claim that this is a price worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have emerged since the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote which will be decided.
The amendment of the name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission has notified that no irregularities have been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to choose for my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a populist from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško, gave their votes in Strumnica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 for a referendum in Macedonia on the modification of the name of the country that would open the way to NATO and the European Union.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small oven and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro pean integration."
The President of the Zaev Government says that NATO membership will make a very necessary investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after delivering his election card.
He added that it would be a positive result of 'the confirmation of our future'.
The survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that the referendum would take place between 30 and 43% of voters, which is less than the required electoral participation.
The second survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents would prefer Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote for them.
In order for the referendum to succeed, there must be a 50-percent participation plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious impact on the policy of the Western government, which took over the mandate last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has played the entire Brighton defense and victory
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense in Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England.
Aguere's mission in 65 minutes was looking ridiculously simple.
At the start of the action, the Argentinian attacker accepted a play in the middle of the game.
He ran between the three Brighton defence players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defensive player and was faster than the other on Brighton's penal space.
Then he gave Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the prison space, the English attacker returned to Aguere, who with his right foot beat Brighton's doorman Mathew Ryan and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is facing problems in his legs," Coach City Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We have agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he hit the goal at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave his blue son an initial advantage in the first English league.
The goal was reached in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
The dream touched the ball several times, and then sent the ball to Sterling against the remote door.
The blue boy's attacker pushed the ball into the net just before she flew past the goal.
The city will meet with Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12.55.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and ruin their ability to address
The Nationals team has fallen out of the finish line, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always the competitor Scherzer hopes that he will be able to raise himself to the metal cricket against the Colorado Rockies team on Sunday. This will only happen if Rockies still have the opportunity to play in the final because in the Western League they have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
Rockies won 5:2 on Friday over the Nationals team provided at least the organizer's invitation, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
“Even though we can’t get anything, we can at least play in the excellent air in front of a lot of people here in Denver and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
So why don't you want to compete?"
Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metal in a week, but in this case it will probably be metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, which will be so first metal 34 times, is Thursday as a load player and would have had enough days of rest by week.
Washington's right-wing player collected 18 wins and 7 wins with an average of 2.53 and 300 hit-outs in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at the meetings in West Virginia
The President directly addressed the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the interim elections.
"Everything we've done will be on the dice in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I am really trying with the candidacy, so I am fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats and it is happening now.
They're determined to take over the government again, using all the means they can.
They care about anyone who is affected, who needs to be able to get power and control. This is what they want, power and control, but we will not give them that."
According to his words, democracy is on the mission of 'responsibility and obstruction'.
“And you have seen this in the last four days,” he said and labeled the Democrats as “serious, evil, low and false”.
A prominent member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, heard a loud protest from the community.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. That was really bad body speech, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When an activist from Momentum in my local party told me that, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who are not interested in expressing my opinion.
My colleagues, Ambassador Joan Ryan, happened the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, he went on a proposal of non-confidentiality for my non-compliance with Jeremy Corby.
Given the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party meeting was notified on Friday that ‘we want meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In eight years, as a member of the parliament of a local laboratory party, Friday meetings were mostly exactly like that.
Unfortunately, such a tone is not used in most meetings today, and the promise of "more friendly and gentler" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has started at all.
It is increasingly apparent that different views in the labyrinth parties are not allowed and that each opinion assesses whether this is acceptable for the client’s management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues, whom I had previously thought to share similar political views, expected me to change my opinion and take a stand that I would never agree with – whether in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – they follow criticisms on social networks that call for an election, condemn the policy of the centre and tell me that they shouldn’t be in a labyrinth party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments I make are just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet each day with the flood of sexist or racist condolences, but they are not allowed to be frightened.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become something quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that a laborer must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with every proposal of uncertainty or change in the rules for the choice of a party becomes more careful.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to turn my head off and not be so loud, and I will be "all right" with me.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, the reason for this was the lack of interest in the Government of Tatcher, which has literally led to the collapse of my primary school, I have tried to become a local councillor or government minister for better public services for those who need the most.
I've never been hiding my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused because of my political positions and areas I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their wishes after the waste of time and energy to discuss my commitment to the leader of the labor party at a time when the state is swimming against a brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my right message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of a labor party or not: I am proud that I have served you, and I promise you that no threat of choice or political suitability will turn me away from doing the best of all of you.

38:17 Melrose: the face of the father is over the shoulder.
Two well-known experiments have led to a few failures, but there is no doubt that Ayr won the victory in this wonderful fun first-class game of the day.
Now they're at the top of the ladder and they're the only unparalleled team of ten.
In the end, the weightier on the domestic side has translated their top defenses and better use of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
"In our advanced games we have endured many trials and we are still unattainable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Happy Ayra team, opportunities have taken better advantage than we have."
Grant Anderson's mission in the 14th minute that Frazier Climo turned, Ayr took the lead, but the Romanian card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received it in the game with the Warriors, meant a number of superpowers for Melrose and Jason Baggott was pressing the attempt without conversion.
Climo has increased his leadership for Ayr in the case of a violation, before he hits at half time and then turns himself into a self-test for score 17:5 for Ayr in the case of a storm.
But Melrose began the second half and tried Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, to reduce the remainder to five points.
It followed a long interruption due to the serious damage caused by Ruaridh Knott, who was carried on the carriages, and then Ayr progressed with the experiment of Stafford McDowall, which he converted to Climo.
The provisional Captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received the Romanian cardboard and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with an unreformed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to the obstacle to the Clim without a ball MacPherson got hit in the attack.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong's throne and sent Gregor Henry's wing player in the fifth host's attempt.
Star of the Still Game series starts a new career in hospitality
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is apparently presented in the hospitality, and is expected to become the director of the licensed company with restaurants.
A 56-year-old in a popular BBC series, also written for the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with a long-term partner in comedy Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that after the next ninth season, Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, Arigingmorn Limited is the Director.
The player did not want to comment on the stories, but the source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan want to be included in the "flowering hospitality" in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there are marked sea blue flags.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with a slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
In the province of Bolivia, memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute due to natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive, as is the greed for the tropical flood of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will receive it after five years of consultation on 1 October.
"Bolivia has a beginning, a spirit of unity and impartiality, and of course a positive spirit awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will decide in the province of Bolivia, which insists that, after decades of unrest, it has to negotiate on Bolivia's access to sovereign access to the sea.
Here Morales, the Bolivian charismatic native president, who is awaiting a controversial battle for re-election next year, has also high expectations regarding Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court will not decide in Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
The United Nations Office at its headquarters in the Netherlands has not authorized Bolivia to allocate Chilean territory and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is only six months after hearing the arguments, means that the case ‘was not complicated’,” said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't spoken in Bolivia, but they may have a lot of standby.
"The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the question of access to the sea," Zárateev said.
Morale’s aggressive rhetoric from the Chilean people had all the good intentions that might have remained, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
They haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivian representative of The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "excellent opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "conclusion of 139-year disagreements with each other", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political resistance.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific”, he added.
‘The decision is an opportunity to make sure that we have to overcome the past.’
North Korea stated that nuclear disarmament would not happen if it could not be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never destroy their nuclear weapon first if they could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.
The United States called on them to fulfil their promises made at a meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Minister Mike Pompeo was apparently in the process of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which was at the dead point, more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the U.S. is wrong if they think that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the announcement of the end of the Korean war in North Korea will turn on their knees.
Washington is careful in approving the prediction without first taking decisive measures to disarm Pjongang.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
But the general doubt is that Pyongyang thinks seriously about quitting the weapon that the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion magazines in Paris, discover the latest line of huge covers coming to shops with affordable brands near you
If you want to fill in your collection covered or completely hidden from the sun, you do not need to search further.
The designer Valentino and Thom Browne discovered in their collections for spring and summer 2019 on fashion trails a collection of amazing superstars that blinded the slogan in Parisian fashion week.
Very impractical cover this summer, Instagram flooded, and the designer sent their spectacular creations to the fashion track.
Valentine's piece, which was most prominent, was the hat in the beige color with wide cuts, decorated with feathers similar additions in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too many fashion accessories included skulls with precious stones, magic hats and even pineapple – but your heads will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed the choice of bizarre masks – just the right time for the night of witches.
Many colourful masks have succulent lipsticks and are more similar masks to Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation was similar to a blower with a breath and glasses, and the other was seen as a grain with a degree of ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
The fashion experts predict that the giant covers will come to a store near you.
Wide hats are closely followed by “La Bombi”, broken hat with 60-centimeter edges, among other things, were observed in Rihanni and Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult brand for an extremely non-practical hat that flooded the social network sent another great creation – a broken beach bag, which was almost as big as the manikin in the baths it was wearing.
The bag of raffia in a burnt orange color, surrounded by raffia resins and with hands of white leather, was the central part of the La Riviera collection in Paris in spring/summer 2019.
The founder of the famous Luke Armitage told F EMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to arrive at the store for the next summer – because the designer made such a powerful impression, it would be difficult to ignore the need for too many additions.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is key to global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoyed the fames of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a number of outstanding results in the exams that are further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, you are represented by the Scottish Single School Council (SCIS), trying to provide the highest level of service for your students and their parents.
Independent schools want their students to prepare for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the city they have as global citizens.
As the education sector, which can shape and implement the adapted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and want to be selected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the conversation will come to his mind.
But if you speak with a man in his mother tongue, words will come to his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results from recent studies show that languages at the top of the ladder are at the highest levels of success in self-schools.
68 percent of students who have learned that language have achieved a good score.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of the students achieved a good grade in Mandarin and 72 percent of the German students, 69 percent of the French students, and 63 percent of the Spanish students.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are considered to be the subject of choice in school plans and elsewhere in the fields of natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A study carried out by the Commission in 2014 for the employment and training of the United Kingdom showed that for reasons why employers are struggling to fill vacancies, 17 percent of us attribute a lack of language knowledge.
Thus, language knowledge is becoming increasingly urgent in preparing young people for their future career.
For future employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, he has a great advantage in the future, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge.
A multilingual person who can agree directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 survey by YouGov, covering more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, with France being the only language spoken by the two-way percentage of respondents, that is 15 percent.
So investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding adequate employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that should be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, you will always be able to choose many languages taught by experts in this field in independent schools.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of what the future brings.
The global business environment cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debit in San Diego on Sunday in Lakersov's dress
For fans who are delighted with LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, it's about to end.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in a Sunday's opening game scheduled for the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one and less than 48” explained Walton on the official website of the Lakers team.
The official rapporteur of the Lakers team Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers games before the season.
"At this stage, I don't need a race before the season," he said.
trumpet assembly in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling in West Virginia begins a series of meetings in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five planned meetings next week, including the formations in its countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for the free place in the Supreme Court is not yet confirmed, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened with losing the control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's assembly in West Virginia and where online will it be possible to see him?
The trumpet assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 19:00 a.m. after Eastern time.
The trumpet assembly in West Virginia can be viewed live on the YouTube channel.
Trump will probably talk about candidates' hearings for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court this week, which has become tense because of allegations of sexual misconduct, which is why the confirmation in the Senate is expected to be postponed for one week to conduct an investigation by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, to get a new start.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump, these five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of them in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Observation at the Congress is so important for his programme that the president will travel in as many countries as possible during the hard season," Reuters told a representative of Trump's campaign who did not want to be appointed.
Today's conference at the Wesbanco Arena Centre in Wheeling would also be attended by supporters from Ohia and Pennsylvania following the report of West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract the interest of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who remains in public research.
"For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the president must come and "get him up" in public research," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, after Reuters report.
Ryder's Cup 2018: US team still wants to win and maintain hope before Sunday's solo competitions
After three foreign games, the two foursomes may have been what Ryder's castle needed this year.
There was no invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where did it go now?
“They have had six points of advantage, but now they have four, so this is probably a new start for us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage because it leads to four points, and 12 more can be achieved.
But the Americans feel that they have wind in the sails, and among other things, the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Speeth was doomed from the initial strike to the greenery and gave a good example.
The crickets of happiness continued to become louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and I were left with two points equaled in the fourth game.
The hit that won them on the 15th of August, he set up a similar scream, such as to let you know that we believe the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to look for your inner power and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Ryder's Cup.
An unusual but charming two of Europe has won four of the four points and they are unforgivable.
The two Molliwood was the only one who didn't hit the bug on Saturday afternoon, and the bug was avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy flows between them and the noisy community clearly confirms the fact that the players who are going to be defeated on Sunday are the ones who are going to be defeated, and no other player could better seal Europe's potential victories than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over the Le Golf National.
Well, maybe they're both in different holes at the same time.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Serge Garcio, a morning hero in the game with four balls, who was in a couple with Alex Noren.
Because of buggy and two double buggy in the first nine holes, Spain and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
But on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and twins of two are exceptionally interesting to follow from close due to communication between couples, advice given to them, advice not given to them, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better than a team so far and has a great advantage before the last day, but the two of them have shown that the US team also has a wish to win, which some, especially on the American side, have questioned.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe goes to the last day of Ryder's kiss with a great advantage after the four-ball games and the two-player two lead with 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent couple made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, he gave all of himself and with two matches over Tiger Woods and at the Le Golf National sloth he scored four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophy that she lost in Hazeltin two years ago, had in the morning games four balls of power over the American team that had sinned and reported in a series of 3:1.
The U.S. team was better able to resist in the doubles where they won two games, but the balance could not be rewarded.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 special fights if they want to keep a trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newspaper to win four consecutive points, while with Molinari (the couple called Molliwood) only another couple who won four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder's Cup after the sensational end of the week.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they again proved and won even more convincingly the spent Woods and American newspaper Bryson Dechambeauja with 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliantness at moments, but lost 19 of the 29 games in four balls and two two, of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was starting to play with four balls in the morning, came back for the doubles of two and a couple with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who are ranked on the first and third world ladders.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, everything did not go according to the plans of the European team.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for the Americans on Saturday.
With 2 and 1, they firmly defeated Spanish Jon Rahmu and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two, losing the first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's history did the team return after the remaining four points in front of the single battles, although Fury's team only needs an equation to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in another place, the Sunday attack may seem too much to attack.
North Korea: "Without confidence we will not be isolated"
The North Korean Foreign Minister announced on Saturday to the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions would cause increasing mistrust in the United States of America and that under such conditions North Korea would certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapon.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Authority, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had adopted a number of 'significant measures in good will' over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, substantiating nuclear testing sites and promising that they would not spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see an appropriate US response,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not be convinced of state security and under such conditions we will not ever be the first to become unilaterally disarmed."
While Ri reiterated the well-known claims of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a progressive approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking the step-by-step measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as it had done in the past in Pjongang.
Ri made a joint statement by Kim Jung Una and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader, which took place on 12 June in Singapore. Kim then pledged to strive for "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pjongang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not allow the call to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The US insists that we must first be nuclearly disarmed, and step up the pressure with sanctions to achieve its objectives by force, and even object to the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“In thinking that sanctions could put us on our knees, it is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t know us at all.
It is a challenge, however, to continue to impose sanctions on us further deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US President presented to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun J In, which took place over the past five months, and added: "If the problems of nuclear disarmament were to be discussed with South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be agreed upon at such a dead point."
Nevertheless, the tone of Rije's speech was quite different from that of the year when the United Nations General Assembly said that the attack on the North Korean missile-coreland region was inevitable, after "Mr. Trump Kima designated "a rocket husband" on a suicide mission.
This year Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations Assembly and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that this was not a time frame for this, and he said: ‘The duration may be two years, three years or five months – this is not important.’
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament situation."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously accepted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo and Rím met at the United Nations General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparation at the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, and North Korea criticised him in a few hours, if his demands were ‘ganster’.
North Korea committed itself, at a meeting with Muna that took place this month, that the substations would become a missile test and a nuclear test infrastructure if the United States adopted the "appropriate measures".
It is to be said to Kim that the ‘appropriate measures’ mean the security measures that Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University attend a course they learn how to take enough time to rest
The aim of this new year's course at Harvard University is to teach all graduate students how to enjoy more sleep. They want to fight against the growing masquerade culture of "celenonic" learning, in which the powers are accumulated with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the best universities in the world often do not know the basis for caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, formed a course of his first kind in the United States.
In order to implement such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
After the lecture, a girl approached him and said, "Why do I know this just now that I'm in my last year?"
She said no one else told her how important a sleep was, and for The Daily Telegraph, the professor said it surprised him.
The course that is first held this year is about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University's Health Services, says that they decided on this course when they found that during the week, students were severely deprived of sleep.
The single course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the picture is the door of the student's home, where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports blankets and books to get information about the influence of caffeine and light, the effect of lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of sleep patterns.
In the second section, participants find that long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student village with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that the conduct of students will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to get acquainted with these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health affects smoking cigarettes," adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride in “lifelong learning” is still present. It also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, are growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be “skinned weapons” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also prevent the gain of weight – the brains, due to the lack of sleep, are becoming hungry, causing students to be constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler to form a course. Last year he attended one of the professors' lectures at Harvard.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct classes throughout the student village.
It hopes that during the next phase, the undergraduate students will be able to request the completion of a similar study programme before joining the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to continue to sleep as well as to wake up. He also wants to point out the harmful effects of the "modern light" given by electronic displays and LED lighting, as they can cause imbalances in the circus rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with mattock subtopil upe Gerrard team
Rangers once again defeated in the guests: Dolly Menga in Livingstone convicted Steven Gerrard of defeating 1 : 0.
The team from Ibrox hunted her first guest victory after February at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but Gary Holt's team beat her second defeat in 18 matches, since she was at the head of the team Gerrard, leaving his team behind 8 points for the leading team of the Scottish league.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the chosen species of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
With this, Rangers fell into a common place, and Livingston progressed into a third place, but with the difference of goal, the Hibernian team remained.
The weight of Rangers was not over with this. Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered a head injury when after reporting to him he flew an object from the city of fans of the guest team.
Gerrard, in the crew that beat Ayr without any trouble and got into the semifinal Betfred Cup, made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt held a checkup to Livingstone's unit, which had taken over the hearts team point a week earlier, and was no doubt thrilled to see how his affected team had effectively neutralized all the guests' attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingstone made better use of it.
The first chance came two minutes after Menga first found Scott Pittman, which then went to the goal of Allan McGregor, but was linked to the execution of misdemeanour and missed the opportunity.
Long free shot Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but the ball then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to get into the goal.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game more pointed to hope than the actual wish after the victory.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after the race with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the match, a criminal shot was to be reached, but Judge Steven Thomson's demands for Colombia were thrown into the quay.
In the first half of the year, Rangsor managed to draw up only two shots on the goal, but he did not shoot with the head sent against the goal by Lassana Coulibally, or Ovie Ejari's ball, which presented no danger to Liam Kelly's doorman.
Livingston’s opening goal in 34 minutes may have surprised everything, but it has already been fully deserved because of its endurance.
Rangsor failed to cash out another Jacobs' resume with a long time.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi to deliver for a simple conclusion of the attack.
Gerrard took action and, during the vacation of Coulibaly, replaced Ryan Kent's wing player, who immediately showed up with Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off with his lines and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in its role and forced guests into its game, while Lithgow and Halkett provided more supplies before goal.
Holt's team could have increased leadership by the end of the game, but McGregor had effectively neutralized Jacobs and then Lithgov was out of line.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the opportunity for a criminal shot after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not admit it.
Almanah: Geiger's Designer
We present a side from the Almanac of our weekly editions: September 30, 1882, so today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, who later became a world-famous physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger's shield.
This became a stable in the scientific world, and it also gained its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientist:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's safe. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your ears on, you can hear the effect on atoms of radioactive activity in materials.’
Evans: "Madonca, now they're really getting out of here!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd birthday.
But the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can be learned by the immune system to identify attackable cells
The new cancer vaccine can be taught by the immune system to identify and destroy the attackable cells
The vaccine in the course of treatment teaches the immune system to recognise the attackable cells
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells in patients who have subsequently been modified in the laboratory
Thereafter, ‘see’ protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, may be returned to the patient
The results of the trial vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise the attackable cells, the cancer in the ovaries has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of the immune cells of the patient that are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research from Bethesda in Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several different types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and gut cancer.
A similar approach to the acquisition of immune cells in patients who are “learned” to target cell cancer has also worked in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a protruding point on the SNL by writing MAGA on the drop.
The community was not thrilled.
Kanye West was excited at the Saturday Night Live show studio at a strange point, during which he expressed his support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would compete for the president's chair.
After the third song of his performance, called "Ghost Town", which was accompanied by the song "Make America Great Again", West began with an attack on the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
"Well, if I was concerned about racism, I should have moved from America long ago," he said.
This time, the SNL performance began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood player was blinded by Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Justice Commission in a Senate accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The video of the West Monologue was not screened, but it was put on social media by comics Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make it out of West.
West also complained to the community that he had some problems in the west because of writing on the gates.
"They've got me behind the dress.
They said, “Don’t go to the top with that capo.”
I've been seconded!
But they say I'm lost," he said after the Washington Examiner report.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see the lost scene?’ and added that you have to find “Superman’s border, because that means that no one can show me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments were prepared by the community at least twice and the members of the SNL team were obviously upset, and someone told Vanity: “There was a death in the study.”
The West recently invited a goat exchange for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The West has produced a lot of surprises already with the video track for the song "I Love It", where he wore a costume of the Perrier mineral water bottle.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who said, "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for being UPRL RAJI."
But Karen Hunter, the leader of the conversation, insisted that West is simply what it is, and that's all right.
However, I will NOT reward someone (with the purchase of his music, clothing or support of his "art") who, in my opinion, welcomes and extends the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he changed his name and will then be “a being, formally known as Kanye West. Now I’m YE.”
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name, but before him did that, did Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His resident colleague Snoop Dogg was once named Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: the Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then he was an Artist, once known as the Prince.
A man accused of attempted murder because of the arrest of a person at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after he was stabbed by a man at a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
Police say an event happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused must be brought before the court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
The star of Kit Harington's throne has acted sharply against toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known after his match to the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-colored fantasy series The Games of Prestables.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a mastician hero says that due to the appearance of such applications on screened young boys, they often feel that they can only earn respect with integrity.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that in his opinion something went wrong, and wondered how to cope with the problem of toxic manhood during the #JazEvendi period.
The player, recently married to a 31-year-old player from Rose Leslie's throne, admitted to having strong convictions about this topic.
“I’m personally seriously wondering where we’ve made a mistake when it comes to manhood,” he said.
“What did we teach men during our upbringing about the problems we now face?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of the male due to the presence of very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What are we taught on TV and on the streets to make young boys feel that they have to choose the exact same kind of manhood?
I think it's one of the important questions of our time, how can we change it?
Because apparently there was something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series of the following summer he would not participate in the recording of any preview or continuation of the Game of thrones, because he had “closed with battles and horses”.
Kit will play in the main role of the new True West Sam Shepard show, which is a story about the film producer and his brother rapper.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the Games throne was that he met his wife Rose on the video.
"For this series I met my wife, so she gave me my future family and life from here on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a love choice of Kit's character Jon Snow, in a fantasy series awarded to Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the possession of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of new cases are reported from China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In most new cases, the disease has been transmitted with sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, HIV has usually spread rapidly as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with HIV in the province of Junan has decreased by almost nothing.
Still, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases annually in China for 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV to the Chinese community is a very serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very widespread.
As conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men are reported in time.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised general access to medicines for the treatment of HIV as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff has issued data on Republican senators, condemns “dangerous lies” and “theorie of conspiracy”
On Saturday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected the accusation that a member of her staff had published information about three American Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The democracy in Los Angeles has insisted that these accusations come from individuals and websites to the right.
"Liars, lies and more unresolved lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter statement.
The published information is based on domestic addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha from Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, which was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill, during a senate meeting on charges of sexual harassment of the candidate for the Supreme Judge, Bretta Kanaugh.
The information was obtained after the three senators concluded their hearing of Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that it is possible to identify through IP the source of the publication to be associated with the office senator Waters and to conclude that the information has been published by some of the staff, reports Hill.
“These unwarranted accusations are absolutely wrong and pure lies”, Watersov continues.
"My employees whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these false charges are not responsible for the termination of these data.
These unwarranted accusations are completely false and pure lies.’
Senator Waters' statement quickly ran into criticism online, including by former representative of the White House for the press, Aria Fleischer.
“From this lack of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
"This may mean that it's not from the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he hasn't done, he can't show his anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the accused.
You must remain calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the town of Waters in the interim elections, reported on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's serious," he tweeted.
Watersova stated in his statement that her cabinet had notified ‘the relevant institutions and prosecution authorities regarding these false charges.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be disclosed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for instructions on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and is also used to revive Johnny English's action comedy, which came into effect for the first time in 2003 with the title Johnny English and the following in 2011 with the title Johnny English 2.
Will a fun satire about how we're screwed, a new export opportunity for us?
The uncompetent Johnny English, with his eyelids and unusual thunders, gets permission to re-mix the strips; his name already indicates that it is a comic character, created for a cinematographic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is an ingenious secret agent who despite his bizarre moves contains a part of Clouseau, Mr. Beana's canchique and the smallness of the one who contributed the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the tourist and international mystery network that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV advertisement for Barclaycard, leaving behind a real chaos.
One or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wore medieval armor, and the rotor lists were brief about his helmet.
Atkinson’s comedy gift is clearly shown, but humor seems a few mild and unnecessary, especially since “real” films such as 007 or Mission are now impossible without bad news.
It seems that humor is meant for children and not so grown-up viewers, so for me to deny the adventures of Johnny English are not as innovative and targeted as Atkinson does not jump into the role of Mr Bean.
The constant theme is now obvious that Britain is in serious trouble.
The web hacker infiltrated the network of British most secret agents and discovered the identities of all British agents, causing great problems to the competent agent, which Kevin Eldon, in a remarkable small role, represents.
This is the point of a break for the prime minister, a promiscuous figure that has already experienced a break because of political unlovedness: Emma Thompson has tried to play the role of the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing in the scenario that can help.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies are exposed, so she must decide for one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a high school teacher who teaches informally how to work undercover: here the screenwriters have won, because English is performing some kind of spy 'academie rock'.
English is being taken to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where he meets a long-term employee of Bough, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the commander of the submarine, a stereotype sports inspiration, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is almost lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more problems on behalf of the secret service of her Highness, and they meet with the fatal Ophelio Bulletin, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is in danger of being influenced by a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: this is the evil Jason Volt played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their departure: dressed in a fire-fighting fan in a French restaurant, create chaos when you try to create a general chaos on the roof of Volt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for the apparent reality to get to know the inside of Volt's house.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energy, it mentions the children's film.
Very average.
Like in other movies, Johnny English, I can't help myself here, and I don't think: is the British film Atkinson able to give a role that actually warrants his talent?
Labourers deny that British are planning a four-day work week, which would pay for a five-day work week.
The Labour Party of Jeremiah Corby is thinking about a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive payment in five days.
The company's leading party wants the savings created by companies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence to flow to workers and allow them to have an additional day off.
So the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high pay.
Vires say that the idea corresponds to the economic plan of the party and to the plan for the state to be placed on the side of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to a four-day work week, as this is a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: 'The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but the four-day worker is the goal we will strive to achieve by the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party supported the four-day work week in its campaign in the 2017 general elections.
This objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day work week is not the policy of the party and the party does not think about it."
The Chancellor in the shadow of John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to exert the power of "invisibility director" and "recipient" in municipal companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current stakeholders in the water companies may not get a full share again, as a laborer might be able to introduce ‘debts’ on the basis of alleged crimes.
It also confirmed plans to include workers in the administrative committees and the introduction of the Ownership Inclusion Funds, which would transfer 10 per cent of their share in private enterprises to employees who would thus receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the “60 minutes” series whether their opinion could change the Kavanaugh investigation carried out by the FBI.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the FBI has led to a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of any Republican senator's office could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview held on Sunday, the author of the “60 minutes” issue of the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find out anything that would change her opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this charge came up, I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, unrestricted, uncertain."
Graham's voice seems to be stuck in a rock.
"I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would need a very convincing reason for his change," he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know that Brett definitely did not, ” added Graham, mentioning Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those who were named could confirm this.
She's 36 years old.
I do not see any new changes."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens (Global Citizen Festival) and whether or not it has contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event involving a truly exceptional type of star and having the same extraordinary mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by dozens of people. It will be attended not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to stimulate interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the removal of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens' Project, an international pro-vocative group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (except if you are prepared to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a type of task or ‘action’, such as a volunteer, a letter to the world leader, a telephone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is the movement of the Global Citizen, which has remained for 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concert the right way to convince them to demand action, or is this just another example of the so-called ‘clickivism’ – creating a belief that people actually have a significant impact on the relationship with the signing of online petition or the transmission of tweets?
Global Citizen's move suggests that since 2011 more than 19 million 'actions' of their supporters should be noted in their efforts for a variety of objectives.
It says that these actions have helped global leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than US$ 37 billion that would affect lives by 2030 more than 2.25 billion people.
In 2018, the Group indicated that the fruit of its 390 commitments and communications had already been paid or collected at least US$ 10 billion.
The Group estimates that so far, funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to "help children realize their full potential", which Rwanda promised US$ 35 million to help eliminate nutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the Global Citizens.
“With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can talk about the social guilt of nutrition in the historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Moč Prehrane, at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that the government, after more than 5,000 actions taken, which the United Kingdom called for the improvement of the diet of mothers and children, announced that it would co-finance the Food Power project, which would reach 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?",
the movement Global citizen replied: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and we will be defeated.
But like a great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid in front of us, we will also succeed, because together we are stronger.
Among some performers that will take place at this event in New York, are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will lead Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a Navy - the US Interior Ministry for Russian Energy Exports
American Interior Minister Ryan Zinke would have told Washington Examiner that Washington could use the Navy “if necessary” to prevent the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said Russian mediation in Syria (to be warned that the legal government is invited) is an excuse for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that there is a reason for their presence in the Middle East to want to market energy, as they are in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," I would say.
According to the official, however, there are ways and means of dealing with this.
"The United States can do so. The Navy ensures that our maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumer Union, a non-profit group known as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was actually the same.
"As regards Iran and Russia, the economic potential is more or less the impact on and the exchange of fuels," he said, marking Russia as "a pony who knows one trick" with a fossil-dependent economy.
Statements were made at a time when Trump's administration was trying to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it was intended to exacerbate Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, government officials in Trump, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany that it would give up the North Stream 2 "unacceptable" gas pipeline project, which would lead to a "taller" of Moscow in Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the North Stream 2 is worth USD 11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas capacity by 110 billion cubic metres, except for the economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is an unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for implementing pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called for the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"Involving a third country in our energy supply is a major problem for me," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly study" his candidacy for the US President's 2020 election, a true Massachusetts senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "examine her candidacy for the US President after the mid-term elections".
In the city house in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider her candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, as a woman's leader requires," The Hill reported.
"After November 6th, I will study my candidacy for the President in detail."
Warren's meeting in the city house was built by President Donald Trump, as "this country should lead in the wrong direction."
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I'm really worried," she said.
Warren Trump and the candidate for the president of the Brett Kavanaugh High Court have been openly criticised on several occasions.
In a statement published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course before the elections we need an FBI investigation."
The poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren should not compete for the presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Centre, a senator should not run for a president, eight-hundred percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-three percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that the former governor of Deval Patrick had more support for the candidacy, with 38% of the respondents being supported and 48% opposed.
Other high-ranking democracies that would be considered as a candidate for the 2020 elections are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Poor after the report of the Associated Press agency, he said he would decide by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned a post-traumatic stress disorder in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, survived a year of military registration in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of family violence
“When my own son, who experiences his return, connects me with other families dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and certain extent of the injury our soldiers are returning with,” he told the assembly at a meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palinova's son's arrest was marked as an "isle in the salon" and said that her son and other military veterans were returning a few changed, hardened, wondering where respect for what the Soviets and the refugees and all the other members of the army were giving to the country.'
Track Palina was arrested on Monday at Wasilla in Alaska and accused him of violence in the family with assault on women, obstructions in the registration of violence in the family and possession of weapons in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a police station representative in Wasilla.
18 Federal States and the Colombian Districts Support the Refuse of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian District support the legal rejection of a new American policy that denies the right to asylum to victims who flee from violence or domestic violence.
The NBC News Agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the above-mentioned districts filled court proceedings on Friday to support the legal opposition of politics.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which was filed by the American Association for Civil Liberties v. Federal Policy, has not been published.
She said that her partner and "his violent sons, members of the crowd", abused her, but on 20 July the American authorities rejected her asylum request.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the states that support Grace are Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum applications in the United States have been described as countries that constantly cope with problems with family beatings and violence.
In 2014, the new U.S. asylum policy annulled the decision of the Committee on Immigrant Calls, which enabled unregistered immigrants fleeing family violence to apply for asylum.
The State Prosecutor of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "respects the decade of state, federal and international law."
‘The national law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application and that such a prohibition violates this principle’, states the application lodged at the Court.
State prosecutors further claimed that a policy that denied immigrants the right to entry would harm the US economy, as they were likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary labour force".
The Judge General of State Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to grant any more asylum to victims who were fleeing from domestic violence and violence in June.
‘Assil is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,’ Sessions said on 11 June in their policy publication.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems people face every day throughout the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are under way to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said a 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma when she comforted her hot boy at the evacuation centre in a broken town of Pal.
"The rescuers constantly import bodies.
It lacks clean water.’
It seemed to be locals, returning to destroyed homes that had been swept through the crowded things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were overloaded.
Some injured, including Two Haris, who suffered back and shoulder injury, were resting outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated freely because of the constant strong excruciating suns.
When he mentioned a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was living with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to get rid of it.
I think I was pushed against the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency. He added that he was with his family in town because of the wedding.
"I heard a woman calling for help and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "submitting" with "propaganda ads"
One week after the publication of a four - page publication of the official Chinese magazine in the U.S. newspaper, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador in China Beijing accused US press abuse of spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last week mentioned a paid supplement of the Chinese Daily Officer in Des Moines Register – the most sold magazine in the state of Iowa, after China accused interference in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denied.
The Reuters Agency reported that US officials charged Trump with attempting to interfere in the US federal elections, described as a new phase in the ever-increasing effort of Washington to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasingly intense trade war in which they exchange strikes by introducing customs duties on imports.
The Chinese refund rates at the beginning of the trade war were to be affected by exporters in the Federal States, such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to the Chinese and former long-standing governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had been affected by American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of Officer Des Moines Register, "now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
“In the expansion of the propaganda, the Chinese government has used a valued American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in the Officials of Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions on the stands with the magazine in Beijing and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have about the worrying Chinese economic path, as the Chinese Communist Party is strictly in control," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese magazines rejected the offer for publication” of his article, although he did not indicate which.
The Republicans lose their voters prior to the interim elections with the Kavanaugh branch, the analysts warn
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important republics supporting and defending the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite more charges of sexual assault, will be known to the upcoming interim elections with the loss of elections.
The feelings here are extremely high, but most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of polythology at Maxwell University College in Syracuse for an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI would last be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow and also no November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national representative of the MoveOn Group, on Friday, following the report of Officer Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang "November is coming!" when they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate, when the Republicans who oversee the Judicial Committee decided to continue their support for the Kavanaugh appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported the news portal.
"The inspiration and motivation of the Democrats will go beyond all borders," the portal reporters told Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say they're strong now, and that's what they're holding.
But it could be even stronger, especially among undiminished voters in suburbs and smaller voters aged 18 to 29 years who do not like the president, but do not often.”
Even before the Ford public witness, in which she described in detail her allegations of the sexual assault of the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that further Republican support could have a negative impact.
“This has become a major confusion for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, after the NBC News agency reported earlier last week.
"It is not only the vote of the Council or the final vote or the Kavanaugh vote; it is also the way the Republicans are meeting with it and how they dealt with Fordovo," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA Group, told the television channel, who supported the Democrats in the elections.
But Americans seem to be a few divided during this, or more likely to believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a few more support from the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or most likely to believe the testimony of Ford, and 35 percent have been told that they are sure or most likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or probably lied to during the talk, and only 30 percent said that about Ford.
Following the pressure of FBA, Flakea is currently investigating the accusations made by Fordova, and at least one of them, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford's last week before the Senate's court-martial, she swore that when she was 17 years old, Kavanaugh attacked her in a guilty state.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed sex when they were together at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, a world-wide inventor, is opening a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners' open-ended Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupta's purpose was "to rule the world".
"We decided to do this now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create a "personal storage store" or POD
This may include information about contacts, mailing lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage repository is that the user can fully determine who can access the information.
This company is called "personal data-relief".
Executive Director John Bruce says the company's idea is to combine resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow the Solid platform to be accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, a few hired developers for work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "with Facebook and Google are not talking about whether they could introduce a complete change that could put an end to all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask for permission."
In a Saturday publication on the Media Portal, Berners-Lee wrote that the purpose of Inrupt was "to ensure commercial energy and the ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee was established by a consortium of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"As for the next time, I'm very optimistic," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the Victorian Cross of the 1st World War
In the home city for 100 years, the division of the Victorian cross to the only minister of the English Church who won it as a fighter in the first world war has been celebrated.
The Honourable Lieutenant Bernard Vann deserved recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, though, he was shot by a gunman, so he never learned that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two Colonel's grandsons discovered a monumental stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered 100 years after his grandfather’s act, with which he deserved his distinction.
According to officer London Gazette, Colonel Vann, on 29 September 1918, led his battalion through the Canal of Saint Quentin, "the very dense fog and under the powerful fire of the battlefield and machinery."
Later, he planned against the shooting line and led the line with the "most hero" and then attacked the machine and beat the three members of the squad.
Colonel Vanna shot a German sharpsman – only a good month before the end of the war – on 4 October 2018.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the old father's actions were "something I know and I could never achieve, so he teaches me humility."
With Dr. James Vanna's brother, they put a wedding ring on the parade led by the honor of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this paradise" and "that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give it."
Incentives to mixed martial arts were spent all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, Puise Pepe was involved.
Imagine: All night long you were praying to watch a completely sold Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose had 13 matches, including the sixth on the main park, and it was carried alive in the United Kingdom on the 5th Canal.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a meeting, the audience in the United Kingdom found that the transmission had been replaced by the performance of the drawing by Pujs Pepa.
Marcikdo was not very excited because he stayed up until morning just because of the fight.
One of the fans described on Twitter the child’s picture as “a kind of painful joke”.
‘In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a child programme,’ said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Bellator Organisation for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Pepa's heart." Yeah."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that future audiences in the United Kingdom would also be involved.
"When I think about replaying, I think we could fix it," Coker said.
"Then there's six o'clock in the morning Sunday and we won't be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
We're all working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged at the time of the switch and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix the problem; we thought it was just a technical mistake.
However, there was a real reason for the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will have five fights — as usual — and we tried to offer fans more than expectations and saved ourselves from them.
It is a very ungrateful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "defeated" about sexuality.
The Olympic fan Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior to anyone — but it gave him motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that he was aware of “not every single way” as he was himself when he entered high school.
Speaking in the first edition of Desert Island Discs, which was run by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4 radio station, he said he spoke about gay rights to give another "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, he had reduced his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular conductor, Kirsty Young, has been absent for several months because of her illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outsider in Laverne's first edition, said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to have boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, these feelings of inworthiness and diversity are a real thing that gives me strength and endurance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was “something” and said that he would not disappoint anyone who finally realized his direction.
Twice the bronze Olympic competitor became an influential advocate of LGBT law and appeared twice this year at the National Community Games in Australia in order to call on countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy, that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time World Cup winner said he was a novelist with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he met in 2013 – “remarked.”
Daley reported last year, but said that the difference in years never meant problems.
“When you are so young” – at the age of 14, he participated in the first Olympics, and three years later his father died – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
A couple of June adopted a child, son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that this changed his "full view".
“If I were asked last year, everything would be to say that “I have to reach the gold medal”, he said.
“Then, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if he already had tickets for London in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead did I finally have to admit that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive into the Olympics before the home community. There was no better feeling," he said.
This was also inspired by his first selection of songs – the music channel Heather Small, which followed him in the preparations for the Olympics and at which his skin is still warmed.
Desert Island Discs play at BBC Radio 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mikkelson was the president of Ryder's court on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to go back in shape so it won't become an accident border.
Mickelsson, who will be involved in the two-week event for the 12th record, left Captain Fury sitting on Saturday's four.
Instead of being at the centre of the event as often as it was for the United States, the five-time winner survived partly as a cheerleader and partly by improving his games in order to correct what he was struggling with.
In view of the fact that even at the top of the career, the 48-year-old does not match the best narrow game Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably punishes the wrong hits.
And if only the game wasn't scary enough, Mickelson would be dealing with the British Open Francescom Molinare on Sunday in the ninth game this week, which was in the lead to win all four games this week with the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans who have four fewer games at the beginning of the 12 games would start well, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Fury expressed his trust in his man, or he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he hugged me behind his back and hugged me with his hand and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"There's a lot of trust in you.
He is one of the famous and in the past, and also this week he has made an exceptional contribution to the team.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it went out and we thought it was supposed to be.
He wants to play, just like everyone."
Mickelson will record Nick Falda on Sunday for the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the conclusion of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Fury said that his presence in the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
"It's fun, sarcastic, funny, it likes to work crazy from people and it's great to have it in the crew room," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun when they moved this week with him, which was fun to see."
It gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon come
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage can easily be transferred to an uncomfortable ride at the beginning of the last day of the game of the people in Ryder.
Young Danec debuted in 1997 at the Valderram game, where the side of which the captain was Seva Ballesteros had five points of advantage in front of the Americans, but through the goal she was only in favour of the hair, with the result of 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
“Don’t forget that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but hardly,” said Bjorn (on the picture) after watching the team Class of 2018 , who won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and told at the Le Golf National playground 10-6.
So history tells me and everyone on the team that the baboon isn't over yet.
You're playing the full tomorrow.
Go and do what you need to do.
It's not over until it's like that on the table.
We have the goal of winning this race, and we must remain focused on it.
I've been saying that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn added, excited about the game of his players in the challenging game: "I would never have rushed here.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
Tomorrow will be the front game of individuals, so it will have to be fought differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, and when you're there alone, your skills are tested to the end.
This is a message you need to convey to players: Tomorrow you need to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind, and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three of four points.
Fury himself was already on both sides of the transformations on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a defeater when Europe carried out the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every funny word," he was answered when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, told his players in the final day of the game.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this startup gets endurance, it's a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We created the right setting and put the boys in a way that we felt we were going to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a battle and compete with Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys, I have decided on this order because I think it covers the whole schedule,” Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
A new German warship has been postponed
The latest German naval frigate should be handed over in 2014 to replace the old-fashioned warships from the cold war, but the local municipalities have reported the failure of the systems and the rapid increase in costs by at least the next year.
The transfer of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the new class Frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now transferred to the first half of 2019, says the official Die Zeit, who tells the military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project raises worrying questions after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships, commissioned in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen class fregat.
It is expected that they will have a strong top, a type of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and some cover technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer distances between maintenance – the latest frigates should be able to stay outside the port of home for up to two years.
The constant delay, however, means that the top-level warships which would allow Germany to influence over the sea by its power will have become obsolete by the time of application, says Officer Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 Freight appeared on the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Bohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
The first time that happened, the sailor returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are known only a few, and German municipalities have identified a number of key "programms and technical shortcomings" which would make the warship useless if it were to be sent to a combat mission.
The deficiencies of the software were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class would run the crew with about 120 sailors – only half the working force on the older Bremen freight.
It has also proved that the ship is a heavy burden, which reduces its capacity and limits the ability of the Navy to build its future.
The 7,000-ton vessel ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ should be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the whole project has also become a problem – including training the crew.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) from an initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fractals are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is decreasing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the sailors were in fact "despite vessels suitable for navigation."
The officer said that the issue had become heated over time because the old ships had broken down and the replacement vessels had not been provided.
He complained that the Navy could not join any of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of Netopers
A new research is being carried out at the site of the Scottish Highness, which seeks to find out how bats use food when hunting for food.
They hope that the results will further highlight the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help direct future conservation activities.
In the research, scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats and brown bats and round bats at Inverewe Gardens in the Western Ross area.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations to monitor the activities of bats throughout the whole season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of netopian calls and what kind of action they are doing.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their conduct throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of lawns and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
The risk also represents wind turbines and lighting, as well as mussels and certain types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
But because of the nightly habits of hunting, they help themselves more with their ears than with their eyes.
For the precise determination of errors and obstacles along the path of years, a refined echolocation technique shall be used.
NTS, which is responsible for providing more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of the country, does not take the country very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out investigations, screenings and temporary rescue.
At the property of Thrave in the Dumfries and Galloway area, the organization has set up even the first and for now the only Scottish reserve, specifically intended for bats.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says the estate is an ideal territory for them.
"We have an excellent area on Thrava for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all quality habitats.
But there is still a great deal known about bats, so the work we do here and in other holdings will help us to better understand what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on holdings, as the possible accidental destruction of one bats' own relative could lead to the death of up to 400 males and young people, which could mean the loss of the entire local population.
The bats are protected, therefore they are forbidden to be killed, beaten, or disturbed, and their relatives are also forbidden to be destroyed.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the Networking Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still need to learn a lot about our bats and for many species we simply don't know how well their populations are. "
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, and lawyers prepare for the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charges of rape that he was supposed to commit and said that people want to “promot themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to file a German magazine with Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of forcing an American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375.000 for the silence of the event.
In a speech of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after reporting Ronaldo, 33, marked the report for "false news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news," said a gold ball winner in the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I'm a happy man and I want to be good to everyone," the smiling player added.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing themselves for the Der Spiegel trial after the Reuters report for the charges called "an unacceptable report on suspicion of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schhertz said that the player would claim compensation for “an amount of non-monetary damage corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was scheduled to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
In the documentation submitted to the District Court of Clark in Nevada to return to the player's room after a meeting at the Mayorg club with Ronald.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after that event and told her that he was a '99-percent good man' who disappointed only in 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations, but described it as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital had taken pictures of her injuries, and later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was “a terrible vengeful ball” and cared for “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that he wants to cancel the settlement because of the alleged incident, he still has a severe trauma.
Ronaldo was just prior to the alleged attack from Real Madrid in Manchester United, and this summer, after an agreement worth $100 million, he moved to the Italian great Juventus.
Brexit: United Kingdom would “debt forever” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would ‘be sorry forever’ if it had lost the status of the leading world car manufacturer after the break, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'anxious' that Toyota UK told the BBC that a UK withdrawal from the EU would temporarily suspend production in a factory in Burnaston, near Derby, without an agreement.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay on the border in the case of brexit without agreement could lead to loss of jobs.
The Toyotina model Auris and Avensis was produced by the company Burnston last year by nearly 150,000 cars, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that in the event of Britain leaving the European Union without agreement at the end of March, production in our factory would be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyotin in Burnston.
Concerned about how the outcome of the European Union without an agreement would affect cross-border trade, other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, also expressed concern.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit for a month, it would close its factory Mini in Oxford.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain, in the case of frexitis.
Toyotina’s production line operates in accordance with the principle of “in the right time”, with suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU coming every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom from the EU failed to agree, this could lead to a disturbance at the borders for which representatives of the Panogue say they could cause a halt and a lack of work.
Toyota, in her factory in Derbyshire, could not be harmonised for more than one day, said representatives of the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Therese May's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly designed to avoid such border checks".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the present success, but to seize this opportunity," he said about today's BBC Radio 4.
"The data not only toyote, but also other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not comment on how long production would have been stopped and warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the United States union in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "After my experiences, the lost job never returns."
The government representative said: "We must present a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
The trumpet meeting with Rosenstein could be interrupted again, the real White House.
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "represented for another week", the White House said on Sunday, due to the ongoing fight against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugha.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian pre-emptive interference, links between Trump's employees and Russia, and potential presidential obstruction of the judiciary.
The question is whether Trump, an envoy of the Attorney General, will forgive and threaten Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington's speeches for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a hearing machine to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein's missing the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, in the middle of a report on his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations Conference in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein 'would not forgive', and then the meeting was held to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of improper sexual conduct, Dr Ford.
On Friday, Trump determined a one-week investigation of the charges against Kavanaucha, which further postponed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet fixed for him. This week could happen, depending on everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, and could be postponed for another week.
We'll see. I always want to make sure you're informed."
Some reporters would argue that Sanders had not convened a White House meeting with the press since 10 September.
The director of the show Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sandersova said that the frequency of meetings is not going to give rise to the "setting up" of TV reporters, but said: "You could not deny that they are putting up."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President conducts more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding without mentioning the source: "We have looked at the numbers."
The meetings will still be held," Sanders said. "But if journalists can turn to the President of the United States with their question, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
This is what we are trying to do and you have seen that we have done this frequently in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference that you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with the public.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared voluntarily and partially bizarre in front of the assembled press.
Letter from the Minister of Health for EU Workers in NHS Scotland concerning the fear of brexity
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working on the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the State and to wish to continue the work on the ground.
Jeane Freeman, SMEs, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom came out from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applying to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the outcome, as I approached the decision this fall.
However, the UK government has also speeded up preparations for a possible outcome scenario without an agreement.
I know this has to be a time of great concern for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff regardless of his nationality.
Members of all the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the hospitals and communities that we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We want to stay here very much."
Christian Abercrombie operated urgently after head injury
The liner of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, was killed by the Vanderbilt Commodores team after a head injury on Saturday morning at 31:27, reported Mike Organ of The Tennesseen magazine.
The chief coach of the State University of Tennessee told reporters that the injury occurred just before half a time ago.
“He came to the edge of the playground and somehow collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel provided Abercrombies with oxygen on the toy before placing it on the towel and taking it from the toy for further inspection.
An official from the State University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that ‘the details of the nature/range of the injury are not yet known’ and that the State University of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently at the university in February, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time after transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five hits together before he left the game, and his total number of hits during the season rose to 18 hits.
A higher tax will be charged to foreign buyers when purchasing real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people in new plans
The momentum will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Increased tax will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The founder expects her to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher rate of tax in the United Kingdom when they purchase properties, and the money will be collected to the homeless, today will be reported by Theresa May.
The move needs to be understood as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to increase taxation for people with high incomes.
Increased tax will be charged to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and will encourage the government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The benefit – which will be charged in addition to the current colloquium, including the increased levels set out two years ago for other homes and real estate for delivery – could be nothing less than three percent.
The Foundation expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by the introduction of the measure.
According to estimates, non-residents of the United Kingdom are expected to buy 13 percent of newly built London property, resulting in a higher price and heavier purchase of first property.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the main city, have become "the places of spirits", as the number of buyers who spend most of their time away from the country increases.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount of money to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
A large construction company charged with rising prices by robbing a country that did not actually use it, and Mr. Mayevo called for a discount for affordable housing to repair the British "refuse of housing".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the monitoring of rents and the completion of forced displacements without mistake.
In addition, he wants to give the city council greater powers to build new homes.
Ms Mayeva said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Minister's leadership to the restoration of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means the correction of our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work here and create their lives.
However, it cannot be true that for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and for foreign companies, the purchase of homes is as simple as for British citizens in garages.
For too many people the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run the Scotland Club"
Chief Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" was once to become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of the North-East club, which currently holds third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-class.
At the Light Stadium, he moved this summer, after St. Mirren took back to the Scottish Championship last season.
"For my country, I wanted to play as a player.
I took the B chapter and that's what Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“Then I grew up observing Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
I would only be offered this opportunity if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors on the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic team, who had previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town offers, said that as an heir of such great names, he did not feel afraid.
“The success of me is measured by the question “Can I take this club back to the First League?”
According to the structure and capabilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the First League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but it’d probably be a success only if the club could take it again.”
Ross is doing the manager's job only three years after he was the assistant leader in Dumbarton and 15 months part of the hearts training staff.
Alloi then helped to prevent the third league failure, and St. Mirren took the lead in the championship championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real breakthrough”, he mentioned taking Alloe.
"I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It's funny to hear because I was a good player, and I've had a relatively good life with it, and I've also achieved some more success.
But the game can become demanding.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
In the sense of stress and pressure at work, I still struggle with this, but management simply feels like the right thing to do for myself.
I've always wanted to run a club and now I'm doing it. In my skin, I feel the most comfortable in my adult life now."

The summer heat increased the income of heavy-duty British pubs, but also increased the pressure on restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, the business adviser of the CGA, who prepared the data, said: “Sustainable solar time and participation of England in the world race, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as in June last month, when the income of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were affected even more.
The fall in traffic in restaurants by 1.8% in June has increased in July.
Trade in pubs and bars with drinks increased in comparison with each other more than traffic in restaurants decreased.
As a result of the sun’s time, sales in pubs offering food in particular have also decreased, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go to a drink.
In different pubs and bars, the sales of alcohol increased by 6.6 per cent in one month and the sales of food decreased by three per cent.’
Paul Newman from the group of analysts for free time and hospitality RSM said: “These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factor in the hospitality market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the 4.8% fall at the Mediterranean level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For locals with food long hot summers, it would not be possible to arrive at more wrong time and only time will tell if recovery will be necessary to bring the moderate temperatures that we experienced in August."
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, indicating the slow introduction of trade marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales criterion in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds and is implemented by an industrial reference.
One of the five children has a secret account on the social network that they hide from their parents
The research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has a secret account on the social network that is hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 slides showed the growth of false Instagram sites
News reinforced the fear of publication of sex-related content
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a ‘main’ account for parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, is actually on social networks the account that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 diaries showed the rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The news reinforced the fear of publication of sex-related content.
Twenty percent of dijacs have said that they manage the censored “main” account shown to parents, but also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into the hidden side of a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter was calling on visitors to send her away.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them acknowledge that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted and create a web space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director of the annual general meeting of the Administrative Committee.
Doyle is the most outstanding Scottish athletes in the field and in the open, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who focus on sport to take advantage of its extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
“Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic communities. We are confident that an athlete in Scotland with her involvement in the committee will gain enormously,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help with sports in Scotland."
An American , who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics from four Olympic medals in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for BBC, has been unable to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I was hit by a drop.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said they'd only tell me if I could get back to life and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I'm running agility exercise!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!’
An ad for a breast pump comparing the mother with cows has divided online opinions
The company producing breast pumps divided opinions with an ad comparing the mother with cows in the mower.
In order to start the market for ‘the first silent portable breast pump’, the consumer technology company Elvie published a provocative music video ad to show mothers all the freedom that the aid can afford.
Four true mothers dance in the sheep cow society, filled with hay, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I’m sucking, but I don’t see any tail,” and “if you haven’t noticed, these aren’t my cuts, these are my tits.”
The collection goes on to say, "Exposure, drain, feed the baby, drain, drain, crush the baby."
But an ad published on Facebook's website has caused considerable harassment on the internet.
At 77,000 surveys and hundreds of comments, he received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said that he was joking about the "great" dairy industry.
"The use of the charge for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they are pregnant and breast-feeding in order to produce milk, but they are being stolen by their babies within the first days of their birth," one wrote.

The other commented: "Of course it is traumatic for both mother and young man.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added: "A voice completely without feeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she thought the song "to be funny".
"That seems like a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt just like a cow when I was sucking.
It's a few crazy ads, but I understood it, just like it was supposed to be.
It's a brilliant product," wrote the other.
Someone commented: “It’s a funny ad that aims at mothers who drain their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing with hidden pumps in the blue.
The concept of action is that many women who are breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and is discreetly attached to the breast-feeding gland, which allows women to move, hold a child, and even activities on the free during milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in mothers, continued to comment. "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation."
With the passage of the parallel between milking women and cows milkers, we wanted to pay attention to the milking of milk and all its challenges, while in a fun way that women can connect, we showed an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump came to the headlines.
During the London week of fashion, the mother of two children walked on the model road for the designer Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of silent migrants moved to a tent tent on the Texas border
The number of children detained migrants has risen sharply, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump’s administration have made it difficult for children to hand over to sponsors.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to be able to stay in the country with the child's request.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to hand out fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Agency, spoke before the congress about arresting more than ten people who were asked to sponsor young people without a warrant.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or home members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are punished foreigners.
That is why we are continuing to search for these individuals," Mr Albence said.
With a view to speeding up the treatment of children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month after they were detained, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers said in the shelter.
Many will show up by videoconferencing, not personally, in order to defend themselves against the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be quickly expelled.
As long as children are in custody, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or escape attempts, following the statements of workers in shelters and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
Protesters said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornill, where children’s symptoms of stress are more likely to remain undetected because of their size.
They added that moving children into a tent town without being emotionally prepared or giving them the opportunity to speak to friends may complicate the trauma many of them face.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech from the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Mouale of Syrian refugees called for return home, even though war had already taken place in the country for eight years.
Moulem, who also carries out the duties of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on the Syrian soil were illegal, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they would "be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem said that the "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave home, " almost finished".
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this world battle until we clear the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United Nations has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Al Asad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this military state.
With regard to the refugees, Mouale said that the conditions were appropriate for their return, and he accused “some Western countries” of “widening unreasonable fears” that the refugees had convinced them to stay abroad.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"They change the political issue, which should be the only humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have assured Syria that it will not receive renewal funds until Asad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampons zone in the last important rebellion of the rebels, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the extensive attacks of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that he had a clear deadline agreement, and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against the jihadist, including fighters from the Nusra Front, associated with Al-Qaido, who would be "rooted".
The envoy of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed by government and opposition members to prepare a proper constitution for Syria and press the way to the elections.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for cooperation in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to "the review of the articles of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will reach second term
After this decision, Mr Trump will win again in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, his presidency will soon end with questioning and scandal.
What would no doubt be "the most dramatic finals of the presidency at any time!"
For now, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s visibility has doubled by more than 1.05 million at the time of the largest viewing, while MSNBC’s visibility has increased by almost 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers, which is more than four years ago after Nielsen, when it was 1.7 million, "The Rachel Maddow Show" on the MSNBC channel reached the largest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on a nightly news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama “Designed Survivor” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a famous song comedy and author of the book “Only funny pieces: and some solid truths about jogging at the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different explanation.
Remember the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd like Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” she told me.
It's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe v. Wad case, whether immigrant families can reunite and health of the global economy.

Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria again.
“Part of his start, which inspires the impression of reality, is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the “Pawn Stars” show on the establishment of Trump’s show and daytime screenplays (dating N.F.L., praise Kim Jong Una).

He could not stand off, nor when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate board and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the air.
“I remember creating all these crazy plays at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is available in preparation for the narrowest interim election
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district, there was a flood of money, since two candidates were in the race for the same seat due to the redeployment of the congressional districts.
This was recently the home of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat at the special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which is heavily covered by the new 17th district.
The cards were quoted again when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of January ruled that the old districts were anti-segregated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The theme in the new 17th district was the fight to finance the campaign between the main foreign financial bodies, the Congressional Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the wide-ranging March special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to Democrats.
In the United States, they were thinking about sanctions against Salvador because of China's support, and then they withdrew.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners lost the leadership of Trump.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to resign US leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to “the recent decisions to stop the recognition of Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, Ministry representative at the beginning of the month.
However, they considered sanctions for Salvador, which was estimated to receive US$ 140 million in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included the restriction of financial aid and the targeted restriction on the issuance of visas, would seriously affect this Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus concluding their thoughts on the punishments for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of giving talks to the participants of the conference, which is now planned for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the US government assigns to the meeting.
After that, three US envoys returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them on an anonymous basis.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government and spoke about it on the basis of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The following unpleasant news could be a report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judicial authority, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's investigation should also focus on whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the attack on the American elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer in advance of this, and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues, at the moment he prepares to speak again to his electors.
There are many questions in this regard and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it his followers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long we could be fighting.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take a blow against Hitler if the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed to miss the opportunity to escape the years of the worship that followed.
Such crossings change the course of history and accelerate or impede the inexhaustible move of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with several of these fractures right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump forgives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a year since this officer reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his incompatibility to this situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of The Times officer was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair or if it is appointed a Supreme Judge despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for the Congress, which will require the responsibility of Mr. Trump?
If we're going to miss these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I'm sure it won't fail us because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who deported her in Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, she immigrated to America, and she ordered me 60 years later to burn a shabby candle on the table with my cousins.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before face-to-face with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that they will be won over the Austrians after an impressive award against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month to put them in a convincing position to qualify from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing in the season for the first time before a 2:2 rhymes against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use it as a space for greater achievement.
“It was a point worthy of us because Villareal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
"We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
Perhaps we could win at the end, but the overall score is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am confident that we can do our best and achieve a positive result.
Last year it has certainly been difficult, given all that has happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I now have a good feeling about this place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
Poor women's sleep due to fear of savings
Even though the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, only a few people would talk to their family members about it.
Half of the respondents to the Nationalwide insurance investigation said they talked to the spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but do not try to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Sector at Nationalwide Insurance.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: Families can't prepare for you if you don't talk to her on time.
Talk to the counselor and the family about where and how you want to receive care, as this may be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term funding may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health representative by setting up a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts will take into account your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the authority of the person for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget about the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is urgently in need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.

Disasters and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials said, and the number of victims was expected to increase.
At the time of the interruption of communications, the rescuers from the Donggal Regent, the area north of Paluja, which is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5, could not receive any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Palu.
Several key data on Palu and Dongali in Slovenia:
Palu is the main city of central Sulavezi, a province that is located at the end of the narrow valley on the western coast of the island of Sulavezi and is expected to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
It reached the province, which extends over 300 km (180 km) to the north-west coast of the island of Sulavezi.
Regents, the administrative unit under the province, were estimated to have 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulavezi are fisheries and agriculture, particularly in the central region of Dongal.
In the province there is also an important activity of mining nickel, which takes place mostly in Moroval, on the opposite side of Sulavesia.
After reporting to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Relief over the past 100 years, Palu and Dongal have been affected by tsunamis several times.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996 the tsunami also affected northern Dongallo and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia is sitting on an excitingly active Pacific fire meal, so the earthquakes are regularly occurring here.
In recent years some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been the following:
2004: More earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries and resulted in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian assessment, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The type of strong earthquakes affected western Sumatra late March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias on the Sumatran coast.
2006: The earthquake of magnitude 6,8 affected the southern part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The magnitude earthquake 7.6 occurred near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: The magnitude earthquake 7.5 affected one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered tsunamis of up to 10 meters, which destroyed the ducate villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake struck the Regent of Pidie Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the tsunamis did not set in, but the buildings fell and more than 100 people died.
2018: More earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held thousands of tourists.
The arrest of Sarah Palin's oldest son due to family violence
Track Palina, the oldest son of the former governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, were arrested for charges of assault.
A 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for the amount of violence in the family, obstructing the application of violence in the family and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report a alleged criminal offence, took the phone from her hand.
The fuel was installed at the Mat-Su Prekassen Foundation and is under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, the KTUU TV network reported.
He appeared at the courthouse on Saturday, where he was said to be "unfortunately innocent", when asked about the objection, the network reported.
The fuel was charged with three violations of Class A, which means that it could be closed up to one year and punished with a depth of $250,000.
He was also charged with a breach of Class B, punishing with one day in prison and depth in the amount of USD 2000.
Fire of crime is not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with violence in the family, interfering with the application of violence in the family and possession of weapons in an alcoholized state in connection with the event.
He said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin criticised the veteran groups when violent behaviour of her son linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tension with tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks have been interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just near central Sulavesia, which lies north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing a moment of earthquake.
When he hit the beach with tsunamis, hundreds of people were detained at the festival in Pala.
Federal prosecutors rarely demand a death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal Prosecutors in New York demand a death sentence for Saifull Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died.
Saipov, 30, was intended to use a rental truck to carry out an attack on the road along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan when he drove several pedestrians and riders in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saipov 's intention to kill eight victims and 'intended' has caused serious bodily harm, is recorded in the notification of the death penalty requirement in the South New York district.
According to the court document, there may be a reason for the death penalty for any of the charges.
For several weeks after the attack, Saipova’s large federal court informed the defendant of the 22 points, which included eight counts of murder in aid for extradition, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for a "significant planning and siege" by prosecutors who described Saipov's way as "sudden, cruel and advanced."
"Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enriquea Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Draka, Ariel Erlia, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damiana Pagnuccoa," is listed in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court of the South District pronounced the last death sentence ten years ago.
Indictees of Khalid Barnes were convicted of murdering two drug addicts, and finally, in September 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty was last pronounced in New York City in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had killed him because of the invasion of the Soviet Union between the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg died on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any regret during the days and months following the attack, following the statements in the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accused, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the video ISIS that he had seen on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said that they asked for an ISIS signal to be released in their hospital room.
According to 22 points of the indictment, he was declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said that they were "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty will be taken instead of a confession of guilt in return for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved only prolonged suffering in relation to these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defence group has asked the prosecutors not to demand a death penalty before this.

The former leader of Ukipa said that politicians need to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics when one of Therese May's own MPs suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone said on a trip to Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "now be outside" if he was the secretary for Mr Farage's break.
But the challenge faced by Mayeva in coordinating its deep-separated species has also been highlighted by the thorists, who have given up on a separate protest against frexity in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his plan in the wake of attacks by Brexitists, Brexit Opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayev in Brussels try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Euroskoptics and Laborists to choose between his package and "caosome".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Department means departure) assembly in Solihulu to "want to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as a spokesperson and assign him the responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in debt, he would have been out by now,” he said.
This member from Wellingborough added, "I'm going to take a break, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU with the following words: "We did not fight in World Wars to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion since the 2016 vote changed: "The idea that the British have changed and want to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic."
At the meeting, there was also the Tory Brexitary Andrea Jenkyns, who told the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Ministry President, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our customers and our activists who are active in the streets and lead us to the election.
Please leave Chequers and start listening’.’
In the message addressed to Mr Mayev, she added: "The Prime Minister maintains his service when he fulfils his promises."
At the meeting, Mr Farage said that policies should be given a ‘hot spot’ if they intend to issue a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to release the brexite, and today we're gathered to tell them, 'We won't let you do this."
In the message, the enthusiastic crowd added: "I want you to let our political class, who is on the subject of the Brexit issue, feel the heat."
"We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has given us victory at the Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the hostages walked through Birmingham, where they had a double meeting in the city center.
After the group was set up this weekend, the Toryci anti-bristy flag was waving.
The Lord Adonis's Labourer tribe laughed at the conservatives due to security problems when using the client's application after opening the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for the Canada agreement plus, for the border without stopping, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good frexit," he added.
Warren's possible pursuit of the president's position will be "exactly studied"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "cooperation in the presidential contest will be carefully studied" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe daily reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warrenov, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will compete for re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation so that it can deal with Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the city hall voters since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to compete for the president's seat.
Warren's answer is that it's time to "make a woman in Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrest after the death of LSU Sims in the shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect on Friday to shoot the LSU Wayd Sims basketball player.
The police station in Baton Roug is news of the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the east time.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the person on the video.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the campus of the South University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and therefore eventually died,” said the police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media, reported the 247sports network.
Wade got involved in protecting a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the end of the incident, that he had a gun and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without objection and taken to police station East Baton Rouge Paris Police Department.
Sims, a 198 centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the last season with 10 starters, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps at the game.
Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion's title, and the team ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettlu
On Saturday it became a moment when Valtteri Boltas qualified before Levis Hamilton, clearly "the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas had a good start in the yard and almost left Hamilton on the dry ground when he defended his position in the first two shifts and invited Vettla to attack his teammate.
Vettel took the first to the box and let Hamilton drive on the transport track, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took him to the box later and left him behind for Vettl, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that the driver of Ferrari's inclination leaves the inside side open and risk that he will remain after two defence moves in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of network and was at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in seventh place.
Then it's a major part of the game of vehicles without a change of noise, as he was going to perform a quick finish, heat up Kimia Raikkonen and occupy a fourth place.
In the box he finally took to the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase speed, so the fourth seat was Raikkonen.
It's a hard day because Valtteri's a fantastic vehicle all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he let me out.
The team has done a really great job to reach the first and second places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speaker.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diana Feinstein at the meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not reveal Christine Blasey Ford, who was the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, charged with sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate's investigation commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "sick, corrupt and false".
"The only beautiful thing that can happen that happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are mean, corrupt and false," he said.
"When you look at the revelations and the revelations, people say, 'No, I didn't do it'."
I didn't do that."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer... you discovered the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it.'
Okay, hold on a second.
We discovered him... no, we didn't," he added the impression about the senator.
Fordova sent a letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the media was disclosed in early September – but Feinstein denied that it had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusation, I didn’t disclose her letter,” The Hill Feinstein’s officer told the Commission after reporting.
"She asked me for trust, and I kept her as trusted as she asked."
Her refusal apparently did not match the president who said at a meeting on Saturday night: "I tell you, it was a really bad speech.
It may not be true, but it was the worst speech I've ever seen."
In defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of improper sexual conduct, the president suggested that democracy abuse the charges for its own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You have seen evil, hatred, no concern about who is affected and who has to be driven to fight for power and control," the president said after the Mediaite website was reported.
Elitna league: Dundee Stars v. Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two goals for the Great Against Dundee.
Dundee Stars were redeemed for a Friday's loss in the elite league against Belfast Giants with a win at a Saturday match in Dundee at 5:3.
Giants were told early on two goals at Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Beauvilleer's hits.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were on the same side as home, and then Dwyer regained the advantage of Giants.
Francois Bouchard was a match for Dundee before two naked Lundvald Nielsens won their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elith League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee from the back on Friday night at 2:1.
This was the fourth season season between teams, during which the Giants won in the previous three matches.
Dwyer reached his first goal in the game in four minutes at 3:35 at Kendall McFaull's assistant, Beauvilleer, who won four minutes later, and gave up David Rutherford.
In the intensive introduction at 13:10 Sullivan again took home the game, and Matt Marquardt gave Cownia an equation at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the management of the Giants on vacation when at the end of the first third he scored his second goal of evening.
The domestic side was gathered again, and Bouchard rewarded the remnant with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped together with Nielsen to take advantage of Dundee at the end of the second third and to make sure to win the fifth goal of his team half-third and to win the fifth goal of his team.
The giants, who have lost four of their last five games now, will play the next game on Friday home in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller, with his death, enabled more than a hundred people on the plane to escape the earthquake
The air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as a hero, after sacrificing his life so that a plane with more than a hundred people could fly safely.
In the Friday earthquake on the island of Sulavezi, which followed his tsunamis, more than 800 people died, and many are missing.
The area continues to be under stress by powerful thunderstorms, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Paul.
Although the employees fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung did not leave his workplace in a strong rolling control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained in it so that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flight path, could safely fly.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was climbing.
He died later in the hospital.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision might have saved more than a hundred lives, reported the Australian Media House ABC News.
We set up a helicopter to take him to a larger hospital in another town from Balikpapan in Kalimantan.
Sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our hearts are in the market when we hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could be achieved more than a thousand, as the State's disaster relief agency has said that access to towns in Dongala, Sigia and Boutonga is limited.
“The number of dead is expected to increase, as many bodies have been destroyed and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
The Pala, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the rescue vehicle brings the body.
There's no clean water.
The retail markets have been robbed all over the world.’
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is coming to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy that can become much worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo arrived in Pala, Indonesia, and told the national army: "All of you, please, work night and day to fulfill all the duties associated with evacuation.
Are you ready?» After reporting CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that one man misses one man after the plane has been hit by a plane.
The airline, which operated the flight that was headed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says they are missing one man after initially reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini announced on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger is missing.
The airline reported that the missing person was involved in the search with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
A call for more information about a passenger, such as his age or nationality, did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped to rescue other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water when they tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the officials said they took seven people to the hospital.
The airline said that there were eight passengers who were all in stable condition at the hospital on Saturday.
The cause of strangulation and the exact order of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane arrived in the cabin just before the road.
Some of the witnesses said that the plane was missing a gun.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had dropped very low.
“That’s extremely good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers had managed to pass through a stream of running water to power outputs on a diving plane.
He said that the stewardess panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the mariners who were near repairing the aid were also helped by using an inflatable boat that led people to the ground before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people died in the last two decades of air accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst set the time at night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented its evidence on Saturday in a retrial to a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The US Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received information about the location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night before her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported Officer The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he said he was with a friend of Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "laughing because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The video on the phone shows that they only met for one week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers died on his phone, Tellis erased Chambers' texts, phone calls, and contact details.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence is supposed to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury should judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What's a Conscious hippop?
Hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group in Bristol claims that the hippop has distanced itself from the original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and re-make a conscious hippope popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons recently experienced a new rise with artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black?
The New York Guard sues a couple because they fired her because of a "racist" message
The New York Guard sues a couple because they discriminated against her after receiving the wrong message sent by the mother, who complained that she was "one black."
A few reject the racist behaviour and the complaint compared to "exercising".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when at the arrival of the new guard, Giselle Maurice, she found that she was black.
‘NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ČNKA,’ she wrote in her message to her husband, Plasco-Flaxman.
But instead of sending him to his husband, she sent him to Mr. Maurice twice.
After finding out what she was doing, the Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “uncomfortable”, said Maurice’s forgiveness, saying that her outgoing guard, who was an African-American, was doing a bad job, so he wanted to hire the Philippines, reported Officer New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a payment for one day's work, and then she and Uber were sent home.
Maurice is now demanding compensation from a couple in court of USD 350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was first hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, such things don’t happen,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the charges of racism, claiming that Maurice's forgiveness was reasonable, for they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children to whom you were disobedient, even if that happened because of the wrongs?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.’
When comparing the complaint to ‘immigration’, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
"Will you be proud of someone like that?
This is not nice," the investment bank added.
Although the procedure before the Court is still under way, the Court of Public Opinion is a couple on social networks because of its conduct and the way in which it thinks quickly.
The publishers of the fairy tales of Paddington were afraid that readers would not associate with the talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said about the letter: “It was hard to put in the skin of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an outstanding success."
She said that her father, who first worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before he was inspired to write a children's book on small bear toys, was bitter when he refused his work, added that after his death last year she was the 60th anniversary of the book "Green-Sweet".
With regard to Paddington’s bear, described as “a very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“It was those people who didn’t like to praise,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You’re proud of him, even though you don’t really do it yourself.
I think that in the success of the Paddington bear, he looked in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, success has always been attributed to the bear Paddington himself.’
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon their arrival, her daughters were taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteurija 2 in Nice, where doctors of time tried to preserve her life.
“Now she regularly called to say that she really felt bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got Nad's call. He told me that in the next two minutes she was going to die, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping, slowly took it and left her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position to be surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperous, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the trials she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I've had my head turned off, and all the time I've had tears in my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women's sticky posters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one in suicide try to turn others away from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valiant Bridge stick posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mr. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want you to feel like I do every day for any parent,” she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room."
But before he died, he stopped working because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found the fellow when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am so worried that a domino effect will be triggered."
Ms. Davis made posters "to let other people know that people you can turn to and talk to are available, even if they are friends.
Do not sit quietly – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who was Davies' friend for several years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He did not say that he felt sweaty, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he did not establish an eye contact with them or something similar."
She said that his death was a serious injury to them, but they had to process it: “She cut the hole into the entire family.
She broke us up.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugha all at the beginning of the FBI Air Investigation
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – after the duration and extent of a limited investigation, this might be a bit confusing,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would be "disappeared" due to a strong foreign presence.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
Until the mid-elections that will take place on 6 November, only five weeks more – if the Republicans, as expected, are cut short, will make them very weak in trying to elect the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senator several times to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, who was introduced by his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI is preparing a report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate can gather at least 50 votes, which would have brought a break from the same position and election to the Supreme Court by Mike Pence.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came into power seven years ago, the South Korean envoy said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to the data from the South Korean Association Ministry, said that last year, 1127 people survived, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factor was more stringent border control between North Korea and China and an increase in the price required by people's thiots.
Pjongang hasn't commented in public yet.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossed.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a highly secured demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees for illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
In the early part of this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the suspension of the negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kimo Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for a Korean nuclear-weapon-free half.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho gave the US sanctions a stop since then.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be disillusioned unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in a statement by the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Kavanaugha as “historic” and said that it was not appropriate for the service at the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the representative's home, Nancy Pelosi, appointed the candidate for the Bretta Kavanaugha Supreme Court as a "historic" and said that he was significantly inadequate for the service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosijeva did so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than that a woman, if she knew so, would be marked “histories”,” Kavanaugh’s fourth statement in front of the Senate investigation commission commented on Pelosijev.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, he was almost inflamed at times, and was breathing during discussion about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Commission and pointed out the charges against himself for "grossy and coordinated fading" organised by the liberals, because Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 at the presidential elections.
Pelosijev said that he felt that the Kavanaugh's story had proved that he should not be appointed a Supreme Judge, since it showed that he was biased to the Democrats.
"I believe that such statements and the way in which the Clintons and Democrats have fled have been discredited," she said.
Pelosij's question is whether he will try to bring a constitutional indictment against Kavanaugh, if he is confirmed and democracy will get most of it in the House of Representatives, for the moment.
“I will say so – if the Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court at which it is now,” Pelosiev said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosijev said that, as a democratic concern, Kavanaugh’s decision against the Act on Access to Health Care or Roe’s case against Wada was considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether to annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Is that not wonderful?'," Pelosiev said.
And they have to take him to the woman's house.
It's a fair outcome, after months and years of anger, and it can't express it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," she told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem rare to me, what do you think?"
She continued: “She was very helpful to me, a woman who was a director who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which was when she got angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said, ‘I may feel sorry for you because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was great."
The tears are partly allowed as an exit for anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful early career memories, when I was still working in a office where men were in control, when I was once crying in unresolved anger, was an event when an older woman grabbed me at the door — a cold leader, who was always a few balls that dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They won't understand that you're angry.
They will think you're sad, and they'll be happy to touch you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, cooperated with Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was ambushed by a boat in a boat named Monkey Business and had to leave the game, Ms. Schroeder found out that there was no reason why she could not run for the president alone.
“This was not a well thought-out decision,” she said 30 years later in a laugh.
"There have been seven other candidates involved in the match and one more was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone named the match “Snegučica and seven thumbs” at that time.”
Since the campaign joined the last, she was left behind to collect funds, so she decided that she would not join the game unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave the man $1,000 gave her just $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced that she would not start the official campaign, her feelings — gratitude to the people who supported her, discontent with the system, which made it so difficult to collect money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger because of sexism — prevailed so that she began to breathe.
“They would think I had a nervous breakdown,” she said. Schroederje mentioned media reactions.
"They'd think my official sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my graveyard.
“But was she crying?”
How could war between the United States and China use Beijing?
The initial peace of trade between the United States and China was listening, and even though the battle has not yet ended, experts say that the gap between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which effectively represents the taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has always been guilty of equivalent reimbursement measures, lastly with tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent for US goods worth US$ 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to moving her eye out of the United States and is likely to not get involved soon.
In order to give up Washington, China would have to comply with its demands, but the public removal of the United States for China's President Shi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing knows how to pull the right moves, US pressures in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China in order to reduce the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic turmoil in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far," said Abigail Grace, an expert collaborator focusing on Asia at the brain trust Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, true foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in the reconstruction of the country, abandoned in more than seven years of war.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to repair areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
Now all the conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survival have been met.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Serbs have escaped from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said he would welcome the Syrian regime's help in rebuilding the desolated state.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe won a victory in Ryder's Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and Ryder's Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the championships, got a ball into the water at the 16th hole in a couple of 3 games at his initial strike, which was why he had to hand the game to Francesco Molinaria.
Italian golfers Molinari shined through all circles and became one of the four players who have ever achieved the result 5-0-0 since the start of the championship in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth won the lowest-ranking European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark with 5 and 4.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who might have played in Ryder's kiss the last time.
The veteran of the eight Ryder races, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the most powerful European player at the top of all times.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
This year it was hard.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we won the pod again.
It's a team and I'm really glad to be able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The staff handed over to John Rama, who won the American golf course of Tiger Woods on Sundays 2 and 1 in the games of individuals.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods in France lost all four games he played, and now has a career record in Ryder's round 13-21-3.
This is unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 great titles right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been trying hard all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing golf at high level all the time.
The American captain said after a bad performance for his team, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we pressed a few pressure on Europe for a moment.
We missed it.
The club's down before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to get together again, I'm going to work with the U.S.P.A. and our Ryder Room Committee, and we're going to move on.
I really like these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Get down.
They have overpowered us."
