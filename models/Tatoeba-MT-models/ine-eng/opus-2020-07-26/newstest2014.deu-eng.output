Good: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian platform was launched at the village park - in view of the older town hall.
Two systems are similar: intention or citizenship?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The council building was installed at that time because it secured the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser amp ensures both bikers and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The plant officially operated yesterday was important for the cross section Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grubâ.
"In the case of high traffic and pedestrians, their safety required a further lamp," says Eckert.
Peter Arnold from the Offenburg Landratsamt.
"The municipality of Gutach is about 12,000 vehicles per day, about 10 percent of which carry heavy loads, according to current measurements at B 33," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp is more than necessary: "Security is just ahead," said Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, also a circuit was considered, but because of the narrowness in the cross section of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was rejected.
According to Arnold, when choosing the spot of the amplers, it was first tested: "The means of an extra for us with particularly long wooden loads loaded carriers have tested whether these vehicles can go from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without changing the amplers".
The approximately EUR 15 000 expensive lamp system itself is the "modernest thing on the market at the moment," Arnold explained.
The installation is equipped with colourful LEDs, which so strongly lit that the lights from the drivers are also well recognized in the deep sun for example.
And it's also cheap: The older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new one just eight watts.
There are three light systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the lamp button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic impact.
If the road is free, immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people go over the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the drivers have to think here as partners and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the lamp for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle blew through - at bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the languagelessness, the addiction to calm violence and stupid sexuality, the anguish and joylessness - have often been described by the karntner poet.
The bookkeeper is known primarily as prosa author, theatre texts are rar in his work.
Collage of Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Weather at the Zungspitze", which is now seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prosatexts.
The theatremaker combines some elements from the autobiographically marked novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosams from "Leichnam, his family rewarding" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requirement: a velvety sofa, on which it is embellished and masturbated, depends the eight-headed ensemble through the text material.
In this case, Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers the template with a full range of direct events known from the repository of post-dramatic games.
In particular, the actresses come to the bottom with some interesting scenic implementations.
They are caught hard, with the head dived under water, with their draining on the wall.
Forced in cellophane or midwifery, they stick to dangerously high pieces through the stage, either monologizing loud or lying completely on the stage floor.
The text, however, is not in a position to do so.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth is enough from Deep Purple to folk music.
In the end, the transverse performance is a bit of peace, and Winkler's after-sudden humour turns up.
A blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in every car's storage board.
The devices, which record every kilometre of danger and report the information to the authorities, are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The rather boring area of road planning has suddenly led to an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Liberals have joined environmental groups and express themselves that the government can use the small boxes to record the dangerous kilometres – and possibly even where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax fees.
The Tea Party is disappointed.
The U.S. Civil Law Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while you cannot agree to a move at the Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system during the next ten years, where the driver pays per dangerous mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we can only use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who has planned a record of the dangerous miles of all California drivers in the state since 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that US-Americans are making on the zapfs column, is ready.
But in America, no more is thought of as much as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax at high prices even to raise a cent.
"The fuel tax is simply not future," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His federal state recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a miles-based payment system.
"This is the long-term most meaningful alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in the case of urban liberals, for example, that tax has to be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce emissions and greenhouse gases.
The California Planners set the system in the process of developing strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the Federal State for climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Schuster from Pennsylvania, president of the House Transport Committee, also stated that he saw the longest possible long-term alternatives.
The Free Marketers of the Reason Foundation are also made up of the idea of allowing drivers to pay for a return route.
"This is not tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Reasons.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in a 2011 report called on the Congress to move in the direction of an abbreviation based on an abbreviation.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project involving 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the initiative and reacted to the concerns of representatives from rural areas who often have to leave many miles on their way to work or to the city.
Several states and major cities do not move at all on their own foot in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mill fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also thinks of such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, to which the Ministers of Transport of 17 states belong on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical in thinking that the government could pursue any of their movements.
“Regarding Big Brother and such things were a major problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management in Nevada’s Ministry of Transport.
The people didn't want it.
When the test began, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, impervious technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to record data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can capture the risk kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
That, like Khan, would also make the public calmer.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially come to help the federal states in taxing drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take a step in an emerging market for Kfz insurance, where drivers would pay on the basis of the risk miles.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, major errors were made.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a break fee on the basis of the average mile taken by all residents of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxing device with which parking charges can also be paid, insurance must be paid only for dangerous kilometres and speed data from other vehicles can be collected in real time, thanks to their driver’s staus.
"Car drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate," says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder if the whole thing about paying per mile is not just a huge departure manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that the congress could simply solve the problem of the red Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or annual fee could be charged to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough," explains Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislation and public affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers take care of their privacy and many other things.
King's Field: Little team beats up
The Voluntary Firearm raped her autumn main sample despite lack of personnel with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Commander Hans Kammmerer had chosen the estate of the Feder in the Burgberger Straße in his admission.
There was to be a brief conclusion when we saw it.
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoke development, one of which was able to send an emergency.
Two air carriers of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building after the first examination of the case by Hans Kammmerer.
In a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead them to freedom.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, since it was also a narrow step to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stabilization for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There were lots of wood and straw balls in it.
There were still electrical machines for wood processing.
The first discharge was taken over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made through a superfluous hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Now three solvents could be formed.
There was also a hollow beam tube in the building.
Hans Kammmerer also went on to show in the exercise what is to be done with the little available personnel.
In the event of a serious case, a support will be provided through the Kingsfeld Day Use Group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and firms
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt of where the workers came from tomorrow.
In the centre of funding, Hochschwarzwald met with the managing school leaders of the vocational schools and the circuit gymnasium and the chairmen of the parental council of this important issue.
"Building is an important local factor", stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma school, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre in the forest city.
He also praised family hospitality in the countryside.
"It is important to have not only the family phase in view, but also because of the demographic change the phase to care for the care of family members," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more people were caring for the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the employer's support, the resulting burden on the employees can lead to the termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"Because who has already learned the advantages of the region during his study, his acquired knowledge and skills are often gained from the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the President of the Landday.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered can the technical needs be met.
In his opinion, the local advantage of the county is its beneficial location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced on his train from Titise-Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Keep working hard and make public transport better," he explained to the address of the local politicians in place.
With music experience a entertaining afternoon
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has invited the dieting seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
Earlier, the older citizens were arrested in the Rastststätte.
In the meantime, this afternoon will take place in the Pflegeheim St. Josef.
The natives were happy with the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
With common melodies Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich.
Over 100 years old natural stone walls are to be reintroduced to the city of Brăunlingen by the old schoolhouse before the renovation.
In the days before Kilbig, a small corner wall was built for stabilization and static discharge of the natural stone wall with Balustrade in the first work of repairing the former schoolyard.
The next step is that Alexander Misok, from the Brăunling City Building, will involve the Landesdenkmalamt in planning and create a repair concept for the old wall.
Then a cost calculation will be carried out by experts, who will then be placed on the table to decide and determine the further action.
A decision on this is expected to fall already in the coming year.
After the renovation, planting and planting of the old schoolyard within the two sides of the school built in 1912, the necessary renovation walls must be repaired and refurbished in due course as a follow-up measure.
The historical, one hundred years old wall of demarcation of the old school yard to the Church Street is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, necessary for recovery and has a bogneging forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones cause weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger.
A more stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use a school yard, which is done by the current fixation works.
Originally, school management was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall construction, which has already been used for films, will be addressed by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If requirements come from this site, then the city of Brăunlingen hopes for grants from the memorialists.
The students of the Brăunling primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-furnished old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Greens, has now become involved.
"I think it's wrong to give up the whole training at the Stuttgart Music School," Özdemir said the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classics are part of the Jazz site Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who is regarded as a favourite in Stuttgart as a direct mandate at the Bundestag elections on 22 September, is opposed to the Green-Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this enforces a reorganization of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the students Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music School to the Mannheim Music School.
US limit: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, inventors discovered and shut down a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail lines and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the data, the tunnel has not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid, if they think they could dig through under the radar," said U.S. Attorney General Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a camphouse in San Diego, where this was discovered at the end of the tunnel.
Turned to drugs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such a tunnel and try to use it, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a lasting fight against drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by Experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year.
The rail system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is located in a building 80 meters away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the accused Marihuanas.
All three are threatened as a maximum penalty for lifelong freedom, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually, cocaine is washed in small quantities and not by tunnel.
This shows the "development" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have been cut off in the meantime, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug gang in San Diego.
They'd do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the prisoners, at least one six Mexicans, it was said.
You have to count on prison sentences for up to ten years.
2014 becomes Geisinger Feast
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Returning to the first official reference is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in good eight weeks, the anniversary year will come.
Geisingen and Church Houses were first mentioned in writing.
In churches, a copy was produced, in which both places were mentioned.
On 15 March, there will be an official event for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event will take place in the place where the two were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be held in July at a weekend from 18 to 20 July in 1250.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a holiday, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
Also on this weekend is the church-house church feast.
The city music director Rudolf Barth wrote a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the sun-winding festival of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new Festival Hall.
This will be completed and dedicated in the Year of Jubilee, the official date is the last weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle will also be issued.
"But it should become not only a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which is made up of Geisingen, Church-Houses, Leipzig, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's Geising celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the municipalities.
The new Chronicles will then be presented at the new Festival Hall in Geisingen on November 21 or 22.
But 2014 is also another year with many Jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on February 8th with a breakfast evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and has the feast banquet on March 29th, and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The old opera Leipzig will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been in the new place for 50 years and will celebrate it on 10 May, the music association Polyhymnia Leipzig will be 150 years old and celebrates it in the framework of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The paper was produced in churches (houses), which was then a courtroom.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Due to 2014 this 1250-year-old celebrates, in addition the municipal reform remains 40 years.
Council takes tile installations into the viscera
Whether the "To Do" transition should be repeated continuously to increase the safety of the traffic
Yes, the municipalities have decided.
Schiltach has to take over 220,000 euros for this.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway route in the coming year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of railway crossings - regularly it comes to collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must take part in the costs of a third party, and the rest share railway and freight.
Schiltachs Stadtbameister Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality the particulars of the crossing "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build an exploding out at the height of the tunnel mundane west of the railway track.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwoods, when they are on the road, without having to block the rails.
Therefore, Grißhaber proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could expand the road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed in the community controversy, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp expressed the attitude of critics on the point: "Should we take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area will be transported partly through this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Haverles bridge, because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a route for those vehicles which may not use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, argumented Haas.
In view of the fact that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel must be rebuilt and repaired, as is currently the case in Wolffak, it could also be important for a longer period of time for the "Hirschen" train crossing.
The Council agreed to examine the costs of the alleged expansion of the road.
Notwithstanding this, it was largely agreed that the necessary support walls would be built so that the city could expand the road to the next direction "Bahnhofstraße" if necessary for road traffic to approximately 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the redevelopment of the train passage at Gerbei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem involving access to the highly rising "Geroltzhauser road".
The administration had examined the refurbishment plans of the railway from the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhausen road was still possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not to be excluded that the traffic conditions could lead to longer vehicles.
In turn, the city is responsible for this.
The refurbishment could thus lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood transport and the bending functioned in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the rail crossing, argued Haas.
At this point too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the crossing is significantly lower than that of the other trains, because there is also the centre of the stop point to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main railway station had to be stopped in this place so far that no collision was threatened.
Mostly, the conversion of this crossing was denied approval, as the town of Schiltach had to "exhaust" the problem with sitting vehicles, so the councils, as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the completion of the construction works.
As unproblemically, the board considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which cross-border agreements have already been concluded with the railway.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from European space travel agencies now have to agree on two major projects they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
Far from the world.
More than 1,000 planets have already found astronomers on other stars.
If there's at least some of it alive, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Search for gravitational waves
Or would you like to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or do they go to such planets to discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are directly addressed to the European Space Agency Esa.
For her "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will be crucial for research.
The state of such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas for debate, five of which have now come to the narrowest choice.
Numerous bodies examined the proposals, hooked up with the researchers.
In the coming days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions has been chosen by the Esa to find answers to the missions of the 2007 "Cosmic Vision" programme.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise processes of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the verbal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, in 2017, the space telescope "Cheops" will start to explore more closely the 500 known planet systems in our closer surroundings.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could paint similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an index of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also to be considered in the final analysis of what are the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation from it with the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined by example.
With the Solar Orbiter, the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) on this issue.
The probe will start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun exactly.
Jupiter and his moon are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
To this end, the Esa is the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is going to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the irony world of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The World All offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into existence, and why did it exist?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the urknal.
In addition to the ongoing matter, from the stars, planets and living things like us, there is dark matter, the gravity of which consists of galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the urn, nor where dark matter and dark energy existed.
With "Euclide", the Esa has already approved an M-mission, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the whole sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race?
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa" has the best chance of obtaining an L-Mission authorization, a demanding concept for evidence of gravitational waves.
Among these, physicists understand changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three probe detector that is stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on the earth, it could also prove gravitational waves created by the urn and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competing for the second L-Mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate such planets.
Proposals for sample transport from Mars, for the exploration of moons, venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics, have already been made.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US Secret Service, has stated that he is ready to travel to Berlin and speak before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received this asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin, she writes: “Even though the result of my efforts has proved to be positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of trust and tries to criminalize political opinion with a threat of punishment, where no defense is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to leave the charges against him.
The charges raised by the US Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said regarding time online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to do so."
The relationship between the United States and Germany is charged with the claims that the NSA has stopped the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the honourable Member, who is leading the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the Secret Service, explained that it was time to take the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness, if this is possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a Green MP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the former NSA employee's lawyer Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden speaks in Germany, he needs to make sure that he is “safe” there, so the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he is exposed to a "serious and ongoing" campaign of persecution that drove him out of his home.
However, he was affected by the global reaction to 'my act of political opinion'.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – also in the United States – have referred to the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive supervision as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation "when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines collects fees for handbags
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to steal handbags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of handbag and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if it was to be read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the entire dose.
The new fee applies to handbags in the bag over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that you would charge $25 when the fee was paid in advance, and $100 in the case of travellers who only paid on the flight path.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the $100-dollar fee is intended to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she said.
Air carriers began in 2008 to demand charges for the first and second items given.
Passengers who tried to handle these have therefore stopped as much as possible in the hand luggage, which has the effect that the luggage bags are often overcrowded over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said at the new fee, it's not really about making money.
It is about the most trusted customers of Frontier who had clearly expressed that it would be harder to find a place in the box over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the company's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight path from Frontier may carry a luggage free of charge, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable luggage.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed, so that passengers were informed about the fee before they arrived at the airport.
Frontier's new handbag fee only enters into force in the summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often cheat on baggage charges and other charges, but airlines are happy to get back on it.
They argue that the transportation of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many on the Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far left the fingers of hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed three years ago as the first fee for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air followed, as well as a flight ticket.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully followed the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the handbag fee is 50 million US dollars a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious what he would expect on the flight path if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most smooth things I've ever experienced in my career on the air," he said.
I expected to see dental discussions and handcuffed discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding went like a sham."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers, who bought lemonade or juice, should keep the whole dose and be filled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried in 2008 to demand money for refreshment drinks, but this turned back seven months later, after passengers had been harassed and no other large company had been pursued.
Frontier's step in raising fees for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to connect customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase with them instead of via an online travel office.
However, borderier has gone the best in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half of the number of flying miles when booking via an online travel office.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut again to 25 percent of the flight path.
A flight ticket booked by a third party with a border of more than 1000 miles therefore only 250 miles will be introduced.
Passengers can also book directly on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a loyal customer tribe at his seat in Denver, but the business is shrunk and the company loses money.
The return went back by 9 percent and the flight capacity dropped almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as in the financial report, which was published by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
The Republic has tried to get Frontier's finances in the hands of the company as part of its sale.
Words From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "Bible Words" and "Middle Age Talks".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, followed the breakfast in a talk on the Bible’s words.
"Speakers contain life instructions, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several words to the corresponding Bible verses and explained the meaning.
She called words like: "Be careful how the eyes fall, throw an eye on someone, His eyes are in the Lord's sleep, wash his hands in innocence."
On several occasions the rapporteur also advised her listeners about what speech it was.
The speeches from the Middle Ages, the Church Department Christel Dehner, accepted: All good things are three, blue, something to eat.
She explained the significance and origin of the speeches she called "the bridges of the past".
To finish, a tomola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humidly described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, the mayor's candidate Roman Waizenegger was also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for young people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburg Lake Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as undergraduates in the industry are expected to be qualified as professionals for hotels and hostels over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Labour Agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would fight trained professionals who are increasingly lacking in hotels and hostels, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chambers of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel & Hospital Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hacker is the blame on the site's crash
The shadowy National Security Agency stated on Friday, an error has put its public website a few hours ago and not hacker, as was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not reachable for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update”, explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers were found that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and that is still not available for some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, so the speaker.
At least one group of hackivists claimed to have placed the NSA website with a DDOS attack.
In the event of such attacks, the target website will be overflowed with page tippings until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to interfere with the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose top name was No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the light of the public and is seen in the light of the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance programme in the country and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA staff Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service led to initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted Cyprus operation.
The number of people without jobs decreased slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy business manager of the work agency in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have reacted to behaviour in settings.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Builder: "We have hardly any specialists in handwork, health and care".
Year-to-year offers have been in place since September for staff in the hotel and hotel business.
In mid-December, the winter season begins there.
The full background report for this is available in the Allgäuer advertikbätt 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Earnings at Bombardier after downtime on delivery and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and railways Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decrease in net profit after he had been under pressure by late orders and deliveries to third-quarter aircraft as well as contractual problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also published no flight deadlines for his new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in the next September in accordance with the ambitious schedule.
Only three other start-ups have been followed on the juvenile flight of the test aircraft half a month ago, which seems to be a matter of whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the projections and led to a course shift of more than eight percent at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reviewed his assessment of "outperform" on "sector performance" on Thursday in order to ensure that the stock has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although poorer delivery rates have been widely expected for aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the marginal development in the transport sector," Duerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the pilot program for the aircraft advances.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CS series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented in March to the public and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
However, binding orders for the CSeries are still modest, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and would like to see if the company's claims regarding the fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new diesel vehicle are relevant.
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured the analysts and media on Thursday, and the program is in the schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft's stand-by time was running ground tests and software updates.
Every manufacturer has a different plant.
We have decided to take the first flight and then to attach a period of processing, as we have done.
This happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest of which was called from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether they can operate a C series aircraft 12 months after the first customer's flight.
Bombardier explained that it will review the implementation planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow advance of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to Bombardier’s internal planning – strengthens our view that the start-up shifts to the first quarter of 2015,” Derksen said.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30th, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share a year before.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
The turnover increased slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The mandate in the Air and Space Department amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September and was unchanged compared to 31 December.
"In the area of air and space travel, the results were disappointing in terms of our standards, but the low level of demand and the overall market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Turnover in the air and space segment fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area increased by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The commission in the Transport Party amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September and was slightly increased compared to 31 December.
The volume of profits in the field of transport has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to the management of the company, new standards will be introduced for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon's trade on Thursday, the Bombardier shares accounted for 8.5% and stayed at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that the Google Finance Manager Patrick Pichette will change to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier fiercer rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (location time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport manager announced on the short notice service Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times", the man was dead.
A security man was killed, too.
The media also reported on several victims.
U.S. President Barack Obama was constantly informed of the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3 eye samples to have seen a shield with a gun in one of the vents, as several media reported.
A traveler told the CNN sender, many people had been looking for in panic protection.
Travelers had screamed and crying children.
Among those waiting was panic broke out, many had been hiding out of fear behind chairs.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security authority suffered a gunshot wound at foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
Then he was taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots should be close to a safety control area.
Evacuated airport building
There were numerous hospitals and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special application command and a weapon lying on the ground.
The event began at 9.30 a.m. (place time) as reported on Twitter.
The access routes were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in long recovery.
Until landings were temporarily suspended, it was said.
However, several flights were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine Addict, who warned the drug boss of police investigation, must be in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information on the subworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal, who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug search could be discovered, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The criminal lawyer named Bash was arrested in his home in 2011 after the Scarborough police had monitored him in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and his colleagues were at a meal in the lawyer's chamber.
The findings added that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after finding traces of cocaine in his hair, in his pocket and in credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine at 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash in a series of household investigations.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the office of Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two counts because of the injustice of justice.
He gave the cocaine possession in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and lay the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf shoe under the lawyer's gun tone.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly called with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It was announced before the court that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs of Class A in his hair, letter bag and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but opposed to taking cocaine and said that he had spoken to the moderate dealer because he was his mandate, and claimed that his discussion was subject to the "tutor's secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his letter bag and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken to him.
In the course of a police investigation, he indicated that he would operate both under his private address and at the workplace an office and that he would be called home for legal matters.
It was announced before the Court that he had called for significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them.
Lawyer Anne Whyte said: “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you do not break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender, since he has been too busy with certain mandates.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between the lawyer and the mandate.
He acted against police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta has thus brought his professional status to a standstill.
He was too close to certain mandates, especially Scarborough, and he suggested that his independence was compromised.
Ditta pointed out every misbehaviour and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the time he started to acquire drugs from organised criminals."
His dependence on cocaine led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to collect valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and trust.
Ditta has lost this trust and is trying to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the lack of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to trial.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Fifty others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to 153 years' imprisonment for drug trafficking.
On his website Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent as an attorney for the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and chance inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To complete the celebrations due to its 160-year-old existence, the song cross Dunningen is framed by two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which inspired the audience this spring, the song will enrich two services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10.15 a.m. in St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Sings to the celebration of the Holy Victim of the Messe", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of his birth.
The fair will be presented in the framework of the services of God, as directed by Johann Philipp Neumann meant.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the blast group of the Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skeptics tends to look familiar
With the elections to the parish community in 2015, for example, Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is then only one common parishioner for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welchensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the basic decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is for the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the sceptsis towards the new is slowing down, but with a view to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish community, the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main officers of the soul body team were held.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for mental care units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
Then, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a common parish council and a founding board in which the parishioner is represented by the Power of the Office.
Of each parish, at least two elected members are to be represented, in which six parishes are formed on-the-spot community teams.
Your task will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the place.
On the question of the finances of the individual parish community, there was then a significant need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected goods remain in the parishes for use.
On the other hand, the obligations go to the general community.
It was precisely with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then met all parishes, that there was great concern.
"Even in the past, it was only invested in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said Mr. Bruno Prinzbach, president of the parish.
Practical experience with a joint board for five parishes, Barbara Ritter, chairman of the board in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made 2006 the task of "being one, stay five" and had to find that it was not that simple.
The bodies of the Haslacher soul care unit were then asked to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the Joint Pharm municipality as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concrete in further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies in the spring.
At the end, Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was agreed by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the manager of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, comes to a four-head Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 Euro extra charge per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC deposit from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This conversion will be re-established every October by the four operators of the major currents.
These refer to the additional costs they incur from the energy exchange, which they can raise by a conversion over the electricity price.
The City Works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The Energy Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even emerged from a higher environment in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the concrete payments had to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going from a 1 cent plus x increment," says Bias, where the number will be closer to the 2 cents.
Lamp on permanent red: Eight on waiting time
Sometimes a lamp just won't be green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do then - drive to red?
If a person has waited long enough for a red lamp and the crossing is free, he can proceed, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The waiting time, however, must be "accepted", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before leaving a malfunction of the lamp.
However, if the journey continues despite red light, it must be clear that it is due to an accident caused by it to bear the full blame.
If the patient is less than five minutes, under circumstances not long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court Hamm.
In the case negotiated, a driver had ignored the lamp after about three minutes of permanent redness and had to be responsible for a sudden red light failure.
The lamp was not defective, but little later turned to green.
A road ban was spared because of the special situation - but not the money penalty.
Community is happy about a solid budget
Whenever it comes to municipal meetings about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal shelter in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts are no longer known to the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be seen as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million over this approach.
The surplus is mainly higher tax revenue and the share of income tax in the Community.
The wealth budget was again clearly about the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially the higher delivery from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
As less investment has been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the reduction in the return is also higher.
Overall, the overall deficit could now be increased by around €2.1 million to €4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"It's not just a piece of work from the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual bill.
He and the locals were obviously excited about the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but these good numbers could soon be more expensive for the citizens.
Because of the good financial situation, the congregation in the past was able to give up high taxes.
As a result, according to Gerster, frequent subsidies have already been cut off from the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory units.
Among other things, the cities and communities applying for grants must present certain hectares.
"We must look at the issue of raising funds, as investments are taking place in the coming years for which we would like grants," Gerster announced in this regard.
Nagold: Hugo Vermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the Men's Singer Cácilia is almost twice as long as the Herb Festival, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his Men's Song Association.
Even after 60 years, the song with the present will probably make him even more fun than the favorite chorus.
Wermter was also active in the Association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and association he received a number of awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Rapporteur on behalf of the Cácilien association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him a letter of honour, signed by Bishop Gebhard.
His colleagues handed him the copy of the German chorus association as well as a engraved tin counter.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival took place in ordinary railways: with the MGV Betra, the singer's cross-section Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music association, the Fullmaringer had a colourful mix of different hearings and singing styles, which held about 400 visitors.
The MGV full-maringer opened with vocal songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Be quiet, your brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared a small stand for honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The male singer Betra also sang classical choir songs like "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Very, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley".
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulsory" - the women's rate of the festival, the song kranz Salzstetten took care of.
The mixed chorus took off with the Neapolitan folk way "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Anton Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulsor" also came back to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back into the home field with "What's wrong with Schwab?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Paperts "Bierlied" where the Fullmaringer Musicverein offered the crowning musical ending.
For the children, there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannole Stolltemier introduced a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children had worked well on in the afternoon.
Children’s Dreams Become True
The children's gardens and children's playgrounds in the Zollernal district are given in these days Post.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the institutions in the realization of their construction and decoration desires.
Does the kindergarten need a new sand box?
Participation in the action may include all kindergartens, childcare facilities and children's cribs from the entire Zollernal district.
If you have a desire for construction or decoration for your installation, you can apply for this at the Black Forest.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Children's Garden building.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects from all the submissions three wishes.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of 2000 Euro and on a (action-) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide for many smooth construction helpers.
What about the action day and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergartens on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpful parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course, can be the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Empressed by Controversial Media Act
"We are in a frightening position, and we can ask ourselves, what does Parliament want us to do to put an end to the right independence tomorrow?" was to read in the paper which did not respect the draft legislation.
"The law is draconic and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most prominent independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be ahead because it is an extended arm of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government takes the new law "the media effectively into a guise". On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow" and described the draft as "draconic".
The adoption of the Act is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists at the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities because they published footage of security cameras, on which it was to be seen how the units sent to the factory allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to this by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative, even though the pre-loading was withdrawn after a media call.
Under the new law, media houses with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings can be imposed and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the other risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Court shall also have the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "the only penalty can force most radio broadcasters into the bankruptcy".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's description of 'living blogosphere'.
If they were to silence the media, politicians could do without punishment whatever they wanted.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who refers to the Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left behind, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, the Chinese legislators have already raised public concerns.
In May, they agreed to withdraw the reductions ordered by the National Compensation Commission and re-entered their fines of about 532,000 shillings free of tax per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A Dream Becomes True for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and rain, the official ceremony for the arts race was of no importance to the city and football club.
A more pleasant holiday was likely all of them wanted on the last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
So all those who came without a rainscreen or could not hold one for any reason.
It was the musicians who framed the feast, just like some speakers.
For this reason, Nass also became the FC President Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
He thanked all the mayor Walter Klumpp, who had made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, the municipality, the participating companies and members of the associations that joined.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty tenants placed 400 square meters of plaster stone for the new roads.
This remarkable honourary commitment was also appreciated by the Land-Agent Karl Rombach.
Other words were addressed to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South Badge Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that repeated weather-related influences in the spring and autumn were so attached to the original grass pitch that he could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first discussions to solve the problem when a third place was thought of at the site of the football club or at the real school at the Salinen Lake.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago thoughts came up about the establishment of an art race sports pitch, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were taken two years ago when the FC took over the schedule table in Erbacht, claimed a cost-sharing of EUR 100,000 for the construction of the site and validated the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipality decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros at the total cost of 560,000 euros, Klumpp joined in.
The construction of 68 times 108 meters of large artificial terraces took place on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were reduced, half of which was used for the installation of a Dirt-bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of internal affairs and justice.
The working group responsible met in Berlin on the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, parliamentary appointment and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its consultations.
This should include the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting views.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to decide to end - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda on Friday, the SPD undermined its no to a pkw-maut required by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "platrate for multimodal transport and thus ecologically counterproductive", the SPD negotiator explained the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of diversion on roads that are already crashing points.
The introduction of a wall for all pkw would also be only a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be abolished at a later time," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing wave on the freelance stage
Stuttgart - "When's it going to be right again summer?" was not actually the question on the Friday evening at the Freeway Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for the fighter star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the photo gallery to awaken the "singing wave".
Car driver seriously injured in accident
In the case of an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old Pkw professional from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on his way with her car on the Kempner Outserring in the direction of Grefrath.
When she wanted to turn left on St. Toniser's road, she missed the next car of the 37-year-old.
The roadmen collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Consistency: Distortion after accident on the switchboard
The incident was reported by the police when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday evening, at 8:00 p.m., drove on the left track of the two-track richenaustraße outtown.
Shortly before the circuit on the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-wing track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right track.
This led to a collision with the BMW running there, a 23-year-old constant.
The VW Passat was also damaged behind the BMW by a 19-year-old.
A total of about 15,000 saw damage, the police reported.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport clears passenger charges
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no more visas such as this in the future at the Vienna-Schwechat airport.
Most of the speech speakers thus fall away - the sound bubble is to be so clearly reduced.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport Speaker Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of visas for individuals.
Thus, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up the alarming calls.
By the way, on average, about 200 personal calls were made by the speakers on a day-to-day basis, it would be better to go to the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual crossings have been relatively few, but at the same time all other information about altered flights or departure times is a bit down here," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio transmitter.
Highlander-Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car trailer with tractors, there is a second match at the autumn agricultural festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games begin at 1.30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they are dressed in Swedish at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual combatants are measured in the disciplines of tree trunks, pits and water embankments.
Four-and-a-half meters is the tree trunk long and 25 to 30 kilograms hard.
"It doesn't go far," said organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be cast vertically, overcome once and then lie down.
This is assessed with most of the points.
In the case of caps, the target is accurate.
From eight meters away is thrown on a pflock.
Skill and strength shall be demonstrated by the participants in water intake above 50 metres.
Time and quantity of water in a bottle will be measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or "Clan" team, two may participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
It can be trained from 10 a.m.

But also swibic wear is allowed.
For "Outfit" the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can log in until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swedish Highlander Games and the Tractor Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been said on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, the fans will come at their own expense.
At 7:00 p.m., the Schömberg velvet blasphemous music is the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays beautiful Polkas and Marsche.
Its repertoire, however, also includes sensitive rollers and a soft big band sound.
With this, the Heinz Koch will be known as the singing host and blackberry baron from Weilen under the kidneys.
In Dornhan he has already appeared in the Christmas market and in the Narrenuzt.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten holds for breakfast, from 14 o'clock the Böffingen peasant chapel is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the party off.

The organizers are the Förderverein Mehrztinkhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Sindkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegane diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Purified tofu with plant sahne, for example, is a quartz set.
The Vegetarierbund is also referred to as the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November, Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, let yoghurt be replaced by soja yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hazelnuts, almonds or rice milk may be used.
Repositable plants tend to replace common pests.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half-turned mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a table-shaped linens plus three tables-beds of water are suitable for this.
Lockers are instead of eggs, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of back powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of sojayoghurt or seidentofu can meet this purpose.
According to the Webu, about 800,000 people are currently feeding in Germany, so pure plant.
Sleeping in New York
On the way to her host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American capital of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here is already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which in the evening is a special trip.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided on the day at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day, the freedom status could be achieved with a ferry and can be reached on foot.
Then it went through the financial center around the Wall Street to the memorial site of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view from the 373-metre view platform of the Empire state building.
Then it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets through the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students now arrive in their host families and experience the day of school at Weymouth High School.
This year, too, a Hubertus fair will be held on the day of the name of St. Mary's Church at Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was a rather thoughtless hunter who was transformed by a vision and was later appointed Bishop of Lüttich.
The hunting horn blaster group of hunters Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musses on Parforce horns (natural horns in the mood It) after old, original French melodies.
The blouses wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses and dogs on toads musically.
The festive fair takes place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed apparition shines with a new coffee.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu, it is said that Lexicon is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the same-named café at the strike in Kleve County in view of the Rhine-Wal University, it is not necessary to remain in the pure feeling of Déjà Vu.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make a real stay not only creative, but also hand-holding, constantly experienceable.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at Oplag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The high-modern but not cool coffee environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the hotel is the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually baked fresh baguattes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the beautiful café as gastronomists: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the strike, the sympathetic Café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least by the university.
"Where we do not have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all ages.
About Café-Liebhaber.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee-genus.
Enjoys the scenting hot bread in the various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of the expresso fan and Mirjam van der sets the cappuccino drinker.
"To do this, a baguette -- that's my thing," she betrays the NRZ.
There were two events already in the bright café.
I'd better say one thing.
Because the port festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a prominent fan of events evenings: "You can't do it all right now".
And with an event, I always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
Or, "Déjà Vu" is also for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the stake in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more to a gastronomy enamel.
To the delight of many climbers, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the gastromiles and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thanksgiving at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives were pleased to come.
In the club hall of the guesthouse "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious unity in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the foundation feast is always the appropriate festivety to perform honors.
About the special award "Singer of the Year" this time, writer Rolf Wagener was pleased.
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but you have also turned so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt gratitude," said the president of the Chores Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir samples were given this year to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by honorary president Horst Pier-Ribbert, the president himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants.
Place five took note of Arthur Brückner.
A special thanks the board directed to the team of Verinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets its regular corps every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. in the club hall.
"New singing voices are welcome at any time," Schlotmann says.
UN announces new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations will begin immediately with the development of a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty.
In front of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated at the summit that the time had come to "think about national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to engage in a process to be agreed with the universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will be built on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework.
I will not fail to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball team continues to have a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about it.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope we finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-party reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet carved out trees, Malmon has in advance warned the sign finger.
I've trained many players myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is to be expected whether there is further reinforcement from the first," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team needs to increase in any case compared to the past performances.
In front of all things in the coverage work and in the switching game, it was finally very powerful.
The use of opportunities must definitely be improved as well.
That's why I hope my players finally got their heads off during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique increase due to clashes between influential individuals
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to agree to a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
In fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the title "We Ask for Security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the city's independence spot.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst fights since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by the White Rhodesia and later by the South Africa apartheid government in an effort to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a growing conflict, but the latest events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy, much is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas deposits from the coast and coal warehouses in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo each other are responsible for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala on 17 October, a traditional Hochburg Renamos.
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated, as government troops attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, Renamos told speakers against the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama was considered a "loser" who "is willing to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force the government to make his decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo issued the 1992 Peace Agreement.
Against the FT, he explained that he felt that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have only contributed little to meeting the tensions experienced by a number of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who will come together," says Joseph Hanlon, professor at the Open University and Mozambique experts.
None of them is good in the bargain, and none is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who insists on election reforms, has already stated that she will boycott municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to disrupt the movement to produce concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos election success has collapsed since 1992, while a new party, founded by a previous Renamo member, Movimento Democratique de Mozambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – his resignation, when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacities Renamo has, but it has taken an unrestful attack on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fights took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale used to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the road.
Mazanga answered the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "the international community to warn that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Unstableness has increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already taken care of corruption, progress in development and a recent recovery wave.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protestor, said people just wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful roads again,” he explained.
Children should get myths and legends added as "preamples for life", says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks", and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "too wild, too aggressive and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught to schools", therefore Crossley-Holland complained about a "careful selection" of old-fashioned works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for the past twenty years.
He added that, among authors and teachers who were “over-educated”, children would be “completely disabled” because in entertaining stories the messages would be “undeservable”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the fishing season and was author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible.”
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be illustrated subversively, revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of the show instead of telling.
Hansjakob pulls again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob visited his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
Many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short-term game.
From the arrival of the award of the honorary citizenship to his death, the film author and Hansjabb producer Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece, which was a great coincidence under the control of Cornelius Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as speakers with the ten different scenes, explained relationships and overstepped time spans from the youth to the upcoming retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob came home to his children's sky, in his home.
And then the scene began, where Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade than the great son of the city.
Stilicht introduced Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the twins and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" with the "Schwarzwälder Füchsen".
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, but also his sister, Philippines, welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to move into the role of the sister and gave her in Mimik and Gestik an incredible life.
The Mühlenbacher Farmer's band played selected pieces of music properly between the different scenes and thus rounded out the performance.
In order to grant the honorary authority, Haslach's Mayor Heinz Winkler was honored, who, in the presence of the then official Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his expectation.
Their expectations then led the Dreichönig-singer, who led Hansjakob to the call: "How beautiful, then, will young people live at my own Dreichönig time again."
With their song "O Jesulein", they enjoyed the audience in the outdoors as well as the day children with their famous "Heraus, Out".
His criticism at the office church had then expressed his concern about the growth of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeyard, behind his tomb on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," said it at the end of the scene.
There was a lot of applause and many praising words from the audience for the performance.
basketball: The hope of Neckar Giants grows
The chances for the remaining leagues of the sport-defeated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because there should be a Wildcard procedure, then there is now a lower competitor for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project abandons an application for a possible back seat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been designing the concept of a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
A first blow was still not to be taken from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure, so long as it was not established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until May 23rd, climber Düsseldorf basketball will be able to submit documents to the arbitration panel and demonstrate its economic viability.
So far, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The divorce court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The church of the evening is turning into the point of view
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office devoted the last of its public topics on Sunday, October 27, the evening meal church.
After the visit of the Atomic Keller Museum, the Haigerlocher was to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning point is a visit to the evening meal church.
There the leaders get the history of the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.
Not least in the church is the view of the evening meal created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original authentic reproduction of the famous Milanian model by Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. on the Atomic Keller Museum.
There are maps on the box of the Atomic Keller Museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. trade.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney-General could either ask written questions or meet in Russia at the age of 30.
This was reported by the Agency’s Interfax under a call to non-closely named circles that were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified in the interstate, it was said.
A snow trip from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany allies of the United States, threatened snowden there the delivery, it continued
Longer Spirit Makes Pay
Six men's teams fought in the tennis tournament of the Associations for the title of the winner.
In the end, the duration of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sport friend Rohrdorf to the tournament of local associations and friends.
The fun of tennis was in front of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plane, each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament was in the best hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were the same as Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the victory, Carmen Müller was finally able to transfer the hiking pool to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was twice Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze stairs reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team asphaltricher.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cakes, the successful sound of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauerhof in Gutach is still in children's hand.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children's and family party with numerous participations and events.

In a New Zealand city, Burt Muro is considered to be a loving caucus because he took part in a race in America with his motorcycle, the 1920s.
Burt is not to be taken away from his dream despite a heart error.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he moves over to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there are coffee, tea and cakes.
Schrille's Peepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships on the shelf.
The company has at its site several irons in the fire.
In addition to carbon imports, Rhenus Midgard places on windlass logistics, among other things.
Black smears the coal on the storage site in front of you.
Two powerful blue semi-trailers distribute or download the coal here as required.
With each movement of the surrounding gears, a shrill warning sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are legally prescribed," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavourable wind, there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He took the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the people concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals with technical measures.
In the future, he will also sit on the open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has some more in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to place coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meters extension of the terminal, capesize-bulkcarrier can also be manufactured here for a long time.
"This year we want to knock the 3 million-tonnes mark on the wrap," said Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant, the import coal goes to power plants in the country.
If the GDF-Suez power plant still goes to the network, good 5 million tonnes of carbon imports per year are realistic.
The three shipowners on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague was not able to extinguish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe this, even against the best team of Europe in the past two years," Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic balanced after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the titled defender of Olympiakos Pireus.
We sent the message: There is also basketball in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichs sold themselves very well for a long time, but in the decisive stages were simply not clear enough.
The guests first managed to turn the art piece into a 15-point stand 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We have fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made slight mistakes," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful broadcasters of the Munich, who had won a significant victory in the first two parties against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zigliona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, Variety Artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway to tell the lot of jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years Fays innovation has been expanded, as recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
In life, led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standing-up institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these leaders started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known to appear in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are events by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby take place.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A series of comedians participating this year at the festival have become more unconventional, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was introduced to a cable TV sitcom (the Ironic-Fantasy-Football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the crew at "Saturday Night Live" as well as at "Parks and Recreation", although she is the best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, race-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a prominent television and film director as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he goes through the gas between two buildings and thinks: hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran is satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows its satisfaction with the five UN veto guards and Germany a week before the next nuclear meeting.
"After years you now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to clarify the differences of the past years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear dealer was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end of both sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Killed Game Cameras with Machete
Two children in Uruguay were killed by an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go hunting with them.
With Mackenzie and Messers armed, they surprised the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
After that, they would have played football in a working neighborhood in front of their apartments.
The Leichnam was discovered in the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half - sister of the disciple who had taken them should say that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl in front of the police described the tather march without mention of an attack against them, the two boys committed the intended murder of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the parents called it a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric ward.
Prisoner must be in prison
Due to exploitation of human trafficking, occupation, threat, injury and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former German defence soldier, who worked after two positions in Afghanistan as a doorkeeper, issued a statement in a procedural agreement.
Thus, in five cases he met women about Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the strike after a few weeks against her will.
He maintained resistance to break with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who bought for some years for him.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards, he had contact with women in the outside world.
Together with a colleague from the women, he brought them to different brothels in the south-west.
There he partially monitored her to control her revenue.
The accused first claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had come to him in the face of an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus limited guilt, the 33-year-old left a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to understand the injured women.
As a Kripo official reported, at least four other cases of exploitation of human trafficking could be identified after a first announcement by telephone surveillance.
The hearings were marked by high aggression.
In later acquisitions, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, where one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, has not made a statement to date.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this metay is seen as normal.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He got rid of these circles and wanted to lead a very normal life," he said.
Oil prices continue to reach 96 USD per barrel
The oil price was also dropped on Friday, after worrying about a high offer overrun a report, which increases the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in China.
The reference oil types for deliveries in December were dropped by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in electronic commerce in Europe at the New York Mercantile Exchange at the latest in the morning.
The contract fell by 39 cent on Thursday, which meant a drop in price of 5.8% in October.
The large supply of crude oil has charged prices in the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the offer was increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, there was evidence of a stronger demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of the Chinese economy, whose growth rose to 7.8% in the third quarter after it reached its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the species Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by US refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London at 26 cents at 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court Blocked Decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Directive
On Thursday, a Federal Appeal Court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had demanded changes to the Stop-and-Frisk Program (“Keep and Search”) of the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a call was decided on the city.
The judge had decided in August that the city would break down the Constitution in the manner in which the program for the detention and questioning of persons would be implemented.
The city called against its assessment and the planned relief measures, including the decision to set up a supervisory body to assist the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension required.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be removed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US Judges by stating that a judge should avoid the view of the party; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were unduly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-free program in sight.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras carried out by the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was prepared to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
A oral negotiation for the city's occupation is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactics were criticised by a number of civil rights offenders.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls increased during the time of partial mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, belonging to all minorities, filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk Program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police and influence the way other police presidents use the regime.
They are opposed to the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; money would also be wasted and the wider problem of a police force, which has been under pressure since thousands of people's departure in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the Stop-and-Frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reforming the implementation of the controls by NYPD.
From the luck of the dreaming camels
Good luck is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels
With this concern, the first president, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have remarkable success.
The first president, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the Association.
He himself was the first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheyk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and Gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on several trips.
During the talks, images were shown from the stakes on a large canvas so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the said actions.
The Association’s desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed that this vehicle be equipped with a photovoltaic device and is now planning to become active at the association in advisory function, according to Henne.
In 2008, the Schleeh room from Baiersbronn in the record time of almost one week created the hospital in Socogim, a disaster district on the outskirts of the capital.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times where the birth clinic is to be denationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, so shen, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to take as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to hospital here in various areas.
In addition, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medications, association materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a lot of local color, telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles built on the mobile track and the experiences of the family musicians, who traditionally supported the association, on their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing the accounts as young MPs.
When it became clear to him how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget through the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also requires global love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
Gran Canaria wasn't far from Africa.
Coulson set up phone hacking to check a tip
The previous news of the Word Editor Andy Coulson reportedly introduced "telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" when trying to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Public Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the Court in Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court heard.
“In the opinion of the public prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is no one who stands before people’s apartment and hopes to meet them in a fresh way, but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows from second, surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What's it look like with the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He argues about it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
News about an affair Clarkes was first taken up by the feature editor of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Do not waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A band with voicemails from her phone for at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time when the researchers lived, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail containing the following: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The swearers heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was engaged to the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have sworn to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have added the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned tax, the French football will actually be the first strike since 1972.
A blow-up meeting is going to end in vain.
In the conflict around the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered themselves into a pocket gas after a failed match.
President François Hollande received their complaints on Thursday in Paris, Élysée-Palast.
He refused, however, to release the football from the planned 75-percent fee of more than one million euros per year to pay all companies in the country for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hearty.
The strike announced at the end of November will also be taken through, the chief association of the Proficklubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, told.
The game days set between 29 November and 2 December in the League 1 and the League 2 are therefore due.
Things: No absolute protection possible
"We want to include the residents early in planning," Mayor Jens Häßler opened the Citizens Information Event on the High Water Protection Concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the community hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and bring ideas.
Hüßler made it clear: "The final decisions fall on the members of the municipality".
The high water, which went unprepared on 15 May 2009, was an intrusive event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, Häüßler said.
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighboring community Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many farmed land as possible is the goal," Häüßler said.
On the basis of this, the planning of protection against a German weather service is statistically expected to be high water every 100 years.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15-percent increase.
This is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that led to significant damage in 2009 in Gechingen corresponded to a 1000-year-old high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Hüßler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros must be invested in gears, with the municipality with land grants of about 70 per cent.
However, Hüßler pointed out that there is only support if a general concept is implemented.
For this purpose, the Community is directed towards the involvement of the citizens.
An extensive planning and approval procedure has to be completed.
In the best case, 2016 can start with implementation.
Among other things, the concept of protection, which was presented in the municipality last week (we reported) of local measures in response to the Irm River from the family valley.
Following the presentation of the High Water Protection Concept, the participants took advantage of the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was asked why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, the expert planner of the Hügelsheim Engineering Office, who presented the concept, stressed that the interaction of all the measures presented is necessary in order to achieve the desired goal.
In addition, it is kept to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Discouraged were the people of the old village who, even in normal weather rains, had to suffer again and again under an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Hüßler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems should be different from those for water protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to extend the channel network so that two to three-year-old rain events can be triggered.
To scale the drain channels larger, millions would go down.
Serious injuries after collapse
On the early Friday afternoon, on the road 44 near Revensdorf, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could not say anything about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first.
The fact is that the 19-year-old driver of a VW golf course drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf opposed her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles would collapse, and the woman was so heavily trapped that the firearm needed only half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both unfortunates arrived in nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
You could call him Dostojewski, U.S.A.
Philip K. Dick was a searcher, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serious.
Fascinating the relationship outside: the piercing eyes, the bart, the high stars.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski with his massive Oeuvre is to be understood as the founder and apologetic of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is in his own country.
Some titles were published in the Heyne publisher, the Haffmans case with the 118 stories is distributed in the second millenniums.
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technical progress, paired with Paranoia, security waves and the faith, to be selected.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, they put drugs in his brain.
He found out early that the computers are goddesses.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what a person differs from a machine, the Creator from his Creator.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Kill it.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired filmmakers like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minorities Report" comes from 1956, and it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of pre-crime is developed, pre-crime, which is what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is as scary as ours, look at mutants into the future - and the police approach.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We take them before they commit a crime of violence."
And: "In our society, there are no serious criminals, for which we have a criminal criminal-full of people." You read the stream of time.
They assume that bad things happen, and they prevent the criminal idea from actually being implemented.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the hearing of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's Drone Philosophy and Practice also works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police officer complains that there is no more violence, the military controls everyday - and what's left of the state.
Then the watchman himself will be guarded, and a future crime will be committed.
The system's turning.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It finds its own requirements.
Not only does he buy wrong people and victims, but he builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick says to get closer to the truth all the time.
Tell me about Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum case in the U.S. case about Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Court of Justice could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-olds in Russia personally, Interfax reported.
Previously, the Green-Bundagsagsagsagret Hans-Christian Ströbele had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
Enhancing NSA findings for State surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police officer ran deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the request of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. external office, which is less than 5 km away from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States did not use the possibility of foreign espionage "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could enhance their international competitiveness or profit."
However, since Edward Snowden, who became a single employee of Whistleblower, has begun publishing his full horn to US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the Director by word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency espioned the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The passage to the crossing led to the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkels had been on the phone, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe is able to get to the visa, business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. Home Affairs and Business transparent.
I believe that this data is likely to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States is now at almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, there has been no evidence in Snowden's documents that the US has disclosed the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
The Federal Day was proposed, we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
“It doesn’t work that way,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal over cars to agriculture.
Everything up to the IT sector.
However, large-scale and technical refinements of the US spy authorities discovered by the snowflakes have shocked companies that had seen the largest spy risk in China.
There is a major change in cloud computing because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to legal proceedings and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade agency, the US-American data mining activities revealed that about ten percent of the non-U.S. members had planned to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, the vice-president of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers that hasn’t existed a year ago – it says: Where will my data be stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this area?”
Many German business leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be watched at any price.
Economic espionage is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial levels, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management usually does not care about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this benefits attackers.
In large companies employees have long been inspired to say that taking a free USB stick at a fair or the unwatched location of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member of the Audi auto-manufacturer, says that it has been the standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid hands when going abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid hands are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in the respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access," the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, two of the countries were listed in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel behind China, which served to obtain the economic data of the hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it came to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Home Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The Secret Services know very well that all countries, even if working together in the fight against terrorism, spy their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe answers wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery journey that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration has succeeded, now gave a special show in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: The retro-look has been reintroduced.
This starts at the wedding dressers.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In front are the clothes often torn and covered with stickers, often with a wearer, on the back they go down their back and often end up in a trap.
However, the spirits differ, as Stefanie Koch highlights from the fashionable dresser.
In men the suit is dominated by West and Plastron, but it can also be chosen cream coloured or brown combinations.
Significantly, the selection of the location has been explained.
Non-precious side rooms are not optimal, the environment should be special.
Here the domain paid attention to her own offer in the remise.
Whoever wants to go ahead with the Kutsche, for which Uwe Link has an offer.
"Cuts are also popular for juveniles," he says.
Romantics is also asked for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion come the "After-Wedding-Photo" - that is, series of recordings in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding dress, Elizabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, the guest can entertain in style.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friendly Success
Repeatedly, the athletes of the dog friend bitz were successful on a Rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the class of beginners and secured the fifth place, and with the 15 months old Marley brought it with 87 points in place twelve.
Susi Höpp and her woody in Class 1 presented the critical views of the executive director.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a grouped ring mat in the tournament of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright matte, which stood behind the tribune in the school hall.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowdes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but that the family of the 17-year-old was disappointed.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, compared to FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that every logic is out of harmony with the laws of physics as well as with the healthy human mind," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be obscured in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back in the body bag," he comments.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday, there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
That's what Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "position-conditioned stabilization".
A second autopsy, however, caused another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will be assigned to the FBI by conducting the investigations.
A representative of the county sheriff's authority was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia arranged on Wednesday that the authorities should release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings would indicate how he died.
CDC publishes school allergy guidelines
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines on the treatment of food allergies in children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government since the number of children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States currently has a food allergy.
The distribution of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent, according to CDC between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and employees and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine pre-existing – the self-injection of the EpiPen brand is most often used – in order to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the Federal States have recently amended the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrine more easily available.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue is chewing".
Parents of intersexual children can choose "unspecified sex"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognized for children who were born with unexplained genitalia.
Newborns are no longer granted to men or women.
According to the new law, parents must no longer declare sex to such children, but may indicate "unspecified" or "not specified" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to put pressure on parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on sex-related operations in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
An intersexual person said, according to BBC years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm still the girlwork created by doctors, confused and full of jokes.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children comes to the world every year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes, caimdrites (iron or heads) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not well developed, but most experts in the United States advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used, if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before, if at all, deciding for an operation.
The New York Psychiater Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "kling for a good thing".
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Many people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but for most children this is not true," he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data about how a child develops his or her sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret, so people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not related to sex, but is conditioned by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both simultaneously or not defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in the following sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, behaviour, breast and status, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by intersexual and transgender persons in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Not with the gender picture boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australia’s Norrie May-Wellby (52) was recognized as the world’s first “unsexual” person after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of a “unspecified” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German demonstrations have a third allocation, X for intersexual, so the Ministry of the Interior.
In the neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a message to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "sex theory" should be removed from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, stating: “If the world is broken into a new state where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we reverse two further pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"The parent is also under stress without any further restrictions, especially if you do not know the gender of your own child," she said to the parent's website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were named as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God who had both genders.
Ten years ago, the doctor considered the sex to be something that can be deleted and then rebuilt.
In the meantime, however, the ethical foundations of an operation are disappointed after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when he grows up with the sex they have given him.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a “psychiatric emergency”, says Drescher.
When such a child was born, you don't call the psychiatrist, you call the surgeon.
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with indistinct genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money from John's Hopkins University, which presents the view that sex can be formed.
He marked the term “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmental attacks – how parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/John" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He drives a boy's parents, whose penis was separated by a twisted cutting, to cast the child completely and also to remove his head and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a change, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
But at 38 he started suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have been brought to the public who are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but two-way genitalia.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and his head were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD by which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After having learned the truth, he changed to male identity, received testosterone injections and allowed his breasts to be removed.
The operation made him fruitless.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are seen as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice in California, ensures that the German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘not determined’ to the child,” she explained.
We are afraid that this will benefit from the intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex".
"Adolescents should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law deals with the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to which young children should be forced at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast doctor, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "powerful" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor deficiency of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but no Uterus and no egg stick.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although it is fruitless, however, it hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make decisions overcrowded," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do various tests and clarify things and gives them such time before they write "man" or "female".
In this way everything is all right – you take the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don't have to do an operation that can't go back.
"This puts the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the gender that best suits him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Unknown girl injured by shots from car
An unknown person injured a 12-year-old in a car in Sachsen-Anhalt.
On Thursday evening in Genoa, the perpetrators were likely to fire a group of children with an air pressure gun.
That's what the police told me in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left van.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The gun came from a small car that was passing by on a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc has been created.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police found out it was on Friday.
So far, the police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to eggsing children, who threw them against domestic fashions.
Since the houseowners recognized this in time and removed the egg residues equally, there should also be no damage to the property.
In addition, some Sylvester bulbs were also burned in the city area, but also here no damage has occurred.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his Pkw was built with a piece of paper and his wheeled blindfolds were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man discovered his radar blinds in close proximity all the time, so the police did not have to continue working.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamtfully.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with many greens, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
"Do you hope they're not afraid of spins?" asks Waltraud Ries and shows up on a fat spin on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spinnenphobia, but the concern that at age the many steps to the house and in the apartment can no longer be managed, she explains.
In addition: Since a meniccus operation, the mid-fifty woman in her own body has had to learn what it means to move with a handicap from floorwork to floorwork.
Recently, a book from her appeared on the subject 'Happy to live in age - What form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at all at the age', she begins to tell.
When she and her husband moved to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, in the mid-50s, Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all involved with the topic 'Living in the Age'.
Most people force it as long as it goes.
It's always gonna be the other ones' age, she says it's embarrassing.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great is one to think.
'But then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-defined living age.
'What form of living you choose is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always assume that they can also become ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, you also join in the Dolce Vita,' gives the specialist book writer the pleasure to consider.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioner WG.
At the age, everyone has his tickets and cards
'For me, it would be such a community, but nothing,' she says with an eyebrows.
Not as much as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At an age you just need his retreats', as Ries said.
However, the author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior resident community can work.
But that had to happen differently than in the classic WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, she thinks.
In this opinion, at least she is not alone in the capital of the country.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for so long,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital.
Its service advises people around the topic 'Be older'.
Therefore, even older people would often also purchase inconveniences and restrictions just to be able to stay in their usual surroundings, which is also the experience of the Foundation Warentest.
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who deal with the old-fashioned reconstruction of their home or home should first be thoroughly informed and not tasked with the best craftsman.
Today there are also for the old-fashioned conversion specialists.
Even in the rental apartment, one or more of them can be realized, and if it's just the increase in the toilet, the interior architecture clears up.
But it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment properly and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
While you could install a stairs lift within the apartment, which would also be a much larger obstacle to the apartment door.
She will continue until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it is more than before the spin on her apartment door.
USA wants Snowden to continue to prosecute
The United States has not changed its attitude towards former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
It will continue to be proposed that secret information should not be disclosed.
Therefore, he had to put himself in a criminal procedure in the United States, the spokesman of the U.S. Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, said in Washington.
Neither would the latest expressions of snowden change that.
Previously, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströblee had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that in the case of strike statements, it is the case of a parliamentarian and not of a German member of the government.
Secret Service Tüller Edward Snowden is generally ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This was made clear by the former NSA staff sought by the United States in a non-addressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströblee on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Federal Day and the Federal Attorney General.
After a translation of strawberries, the text reads as follows:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your survey for mass monitoring.
My name was Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously engaged in a contract or a direct appointment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I have witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government, which have forced me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself subjected to a severe and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am now living in exile and enjoying the temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have assessed the findings to be a system of comprehensive surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage disclosures made many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming more and more clear; at the same time, the risks purchased have been reduced visually.
Although the outcome of my efforts proved to be positive, my Government still treats this as a breach of trust and seeks to criminalise and accuse political opinion.
Nevertheless, to speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will adopt this derogatory attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are met, I will be able to participate in the full accountability of the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in good faith and in accordance with the law.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to preserve international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Children's Gardens Found a Private Buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Maier of Winterlingen.
The former kindergarten in the garden street sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipality agreed to the sale at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "announced" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the previous kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, how to heat up, look at the garden and clear the path.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Place concert at high temperature
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach offers a place concert on the terrace of Hammer's guesthouse.
When conductor Bianca Willmann has the voltage at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners are happy to hear the sounds of Hammri's musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped successfully manage the first musical hockey.
Report: Obama's campaign to replace bids by Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors have secretly suggested replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the book that will soon be published, and on Thursday night, she reported that the president's top advisors had conducted "large group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's hope of re-election would be better if he left bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent of the Times, the book fundamentally shows the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values that former Foreign Minister Clinton has had on the Vice-Presidents.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House leaders David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
In 'Double Down' it is claimed that Daley has stood at the top of his efforts to exchange prayer despite his 'strong personal relationship', before he finally decided against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would not "improve the chances of Obama".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually decided to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I expressed a whole series of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
We must remember that the President had terrible surveys at the time, so we thought, "God's will, what are we doing?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "supply care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train would pay for the election hours.
"There is not much money to be spent in campaigns for surveys and focus groups if you don't think about something seriously," Martin told AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change of decision.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious", the former chief of staff said that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political polls had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama didn't know anything about the investigations about whether to let bites fall at the elections.
"Possible," said Martin.
What's going on with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an e-mail.
Was the e-mail similar to that of the original post technically implemented in the design of the Internet service?
The concept of early Internet services was a prerequisite for making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take into account the need to create a stable basis for a more secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a common e-mail corresponds rather to an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two then connected directly?
Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the track, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his supplier.
Will regular e-mails be read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read on the way several times by software robots.
In the case of the consignor, it is usually checked if the mail conducts a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a malicious and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots still have another job?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also detects the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benny communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can include corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails with?
The probability that unauthorized people read a mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
The prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to capture e-mails or to get to know.
This is the result of possible illegal expression actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With an encryption based on the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively against readers.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to identify who has communicated with.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a survey by Convios Consulting of August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the most private sector.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had recently fallen, GMail was able to make a significant contribution from Google.
Mother in the forest stowed and paid rent
When his beloved mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cast their rent and maintenance money.
In order to continue paying rent and maintenance money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest.
First, he changed the death of 89-year-olds, then he narrowed the money for more than half a year.
Now the 67-year-old has to be responsible for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
Then the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, the mother in need of care no longer needed medication.
The investigator told the tenant that his mother was traveling to Spain.
Because the officials were curious about this, they went on to figure it out.
It came to the conclusion that the two had lived in a common home for more than 15 years and that he had cared for them lately.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, there was no point of reference for a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first lighting ice in the dark – using quails.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the marine bodies and created a glowing sweetness.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on whales and could convince Chinese scientists to produce the shiny protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thereby raising the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the food is reacting to the heat in the mouth and lit up – the more you smell, the easier it will be.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and this gives you two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
If the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the whale light material is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that, it tastes good.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation will be even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and for itself impossible because of the light fracture caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream is made; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a whale that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association league after six days.
It is now calculated for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehlers behaves optimisticly.
He finally has, with the exception of the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme, his complete frame available.
Daverden also puts us on a tempo game.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, there is an increase in the coverage, which has recently left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against the North Horn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to lag in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this purpose, the A-young Joost Windsust, which is active in the A-young federalist HC Bremen, celebrates its seasonal debut.
Whoever's not hot in such a game is supposed to stay home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffler.
In the last two years, I haven't declared myself willing to distribute my apartment from sweets, and I guess it won't do it this year either.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep, as regards Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations, as the US-American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm happy about every Halloween then again is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion US dollars spent on 6.9 billion, so the NRF.
This year are exciting unbelievable items of the last step.
Women no longer need to wear sexy clothes, they can now also engage in seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect every amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I rule that the Daphth Punk World Dreams will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs, so we weren't alone with my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for the costumes of their pets, so the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As for sweets, we're not shy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, lutes, beans and gum beans.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce, 41 million people, with the word "sweet or saures" coming through the neighborhood.
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we're not going to eat anything.
The only thing we don't want to consume is Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, so the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion maize grains.
It's a puzzle I haven't been able to solve yet.
There's nothing more to Halloween than houses where it smells.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is also in a real prison), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spout houses in the United States that earn $500 million, says America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you just tap into your pants and then put the friends on Facebook where you don't release them again, and then one of the type on which you're standing leaves a comment like "near facial expression".
But let's finally get to the dolls.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Cubby when we were children, and the cutting of a cubby is like the decoration of Christmas tree – something that we have done from small to small.
Luckily, last year's "baby in Kürbis" trend started thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up to cut the Kürbis and not to sit there.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on basketball, so the US Census Bureau.
The beads, which slowly rot in the front yard, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of beet were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut some pretty from their 921 kilos of heavy cubes.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains sold bodies
The firefight had to express itself in Helmrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof starts at night for Friday fire.
The rescue forces mount a cold body out of the house.
Rescue forces found in a fire in Hellbrechts a cold body in a three-family house.
Whether it's a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening, it was burned at the ground floor of the house.
When the firearm came in, the flames were already blowing out of a window.
The operatives went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This room and another room were completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
First, the building is no longer habitable.
The exact reason for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest land church has launched an offensive in order to recruit for the profession of the pastor.
The Evangelical-Lutheric Church of Hannover estimates that the number of some 1,800 pastors and pastors will be half in the present situation by 2030.
For young people of today, the profession was very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day course itself.
With Burfien, the Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people for theology study.
At present, fewer young people choose to study theology after the abitor.
Burfien this leads back to the process of decircumcision: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession was marked by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my appointment calendar and can put my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to humans as a soulguard.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well of it.
I am sure that more will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have been a safe employer.
This is against young people today, not just about careers, but about a busy job.
According to the Church of the Land, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently in rest per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicaria.
In thinly populated areas such as Harz, Emsland or Wanderland, it may be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien, among other things, wants to hold a study for young people and also invite prominent people who have studied theology.
Theology study provides extensive training.
You can even become the President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a free presentation.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the support of Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced runners, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare new people for Rally Raid’s traps and realities.
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenges – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a day of training and testing for the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to take part in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firearm for the rescue of a hen, which was placed 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rock run in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby was hit by a small traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the stone breach in her false position
Firefighters turned on rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The firearm was able to secure a handle that was fixed in a rock wall on a 15-metre high slope.
The nine months old cockerspian dog Ruby was killed after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone three days before she was rescued from a stone breach on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to Rockbreak Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and published social networks when they had run out of stone after the small traffic accident.
At 2:15 p.m. on the Wednesday, a walker saw his dog, the beached Ruby on the 15-metre high section of the stone.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station sailed to the scene and took off for the rescue of Rubys, which was then transported in a dogbox up there.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge fortune."
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian for examination but did not detect anything except exhalation and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "To see the salvation was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in her arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the invention had become too big and it would have been broken, it would probably have been destroyed.
The firefighters have done great.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger said he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer at Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the Altrocker at night, and that “he had turned me on when I was 18”.
She added: "It's been a long time, and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he has ever made an attempt to get closer to Katy Perry".
The representative added: “Perhaps she has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.

George Kerevan: European Distortion Gives the Shot the Choice
A new day, a new story of fear of independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the clue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with stacked wire along the Hadrian Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic advantages that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe, but this, hopefully, did not play a role in the strikes.
No one has mentioned that EU Member States often apply their strict rules if it is more favourable to them.
As Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would be only a small concession to the contrary to what you really want from the Scottish people.
So it's not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: for the first time, I have heard the "independence means passport checks" sentence at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European fever?
Why does the London Joch trade against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, which has been made in the wake of the war, has come to the fore.
The euro crisis officially killed the project Europe.
Everywhere in the EU, EU-friendly parties win or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party was able to remember for itself almost five million votes for Germany – just this year’s foundation – and thus effectively distribute free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag in September.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, is a turning point.
Due to the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced-jacket in which the national economy is required by the maintenance of the single currency, many people feel that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devalued the local currency, South Europe will again find itself with a built-in productivity gap vis-à-vis Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending – driven by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current state and currency problems.
As a result of the "green" energy directives, which were prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a loathsome cost advantage, as we have already seen in Granmemouth.
All payrolls in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being forced into the corner from cheap American skiing gas.
As a result, a revolt is taking place, especially in France, the EU's sole leader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to eye height with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has expressed its own economic policy, which has to fight the affected French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens, the EU-enemie Front National, has just won a decisive re-election, thus referring the ruling socialists to three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot get out of it, a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU waves next year to prevent an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut down well in these elections – and this is very good – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I want to go: in the near future, the growing consensus against the EU and the single currency will be brought together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the "Europe of the (superbeneficial) nations", which favoured General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of becoming involved in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific is drawing attention to the fact that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all that?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels, what they can do.
I think Scotland could be doing a lot better in a more leisurely European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping Norway equal and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and in 2011 has won a spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and undertaken) reductions that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition had to take.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence only to be forced into a savings policy by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: grow faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not yet directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already growing up at the age of seven or eight years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents – normally it's not a sign that puberty is entering quickly," Kalowitz explained.
The apparent signs of development, such as growing breasts, sham and axelhae, as well as body noise, are shown earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift at the age of Menarche (the appearance of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Fruhe Pubertät in Girls: the essential adviser to dealing with this frequent problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is 'early' when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth gap before an eight year old.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnant – something that a child doctor can monitor.
When making rapid progress, tests could be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are methods of treatment to delay early menstrual periods and to avoid another consequence: the early age of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a medication or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is withholding what drugs are concerned with, but he says: “Repression of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They take care of the risk of pregnancy or how they maintain the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter received ten days.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school to home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be genuine.
Boys come to puberty like girls before.
Kaplowitz is the view that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study on girls aged six to nine in 2001 that creates a relationship between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be influenced by early puberty by all possible things, from economic conditions over the climate to genes.
Another challenge: While boys are already growing face and shame, the trend towards a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stress the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of acne and shamhaar is spread even among babies and children.
"We must be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their child’s doctor as they should speak to her child.
“This may mean that you have to conduct a conversation earlier than expected”, Riet Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it entered earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute in the face of large orders over seat width
Among leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class in long-distance flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who try most of the airlines, but this demonstrated space represents the key to efficiency claims in the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week demanded a industry standard that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are betting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft, and are expected to hold record orders from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular, whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the stated economic results to deliver the new mini-jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" takes 406 people in the tourist class who are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transporter 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Air giants often share hives about technical details through advertising in the press.
Airbus now appeals to the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to run directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed donors a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept it?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
In the face of changing eating habits, people are fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and by the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years, so the data of the US Ministry of Health.
The size of the male average American in the 21st century, according to U.S. health statistics, is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival held a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
So Airbus was investigated that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increased the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing argues with Airbus figures at headquarters and says that it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines to balance air fares with the institution.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It is really up to airlines to provide flexibility so that they can do what they have to do in order to be successful,” explains Flight Cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know her business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is a greater freedom of choice, but for manufacturers, there will increasingly be a topic that can affect sales.
Behind the controversy is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the sitzlayout is the driving force behind the confrontation around the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitting Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings statements depend in part on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than the machines currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore asks for more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Kenston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at the existing 777s, pointed out that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could result from cheaper air fares.
"The 18-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin installation, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-wide Jet sellers even wear band sizes to measure the installation in competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for cheap flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with tens of rows, but has not yet sold, according to its own statement.
Until recently Airbus has stressed how important the adaptability of the cabins is and for some jets has offered wide seats on the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call to a new industry standard is likely to be grounded, but could deviate from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make it pleasant to smoke
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a long time from nicotine poisoning.
In front of tests on people, further tests are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Great Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine search is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice with nicotine were given their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination had taken a "time off", the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they included antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical to maintain the antibodies.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, as it converts liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people could, if he is sure, be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine.
But it is more likely that smokers would use him to stop.
“They know then: If they start smoking again, they no longer feel satisfied because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to relax the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi argues that Obeid has been influenced
Against the former Minister of Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by State corruption supervision.
The former NSW minister argues that the regulations on maritime pollution have been amended at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who held hidden participations in three plots of land in a state-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) on Friday extended its investigation into whether Obeid had influenced various State Ministers to extend contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without a call after their departure in August 2005.
Now, due to the charge, Tripodi has been found to have been aware of Obed's hidden interest in the land after Tripodis had previously represented Chief Officer Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had insisted on public tenders for the agreements.
The climbers were opposed and also wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, contracts were extended for the companies at the Circular Quay, which offered the obids $2.5 million annually, without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken for public tenders.
But he disagrees that the changes have been made to requests by Obed, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced the reform of the government's rules of procedure.
One of the IAC's telephone signatures showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who was transferred to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Where is the topic discussed in this telephone conversation about the development of commercial sanctions?" asked the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes reach destination in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirming a leading government employee against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, it was the goal of Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already made air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to a 'reality test'
In the context of the extended measures, the Government considers a 'reality test' for foreign workers with 457 visas.
If the test is introduced, it will use a criterion to prevent 457 from being used to recruit unqualified jobs or as a back door for accessing family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former MPs of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be taken up by the neighbours of Australia as an insult.
"Sound statements such as "foreigns are to be set aside" and "first set up Australia" are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to ruin an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures that were once referred to by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was talking yesterday about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes that will be considered by others.
If the "reliance criterion" is taken over, then someone who applies for a visa could be examined as to whether "the application is true in cases where the applicant is connected or personally connected with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company."
Companies could also be obliged to take account of the number of 457 vis-à-vis holders after having finally set up hundreds of companies in the past, who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan Asylant died on a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat.
The nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him will be cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to make high-speed connections between Scotland and Northern England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2 is completed, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from 32.6 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further road capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of at least three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits with it.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on him to use "unintelligible" for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection provides the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also provides Scotland's economic power with an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for high-speed rail connections in Scotland, to create the benefits for all and to complement the connection of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and taking the next steps together.
Requirements on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia provisionally
Australian air passengers must also continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at start-up and landing, despite efforts in the United States to unlock the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enables US airlines to change their terms and conditions so that passengers can read, see or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases if they are in "flight mode".
While most of the flight is already allowed to fly this, many people find it annoying that they should not read their e-books when starting and landing.
However, Australian companies are not monitoring the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a lot of work, nor are they pursuing immediate plans to amend their rules.
The CASA Air Safety Authority also stated that the announcement would be viewed, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," it was said.
The topic is subject to provisions whereby air carriers maintain safety at all times and passengers must comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin crew.
Virgin has already led conversation with the CASA about an extension of her Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and explains that it is open to changes, but they had to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (no wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Quantas explained that the current rules will remain in place until now.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices may not be used at startup and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly see the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision varies according to the age of the fleet in US companies.
You have to prove that your aircraft can tolerate radio interference by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After a carrier has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can passengers using more portable, easier electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases, the crew will show the passengers in a bad view while the landing will turn off the devices.
In addition, the group recommended that heavy equipment should be stolen safely under the seat or in the boxes above the seat when starting and landing.
In front of the district village against Schalke, accompanying BVB trailers with light-tracts had taken care of ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced serious consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football league against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost speculative acoustic, which offered the viewer until just before the beginning of the federal league game between the German Vizemeister Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
The guests were mostly listening with their songs.
On the other hand, where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, the southern triangles first presented themselves to be extremely quiet: no songs, no battles.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinated the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And right in front of the tribune, a big flag with the title "Station Ban Section".
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB players entered the place, short-term jubilee burned up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and crying shals - but not everywhere for a long time.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribune, nothing happened.
Even that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again mentioned the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by Coach Jürgen Klopp - did not take care of the holiday pay.
Only five minutes before the ampfiff the Capo collapsed his pedest - and until then, the tension with the hands was revealed in a loud cry, when the mood on the ranks in the stadium was questioned as usual.
Finally, as always, the southern tribune was on the row - and finally was here again as the most popular place in the stadium.
And at the latest, as with anpfiff from the southern tribune, the loud call "Derbysier stands up" came again, everything was as always.
The silence was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before the FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had hit the sightseeing rings and the square - and almost torhüter Roman Weidenfelder.
The game was later staged because of chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you think Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultraviolet movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday night at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've forbidden that," he explained.
The zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnic matters cannot be abandoned.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, such as Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of next week.
"That's going to get in the way," assured Watzke.
You can be nervous about how the reactions to the south tribune then turn out.
Farmhouses tree in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga, in a Pfandhaus in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the tuition fees of her daughter.
"My husband and I just bought a house, where my whole money is in there," says Amirthhalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month (about EUR 1,730) as an administrative employee and her husband also works, she does not have enough monthly family income, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax, where she has made her exchange, this week became the third floorhouse listed at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The promise of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, housekeepers in Singapore require an effective 17 percent annual interest, which is just over the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, housekeepers offer the advantage that there is no need to verify creditworthiness or income, so loans are faster than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to shelters after families feel the pressure of rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with small and medium-income households are looking for the difference in income in order to make a difference in the economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing budgetary debt, mainly through increasing mortgages, was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore consider that the Agency has the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia has 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
People's economies are also concerned about high consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued export weakness and a remainder of the consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, in view of rising costs, people will try to supplement their income in the middle to the lower (income scale) segment, wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, Econom at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks at the gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the trend to commit personal objects, as people use the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the objects are sealed in the 200 houses of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Grandmother's gold chain tied up and get back next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhu operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% customer growth in its branches over the last few months.
The growth in the property business is so strong that ValueMax, branch manager in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, would like to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yea Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is financing it with 60 per cent of Singapore's 66 million dollars, which took it this week with the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors have gone to crossfire due to high interest rates, yeah explains that housekeepers not only offer cheaper interest than other lenders, but also not directly increase the debt.
"Customers lend items they already own, and the liquid personal goods do not increase the budgetary burden," she explains.
The loan business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secure financing.
Not all people who use counterfeits are also in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to cover gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
Customers come to us from every social level.
“These include wealthy people who lend something to a business or investment in the short term, or small companies who need to bridge the gap in the cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA saves data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Enthüller Edward Snowden has a primary interest in helping Germany to clarify the ever-increasing NSA business.
Following the presentation of the Green-Bundagsagsagsagret Hans-Christian Ströblee, it was the surprise of his meeting with Snowden in Russia, under what conditions would the former intelligence staff speak in a German public prosecutor's office or in front of a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government is subject to the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health sector to ensure that the government of the state cannot spend the money.
The Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher proportion of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut down an emergency rescue package, which, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Pibersek said today.
The 325 million-dollar package includes 31 million dollars immediately aid for elections.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to gray star, will eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas that I have been told by the clinic staff concerned, they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Ministry was on a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Government of Tasmania.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds were spent.
A three-head Commission shall be set up to ensure that the State provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would only be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public health system to a more sustainable course.”
In spite of this, he promised the government that it had responded to his urgent request for assistance, which he had first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a big contribution to the public health system of the Federal State from the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the Federal State, these elections will largely eliminate the recent cuts.
But the health-political speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a "bleep solution".
"We are therefore in a position today because the Labor Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said against ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government takes almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth enters 300 million and then does the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to ensure that no single dollar of the rescue package will be issued for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicklux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also more expensive than necessary.
The action in France of the 1760s tells the exciting story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic Oberin and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never turns out to be in the lurch or sensational listening – and there is its problem.
The festive seriousness with which the film is told also makes it for the public to be a qualifier.
Syria destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, so a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition facilities, the global monitoring group for chemical weapons declared on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious conflicts near one of the sites where toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed almost three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date
On 1 November, which was set up in the Hague by the Damascus Organisation to destroy or "inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling up ammunition.
The completion of this process, which basically represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including Senfgas and Nervegas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses, as reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in Britain.
The group of activists, who pursue the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 army soldiers and 5,375 opponents of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The fights highlight the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its poisonous weaponry is a race against the time in the middle of an increasing civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is closely cooperating with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/cleaning facilities mentioned by Syria and has survived their destruction.”
Therefore, "there are currently no other inspection activities planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites identified by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two institutions, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that, according to the Syrian statement, both locations had been “disposed ... and that the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been transferred to other designated institutions that had been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw attention to the courage and courage that you have shown in meeting the most challenging mission that this organization has ever carried out," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the OPCW, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the past three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim riots have fought against the Assad government and its security forces, many of which belong to the Alaivits, in this civil war, are breaking up the Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the observer group leader Rami Abdurrahman said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger over judgment for bombers of Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in 2002 at the bombing in Bali were angry at the verdict of the last of the activists, who were brought before the court, because Umar Patek should be shot in a state of law.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
In addition, a charge was made in a number of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia at the end of the year 2000.
The State Prosecutor had demanded a lifelong penalty, even if it was for the man who, because of his reputation as the master bomber, was also referred to as "Demolition Man", who could have applied for the death penalty.
The decision caused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the neglect set up by Patek and his siblings almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek would have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy.
"You should put him in front of a shooting command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so that I won't get another single and I'll never see my daughter again.
The Sari Club was built on the ground, when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 o'clock, a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had an explosive-filled backpack exploded.
He fell into the coma and died three times a month after the attack, while he was hanging on a life-saving system.
Hughes said that Patek earned the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were directed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty first and foremost.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber standing before the court.
He took up nearly a decade of detention, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with the goal of re-establishing the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't sit down," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no regret about how much suffering he has added to other people.
The verdict came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek may appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Flight guests can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not conduct phone calls)
Flyers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and watching movies from departure to landing, but not phone calls, so the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, on the other hand, FAA staff member Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals as well as the arrangements for the destruction of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines.
"In the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may only start again when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain has a green light.
When entering the country flight, the passengers must turn them off again and must not start again before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aeroplanes are protected from electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the devices also at startup, landing and on the runway, the FAA explained.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft which have been refurbished for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flights, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading commented.
We are really sorry to have to feel like a vigilante in this matter.
However, Internet connections to surf, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres were still prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So there's still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight path.
And harder devices such as laptops must continue to be understood, as there is a danger of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may be banned for certain electronic devices at startup and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, safety experts for national transport issues on CBS News, phones would still be considered as a risk.
"Handy really is a problem not only because they could potentially cause disturbances on navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmitters," says Rosenker.
A sectoral advisory committee, called by the FAA to investigate this topic, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to unlock restrictions on use.
Critics like the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become widespread.
In some studies, the speech that up to one third of the passengers forgets or ignores the switch off of the device is the talk.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air carriers, after reports of interference with navigation and communication devices by passengers had become known to UKW radios, which at the time represented the latest technical trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they do not have any electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices according to the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally give significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, only emits minimum radiation when wrapped.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
The determinants of a lockdown of the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees played a passenger plane full of Kindle E-reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but could not detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he was the view that interference through the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only single reports of pilots talking about the disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order, in case of instrument landing under poor visual conditions, the shutdown of the devices by the passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who today would be fully equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Freed again by the rescue service of North Sea Bohrinsel
A flight rescue service on the coast of a flying bird, which has been found on a North Sea drilling island, has been released into nature again.
The waterwheel was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was launched by the Scottish Animal Protection Organisation SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This waterwheel was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong wind over the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the help request."
At her release, the waterwheel was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who in the UK want to make a difference to our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 leaders from the economy, representing, for example, British business sizes, sectors and regions.
Many will be surprised by the results of the survey.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are currently exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while countries in the EU are stagnant.
They hope that the government will promote new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil instead of keeping up with the long and demanding process of reforming obscure EU institutions.
The majority of the economic leaders of the view that control over these key competences should be withdrawn to Westminster should be asked about certain legal issues, from cartel law to product law.
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market, as according to the statement of the companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would in the meantime outweigh the benefits of being part of the European Trade Area – even 40 percent of the major companies agreed to the most traditionally European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably the case, our inquiry by economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain is seeking a course towards a change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a "significant change", which brings the burden of action back to Britain.
It is a lot – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to 16% change in opinion for the benefit of the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power from a renegotiation to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means that businesses have an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller by Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gassera
The start of the construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom, CEO Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes across Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its pendant in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas for Europe is stored, provides for an increased risk of conventional routes, as is the case for official use.
Miller said that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were off 'forever'.
Bulgarian consumers get gas from South Stream to favour tariffs when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinate countries are to start on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed at an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual delinquents in connection with children, before 2011 proposals against the childcareer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were raised, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children experienced.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that the organization had "never had to do with an incident of sexual abuse of children".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was convicted of abuse of trusted children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew of the first case, but did not know the second one.
He acknowledged that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also unclear in the claim that “the YMCA’s external audits in which the YMCA was recognised as a front for child safety”.
The evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the two-foldest assessment of four possible quality audits by the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management had "left me down" in the position of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives.
Lord was sentenced to 12 boys at the beginning of the year for sexual misconduct during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that the employee had stopped reporting Lord's violations in relation to the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, among other things that Lord was alone with children, she privately cared for as a babysitter, she sat on his gun, said he loved it, and let the children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose chaired Lord, who had prayed for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager, Jacqui Barnat, who was the pre-lawed Lords at YMCA Caringbah, was "very frightened and most of the time was very unbearable".
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept the statements of employees, which they did not trust to replace their chairmanship.
Instead, he said, rather, that their friendship with Lord had affected their judgmental powers, so they had not informed him.
Hare explained that he informed the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to learn from the "Jonathan-Lord-Intermediate" was "not reporting" by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the indictments occurred was made by the managing director of the YMCA child services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence, but that was "overcrowded" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was busy there between 2009 and 2011, not safe for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse, explained the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, verification, recruitment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was held until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but assumes that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth day of the year of his resignation from the office, 59-year-olds announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself to British politics, and his comments on foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of the Peace Fund in the Near East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from the Evening Standard in London as saying: "Yes, I am sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse-show experts in Charen in Cardiff came to choose the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was taking place.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago, took his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee broke through the three rounds and got the first prize – leaving 30 grown opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their performance, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his counters in a fearsome corner and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which is far above his age.
And Toffee received bestnotes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift on his third birthday and since then practiced with Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great strain."
They had to go against the entire field of participation and went from place to place with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena kept him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been leading horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like electricized, and all of them fired him and laughed at him.”
He walked on sand the entire length of the arena and even though he looked so small, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farmyards and has two chickens he cares about.
As it is started, it won't take long until it's on the "horse of the year" show – and I'm sure it'll cut well.
One speaker of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they're a great team.
The jury evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They focused on good cooperation between Pony and leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes contributed their part to it, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after a call
A Chinese newspaper, which on the title page had demanded the release of a reporter who was accused of defamation, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The New Express, located in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later stated on TV that he had accepted bribery money to falsify reports about a participating company.
Now the new express will be subject to a "wide correction", the regulatory authority stated.
The "recasting order" came from the authorities for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Preliminary findings showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several unrelevant reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unorganized," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said it was decided to “enforce an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license”.
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a complete rectification of the New Express and to recommend that the relevant New Express managers be identified and checked immediately by the New Express leadership team.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen stood up in state television and said he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the CCTV against the state news broadcaster.
I did it first because I was out of money and fame.
It's clear to me that I did wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express issued an apology on the title page and stated that it was not possible to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently filed complaints on TV.
Experts say that complaints are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited from forcing others to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters tunnel as one of the most flawed passages they'd ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses that make it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported there, the authorities explained.
During the discovery of the tunnel, eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, so the records of the court.
Three men, who, according to the statement of the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
You are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use an extensive underground network of sewage channels.
The tunnel is the eight large passage that has been discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana Earth in Central Mexico in October, which challenges drug cartels how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 meters long passage with rails that passed from a kitchen in a dwelling house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Artists Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr model want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Artist Orlando Bloom has expressed himself to separate himself from his wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (place time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and he still loved each other, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, her son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to Vegetarianism, but it differs from this in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of sage plants, ice or a strong edam, these badgers do not appear on the food map of a vegetarian.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to meat and fish, the Vegan leaves off all consumption of animal products - also honey is destroyed.
What remains may be asked, but in closer consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable impact.
"Brotupstrache is very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the home reform house, which provides a variety of special products for Veganers.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealand live vegan, in Lampertheim he finds everything he needs to live. "1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
About the turn of the century, the next step took, and I became Veganer.
"But the conviction came not only because of the food, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the art leader prefers normal leather.
He recognized that there are other daily concerns without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of the Veganers, which extends to all consumer behaviour.
Instead of congratulating Burgers, Pipers or Gummibarians, the Veganer quickly discovered new products, which grew in enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "actually, his vegan does not make any concessions, it's not ascetics, but it's a fielding."The assumption that with food exchange you reduce the choice of food options, Proctor returns to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditions also caused some to fail such a well-meaning attempt.
"The search factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, just like smoking," Proctor presents a comparison.
And apply: "Some tastes are not to be found on the beast."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
Proctor, for example, brings Aubergines, Champignons and also a few Vegan dukes.
He takes care of a balanced, varied diet, where it should even taste delicious once.
Of course you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, a further widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, conversion had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin count.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively on vegan.
"My blood values are fine, I let myself be checked often," said Proctor.
In particular, in the face of the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.
"Because animals are fed with feed instead of grass on the grass, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 is high," says Proctor.
For Vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
A wide range of routes did not have to go to Proctor for food purchase.
There are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soyamilch and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find the place.
Just out and I'll buy something special.
"Many people ignore the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this way also applies to "normal" finished products."
However, the preparation of vegan courts was far more favourable and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small knuckles you can do good if you don't partially achieve better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little bit more back powder and carbonic acid instead of eggs, with his vegan cassettes, Proctor could also bring his grandparents to the ground.
The Veganer family feast gives a new kiss.
It has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise in this are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was already confronted with Skeptics.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"If I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions you have to act like a Veganer with a fingertip feeling.
"I don't deny the people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to get an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world seems not as vegan as likely - and the Vegan is not as limited as usual.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's Pommes everywhere!
"Many donors offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he turns out on pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow on it.
"When I started feeding my vegan 13 years ago, it was even more difficult for me," the New Zealand country could discover a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them pay attention to it."
"If enough requests come, they may be inclined to supplement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the Mannheim Kombüse or the Café Birdfree.
Proctor wishes other restaurants to have at least one vegan court on the menu.
In fact vegan courts for all there are taken.
Everyone can eat them, so they're exactly the opposite of exclusive.
" meat dishes are exclusive, however, and in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor states.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make most of the above impossible," says Proctor.
The purchase of vegan products may be difficult at first.
In particular, if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in earthnuts as colouring agents, it seems to leave the courage quickly to follow the ethics in so many hardenings and falls.
Not only has Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scanning view and know what signs and logos you have to look at "It is sometimes better to take steps than to stand or stick," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral sign that strikes the conscience.
He may not be able to completely abandon his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers still in breath.
Trade in the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon in Germany.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business uninterrupted.
The latest case continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August this year, there were only two pans in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs sent massively defective purchase orders to options markets because of technical problems.
After that, stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to browse and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock market in the United States suffered from a computer chip at the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
In addition, last year, the Facebook Stock Exchange had taken care of.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flow of purchase and sales orders, later determined the stock exchange supervision SEC and decommissioned the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Constant: Wheeler carries 63-year-olds around
The accident was reported by the police, when a 26-year-old man was on his way from the train station to market place with a lady's bike on the left.
Suddenly, when a 63-year-old man walked from a local road, according to the police, the biker could no longer stop in time.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and pulled a 15 centimeter long square wall to the head.
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police issue an issue order to Assange
Today, the British police have issued an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that he had been assigned to Australia's 40-year-old "commitment to face" who asked him to appear in a police station, and added that he should not comply with it, threatened him with the arrest.
Assange threatens the extradition to Sweden because of the charges in a sexual delicacy after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court rejected its objection to extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19th and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has called "a 40-year-old man to be present at a time chosen by us at a police station," said one speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not give any comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange is afraid that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible espionage, after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
A driver with 210 km/h and a hot drink between the legs gets 1,000 pounds of punishment
A driver was charged with a penalty of £1,000 because he had been driving up to 210 km/h and a hot line between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27th with his Mercedes Benz at A120 at Braintree.
After the police had stopped him, they discovered the cup between his legs.
Before the court-martial Colchester, Howie was guilty of not taking the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of £90 and a victim's allowance of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasurer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on apartments that cost more than two million pounds, and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as companies and not as individuals.
The income from the stamp tax for housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were at 708 million pounds in 2012/13, is already higher than the income for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increase in stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against a treatment, high-quality properties can be claimed to be too low, regardless of the impact of the old community tax system.”
"But this step could make some foreign investors withhold, as regards the purchase of property in London, or the sale of its owners," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the apartment market at price – have been valued by the record value of 11.8% last year in the well-inhabited London Southwest Gürtel, ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by a rising domestic market, where the south-west part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, as a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context of a dog's snoring with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail spread more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say other dogs can see these subtle differences and react to it.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscience scientist at the University of Trent, said: “People are well aware that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli, causing positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral fungi of their species, the researchers monitor the animals while these films look at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four bones and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the tail moves one way or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate derogating other aspects, so we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or the right.”
When the animals saw how a different voiceless dog moved the tail to the right (as seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But the snorkeling was mainly left (from the perspective of the dog that welded), and their heart rate rose and they looked uneasy.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not communicate intentionally through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wealing with the tail is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health of Bristol explained that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right of the dog was important.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their head left when they see an aggressive dog and right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was: “The dogs go to a robot dog if he’s ‘swanz’ on the left and not on the right, instead of becoming restless – just different from in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore lead to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“Although there are significant evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” says Bradshaw.
Since her behavior is easy to record, it will probably not last long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys move performance in Glasgow due to Alex Turners' disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band has moved a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer has been diagnosed with convulsions.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
Because of the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert needs to be postponed.
The announcement of the band came after she had to move a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys reported: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with convulsions, which is why he cannot appear."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now held on 20 November, which was placed in the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
Keep all tickets for this show validity.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences caused by this.

Pope Francis named the first Cardinal in February
Pope Francis was first called a new cardinal of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also those who choose a Pope, so that Francis will name the first group of men who will finally be involved in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer take part in the papal chair – this is true of a group of 120 "elected cardinals".
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals will be held, which is also known as the Consistorium.
"Papst Franciskus has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistency in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of Cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably be reduced until February.
He explained that a pope normally respects as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals will be 120 again, and so many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The Consistency next year is therefore important because it has been the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a certain overlap on the part of Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will remove Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called after the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was "possible", that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we haven't been in this position – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from great places would be called cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he calls.
GM calls for new pickup trucks in the United States to repair the seats
General Motors calls back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat, as a communication from the US regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directive on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
“When driving from the back of the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraints do not protect the seats properly so that there is an increased risk of injury” was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The returned models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the main starting point for the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter due to the 16-day government Shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the model year 2014, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, explained GM on Friday.
In October, GM 42,660 sold Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share rose by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange.
Double-declining depreciation [d]
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been abandoned by the Republican block-attack.
Blockage policy does not blame Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about election 2008 were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible sad book right now.
It's a book that I believed would raise me during the troubled second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and depicts the memoirs Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I am finished with my patient subscriptions in the evening and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and for a reason could steal the breath.
The election was held as an Earth victory and a news speaker to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried out for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office at the time in 2008, he had 82% acceptances.
And then I close the book.
To switch again to the present is a bad wake, as if to break out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first delivered my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and varied things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Disease Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the party block-attack has made too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few.
But once I have defended Obama's government from colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I am at the end of my attempts to explain it.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican Blockage Policy cannot explain why it allows the removal of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in the overseas region.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why Whistleblowers are being punished to reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without procedures and why public funding and spending limits are being met during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, in which the efforts of the White House to calm the media are the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years after the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
I should have understood with 18 that government work could be contrary to its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the deputy's name is not a predictable course, since an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre mark the public debate.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And most of all, it bothers me.
I chose Obama in 2012 again, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
In the midst of Romney, a confusing and unexplained alternative seemed to be unable to determine his direction and position.
I had the impression that a second time for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard so long ago.
However, with the decline in the acceptance values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become so tougher.
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have dissolved into the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to cover a serious loss against Clinton in the elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his employees that they had to return to the course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more strongly with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters became pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining company, which is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 taxes, filed the claim when he wanted to clear questions from the table, whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could check up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are cut or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared 53 votes in favour of the recalculation for the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process so that it could be replaced more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which data is entered into a computer, picked immediately and then got the result at 6:30 p.m. at night?
Palmer also criticised the use of cheerleaders when marking the vote list.
Do you use it because it is possible to radiate the results if you do not like it?
It's incredible to vote with cheerleaders today.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy was an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously”.
In the case of a public office, it concerns the service to the public.
"We are seeking no reward except history, that is, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange office, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the courageous manipulations of the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with the authorities in the investigations of the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of 5.3 billion US dollars.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal is taking place around the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation was reported to the audience that the RBS forwarded the recordings of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier trader to the UK Supervisory Authority, which was the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is currently going to be authorised from his current position as European leader of the Forex Spot Trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was granted this week and Matt Gardiner, former head of currency at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were subjected to any misbehaviour.
To Usher's immediate message group, bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation was close to people.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had stated that it was investigating a moderate manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with concerns about which banks should have agreed on in transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks get through instant messages and e-mails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
News of these investigations has alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the business and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the advanced and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange exchange, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks would lead to the fact that "the market can already be affected by very low ticket prices".
The message came out on the same day as Credit Suisse announced, she announced this week a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Fund offices after he had lost almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is resolved," said Credit Suisse.
Paints the building on the base of the Bechtle
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss Wiese" has decorated the building on the Bechtle Foundation at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and spread the walk, which is in a press release.
The planned coverage of the falling house in the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the site was threatened to be removed.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Prior to the operation of the BI, a transparent with the message "We are for it".
However, the approximately 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative were slightly disturbed by their action.
Her motto on the big poster was called "We are against Bauruins".
So she wanted to point to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In a conversation with many passengers before the "Building" it was clear that some citizens believe that it will go much better with the implementation of the project of the city, although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they began to resign, because the city has continued to raise these answers, it's on the BI side.
As was the case, the mayor's public statements also work.
At the municipal meeting in May, he said that he feared the use of thermal baths, so the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex in the Swiss arena.
Some appear to be too frightened, others feel like a "pump pressure attempt" in the population, that is, in the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Ranknick shell for chiris: I don't have a Schwalbenking king
Ralf Rangnick is also satisfied with the current high-level form of Bundesliga-Tablelenführer Red Bull Salzburg, and was disappointed by the sports director of the "bullen" of the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of Schwalbenking Kings," he took the two offensive gunmen on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
The youngest reason for Ranknick's criticism was Yellow for Man at 3:0 against Grodig on the last Sunday, when Senegalese became a supposed actress - which was not freely as the TV images showed.
"A great mistake," said Ranknick, the judge Harkam referred to as "overreached entirely".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grodig-trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
He defended his German countryman: "I would have behaved in every situation like Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the scarf with Hütter.
I didn't know why.
"Because I am the one who was injured," stressed the 46-year-old.
In view of the success course, Ranknick agreed to a praise.
"There are only two words for this," he noted.
There's not much to put out.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
Frame changes in winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Besides a player, he wishes to leave the club," said Ranknick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely related to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual member of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it requires US citizens to complete a health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the State's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts fought on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also expressed the view that the health law provided by the Federal States should either extend the Medicaid access conditions or otherwise delete all state Medicaid claims, should not be constitutionally restrictive.
The appeal procedure against the Act was imposed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the last challenge in Central Romney, during the 2012 election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place is made with giant mirrors light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light to their dark valley.
Due to the low sunfall rate, the Rjukan from autumn to spring, located in the Westfjord valley, usually dwindles in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters high, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland heated at the opening ceremony in the TV2 broadcast.
Some of the people of the valley stood up to sunglasses, while others set up sunglasses.
So far, in winter, the sun was hungry with a cable train on a nearby summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to link the beams with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about EUR 615,000).
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpine resort Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
Post almost no more Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for the Sunday break are still on different mailboxes of the city and the city parts, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the break on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP reports.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building is taught in Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in Jakob-Müller Street 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is also taught on Sundays, the answer to the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to imitate this.
The Sunday lesson is an important post office.
"This business is radically and insurmountable despite the increase in prices for letters in January 2013.
Thomas Bittner, president of the Group and of the Association of Liberals, supports his colleagues in the Group: "What bothers me is the fact that here the eras of exile will be changed or also destroyed by the slander."
From nearby, the post is far away.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be taught again on Sunday," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also applicable to the city of Kern, especially non-mobile citizens had to reach a mailbox with Sunday teaching also on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration was planning a conversation with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also gives him a Sunday break in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken for privatizations.
"Then decisions were made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurter parking charges are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the city's magistrate advises on a presentation by traffic director Stefan Majer (Green).
Thus, parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent.
However, the prices should not be increased, but the time interval between parking hours and parking lots should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
Then, in December, the City Board of Governors still has to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt's retail committee considers it "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before business is "a non-estimating advantage for smaller retailers".
The transport club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "by reason of appropriate and, in fact, long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freuddenstadt: Quick actions surprise host
With a narrow frame, the men of the TSV Freuddenstadt in the Schiller-Sculturnhale in Reutlingen had to approach the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
Although the eagles were with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
Soon, however, it turned out that they, even under age, could not fully maintain the rapid actions of the friendly cities.
The Gönninger made it very difficult for the hard and well-placed hits.
Repeatedly, they missed the steps and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the city of pleasure in all interests.
In view of this impressive and decisive performance, the third sentence was then a little lazi and lustful to the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, a significantly stronger opponent will be standing on the field with the Baiersbronn TV, which could be clearly implemented in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard fight two hours match.
Nervousness on both sides led mainly to errors and punctuation; also at the feet was the precision at the time of lack of software and in some critical scenes the upper party prevented the view of possible punctures.
In this powerfully balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team agreed through the great physical use and a happy commitment of both teams.
Care day at the little English cabin
Meanwhile, a group of participants engaged in the small English hut in Ibach met five days of care in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project of Hozzenwald.
As a result of suggestions from the population, he said helmut Kaiser should be released on this day in the area of the huts of the view into the valley.
Many hikers, so Kaiser, described this area as the gleaming piece of the castle, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for wonderful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations can also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Natural Protection of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the greeting of Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the Screening Authority and the action wanted a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view covers the goal of receiving the highly grown old Allmendweid field with its specific protected types of living space by opening and connecting to the existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare mammals and grass-roots, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
They need these free connections to maintain species.
Tribukait said she didn't want to miss out on this place to break a gap for the planned biospheric area.
In this plan, the current measure is not only implicated.
A biospheric area also offers the opportunity to sustain economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project and the previous maintenance days for the future.
After these various performances, Reverend Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the help in groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in the foreground, the forest trapper was ready to pick up, if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of vacuum cleaners and the maintenance of a dry stone line.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Running: Cups still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarsädtchen Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children's, youth's and senior policies, as well as its own city works, no second mayor candidate has yet been registered.
As the only candidate for the successor of the no longer candidate mayor Norbert Brugger for age reasons, the 46-year-old bank buyer and business manager Dieter Köpfler for Löffingen is still standing.
The application period will expire on Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei for Northel patents
The group, with thousands of previous Nortel patents, made a wave of complaints on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that he was banned in the case of Nortel's insolvency.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the nortel patents for 4.5 billion US dollars, complained Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies because of patent injuries in front of the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is seen in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents relate to technology that harmonizes search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the complaint that addresses the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC present phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for the Northel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and lastly offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After the Northel patents from Rockstar had been transferred, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated by patents as part of Motorola's library.
“Although Google is disappointed with his attempt to acquire the patents in the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so,” he writes.
Rockstar calls for a high compensation from Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, so the charge.
Egypt's first free-elected president
Mohammed Mursi leaves the office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt", when he was defended as the first freely elected president of the country and thus the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With its establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and fifth head of state of Egypt since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid down the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black Roben, who had his seat at the Nile and found an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the celebration ceremony, which was broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who has been taken into the visa since its establishment 84 years ago as a banned organization from the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guard the building when Mursi entered a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred adherents had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and contrary to the presidiumal principle of Mubarak time, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the convoy could cross the normally inhabited road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "Erastrad" of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a speech of freedom, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all of them who wanted to target the rebellion from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi explained to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he placed the office in a blue suit with red tie.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he should have his address.
He was officially welcomed by an army band who played the national anthem that he heard in port.
Military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of audiences in the largest auditorium of the university with speakers from "The Army and the People are a Hand".
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as the foundation of secular education, has developed into a high school of Islamic students in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi laid a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the rebellion, which led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule, and he promised to reclaim the presidential powers that the military council had assumed from the head of state under the authority.
However, with the abolition of official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he submits to the military's will, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursis spoke on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides for two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discothek "Blue Velvet" began.
Today's Friday evening it's called "Pump this party", tomorrow's Saturday evening it goes on with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on two days.
Workers crashed by leaders: serious injury
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg was injured by a manager and injured himself.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor at the outside front of a guest house.
When he went up to the leader of the roof, he ran away and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought with the rescue screwer "Christophorus 6" to the Salzburg National Hospital.
Violent in South Africa: twice lifelong prison
Nine months after the brutal rape and torture of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two lifetimes on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC.
The victim was later killed as a result of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had triggered national conceptions.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anne Boyysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but were guilty.
The sight of the young people was so enthusiastic that the caregivers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to be in a bar at night with booys.
He was also able to beat and rape them, but he contends to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police first came out of several cases, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The public prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Violations in South Africa are almost every day: there are about 64 000 ads every year because of sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as many as in Germany, but with 82 million people who have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of darkies in sexual violence at the 10th to 25th.
Jumbo visits the black forest of ham
Jumbo was looking for the "best ham of the world": The Pro7-Star Bondorf visited the TV show "Galileo".
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important for the ham are the pigs, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can hams, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli as the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the way in which the company "Adler" works in Bonddorf.
"Deutschland's favorite hamken", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest hamken.
Only with hair protection and kittel comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can get to the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening fast limbis in forestshut
"Here I have a great deal of work here," said the TVmakers, Schinken Black Forests as a mass product.
16,000 cells per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat part, color: Uli explains what it comes to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered for six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the flesh, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited when you put Roberto Blanco on, what happens then," says Jumbo.
The level of private television is presented here in Reinkultur.
But the look is worth it.
The viewer sees that the collapse of the cages is still handwork.
Because: Black forest hamken is traditionally found without bones in the regal.
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo of an "U-boot" optically.
The trick: Dentists here provide smoke for the special taste of the black forest of Schinkens.
20 days of smoking make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc in the jumbo disappears," he announces the test food.
"It's really nice," said the TV star's fait.
This will enable all stakeholders to live.
Did you think travel offices belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now accounts for an adjusted annual tax profit of between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As manager Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are in a good way towards record revenue before interest and taxes," he explained.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure sector has recovered in the second half of the year, which is a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, there was a good deal for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while here the business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered from the slower first half of the season, so a profit for the year is expected for the third year as a result.
The shares of the Flight Centre increased by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th - century novel, romantic lyric and contemporary British novels since 1914.
The test also includes "invisible texts" entry to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to carry out an independent GCSE examination for language, with strong incentive to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curriculum for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core areas will be amended next year.
In a separate initiative, Offqual, the supervisory authority for examinations, will announce a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new system of use and less course work.
In a summer speech, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our testing system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and stringent".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour plan, from coalition circles it means that the comprehensive math test – combined with a stronger weighting of the specialist in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
The teaching plan focuses more on "problems from the right life", including financial mathematics.
Lovely animals and sweet torts
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colors presents the circuit performance show this weekend in the civil house.
The evaluations were already carried out on Thursday
The local association W514 is again directing this large exhibition.
Here breeders of the soest associations show their best animals as well as young Viking hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges presented the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to award excellent animals.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Talk Forum
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, it is the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Discussions for Today's Treatment with the Last Things".
The rapporteur is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church Community Salem, the Palace Salem and the Cultural Office of the Land Seekreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to go to the forum of the question, as people today do the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much of it in the past centuries and put it on those pictures of heaven and hell that "have shaped our ideas to this day", then the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of fulfillment is more marked by a certain embarrassment or even languagelessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out by religious criticism by Christians and Christians," says the rapporteur.
It has "provided us with so many questions that the call sign has come down to us".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the problem of death."
This is linked to the question of that desire, "that dreams that everything will be good at the end."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg.
She promoted Dr. theol. in 1997 and also in Freiburg.
The qualification for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a teaching chair for Systematic Theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleinen Heuberg confirm their faith in the establishment
In two services 101 15 and 16-year-old young people of the soul care unit At Kleinen Heuberg were established.
The service accompanied the group Laudato-Si in the morning of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the receiving of the firmament, the young men said yes to their baptism and despised the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firms had prepared themselves in the past months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the support of numerous members of the community on the big holiday.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared the youth day in underground.
Illmensee: 2nd Mountain Bike Racing Enthralled Participants
At great weather, 214 bikers came to Illmensee to manage the round course over the hills around the lake.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the sporting association Illmensee.
The participants included, in particular, at a short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 meters high, also numerous bikers who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Forestsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
Both of them were expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time to the goal and defend his title as a total winner of the short distance.
In place two were able to re-place Pascal Truubel.
At the ladies' house, there was Theresa Duelli from the team's room, which made it on the top of the winner's stairs.
Two and three of them came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A happy development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole band was represented by athletes.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to more than 70 years in the oldest beginners.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute topats at the beginning.
Four drivers were able to stop from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a Mountainbike help professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl was a two-time world champion in the 12-hour class together with a teammate.
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline.
This also includes Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls himself two German masters in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 meters of height, it reached a tipping finish in the finish line in front of the three-seas hall.
Pangerl ran over the target line as the first one.
Only a second later, Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann became the third party of the overall evaluation.
In the ladies' rating, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was secure by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Roads through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 by a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then there was an inflammation that spread on his brain and caused a hematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, so the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonis could not visit themselves.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered to see in Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have carried out 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a nurse at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas for weeks and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he forces up to 30 people in small buses and rides with the narrow medical equipment on the roof over unconfirmed terrain in the villages that need help.
It doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once, they had to slide the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive them like heroes: a feast, a song, and a dance, and the best accommodation to offer the place.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebration and bwelle – with its wide smile and its unlimited energy – is a pleasure at the happy celebration.
The next morning the team will then start investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," said Bwelle.
They come from a circumference of 60 kilometers around the village – and walk it.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive presses, glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for the school, but many poor families simply cannot provide.
In the evening, the team conducts simple operations with local poisoning.
The operations usually take place in a school, a hall or an apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is eaten by the group generator and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It's an intense pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They've been drumming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team then returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations in the last year and knows that with its work it makes a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a profit breach that he had received would now be possible for him to work again.
"That changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works at private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who studies at the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine and volunteers in Bwelles Group in the second year.
He is either in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and health care students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to collect practical experiences that they would never have had at home.
"We can be in operations where we help to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated health care.
But if they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle will take over accommodation, transportation and instructions.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost permanent work is not a burden.
To help others to live a happier life and thus fulfill a promise that he has given to his father is a great joy for him.
"I am so happy when I do this work," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laughter and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The old man and the sea", Horst Janson is cut to pieces.
Janson himself is an old haze in his metaerium, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't make anything when fishing.
This is how the two simply complement each other.
You almost think you can see the flaws in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman Manolo speaks.
If Santiago is tired of living on the chair, it's really at Janson's.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who did not give up and finally won the fight against fish by his knowledge and will.
Janson is on the stage as a solo manufacturer in many ways.
He makes it possible to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not a moment of difficulty.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann let the old man act in the boat before the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in the light of each: the cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise, who sings with her songs and her wonderful voice the feeling of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Going to the Romans
At about 120 meters of length, below Cologne, a sewer can be obtained from the Roman era.
If you visit Cologne, don't go through the dome.
Around 157 meters the two towers reach the sky and make it the second largest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two Philippine church towers recognize that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Underworld.
The meeting point for his tours is the service centre of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Dom.
The roundabout starts completely spectacular: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a city that was self-righteous, so the rest of the old city walls just stood there, which was not too big.
Most of the users of the park house are therefore also passing on to the Roman remnants today and just drop off their car.
But who looks more closely, in the park deck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal beams.
There are about five meters high ruins made of handicraft large stones.
"There are remnants of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schools let the participants on the top level take a look at a window, 15 meters deep.
This is the well of the old domain, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next station of the roundabout is the Pretoria, and here the participants go back down to the bottom.
Here we experience the office of the once mighty man north of the Alps, the Prefect of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippanium", which means as much to good German as "City of Roman law and city of the Agrippan, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for emperor culture".
And in the Prefecture, it is the former palace of the State, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition space, a tunnel leads to the Roman river basin, which is maintained at about 120 metres in length.
"You can quietly get a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schools assembles the guests.
There's still a surprise.
After holding the key on the box, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep, passable box.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the base water that was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, at the lower end of the mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water stands can be reached through changing peaks of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the site of the town hall for which construction works will begin shortly.
Until completion, however, a few more years will pass.
Almost broken leg: Reposition of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rocker environment is re-thrown after more than four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous bodily injury and injury to two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt (Oder) District Court.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants swam to the ground.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and had belonged to the Bandidos at that time.
In June 2009, the Public Prosecutor proposed that three men, together with unknown complicities in Finowfurt, have entered and hit a car.
All the victims were severely injured, a man would have almost lost his leg.
The victims should have been part of the competing Hells Angels group.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Precisely, it was a hunting game with several cars.
According to the prosecution, it was a revolutionary struggle and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were released in early 2012 in a first procedure.
A judge at the time said that it was not possible to prove that the men had actually been involved in the bloody vehde.
The perpetrators wore masks and were not recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof raised the judgment after the Court of Justice’s review and referred it back to the Court of Justice for a retrial.
One of the defendants is currently guilty of another crime in the open execution.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the events in the night.
As a witness, the intelligence officer was then charged.
In the center, phone calls were made by the accused and other persons who had been arrested by the police.
It is difficult for Rocker to hold to a law of honor before the court - and not to say it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier from the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor said on request that new traces had emerged since the last procedure.
Eleven further days of negotiations are set up for the process.
The throwaway company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: In the buildings of the people on the sidewalk and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, you may be responsible for some cocktail or sect!
What's closer to going to the next drive-in to get a little bit of it?
I admit, I'm happy to be with you when it comes to fast food in the early morning or at the fast food hall.
A couple of apples, a cola, a burger, and then nothing like home and bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco walkers are noticeable.
Because what needs to be missing is that you regularly throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Above all, on weekends, discarded paper bags are located on street beaches and parking lots.
"Well?" I asked.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags home with each other to the next miller?
It's not just that the piece of paper changes the landscape.
Ties have already covered transport facilities such as guideboards and caused accidents.
About what she thought she said, but not after, she probably doesn't even know what this word means.
If you're more often on the way in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after spent nights: stickers, bottles and other garbage in there.
There would be a few bags more or less but nothing - unlike the road, where no one wants to eat the rest of other rooms.
I see the day coming when the cities and communities will bleed out of the field - and the fast-food chains will have to demand for their aunts.
Obamas Retirement in Health Policy
After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday repeated his frequent, clear promises: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of notice, the Republicans rejected the President in the last days, he deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The overwhelming majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the announcements, Obama called on those Americans who received such messages to take care of themselves on the free market after a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They come with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was a little surprising that the five percent of the population who had completed insurance themselves had to cover at another rate, as their contract did not meet the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans directly that you have earned better," said Sebelius in a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, explained that the start of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Mr Sebelius, was taken up after a debate with the Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refuse a state-funded insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which they now want to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, claimed on Thursday against the U.S. news broadcaster CNN that Israeli warplanes had one day attacked an airfield in Syrian Latakia.
The objective was to be "Rakets and related equipment", which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab envoy Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia was discussed on Wednesday night on Thursday, and Israel was responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, on which Russian anti-fighting rockets of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rockets can be seen, according to which Channel 2 has a range of 35 kilometres and can transport burst heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the News Agency Reuters also quotes an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
One speaker of the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver ground-air rockets to Hisbollah earlier, in part, successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would result in a crossing of a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unparalleled statement that the US espionage has "extensively gone too far"
John Kerry pointed out with an unexpected understanding that the dissatisfaction of the United States with regard to its monitoring programmes was “in some cases too far gone”.
The Foreign Minister also stated that he and Barack Obama had the responsibility of switching to "Autopilot" when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the spying activities of the NSA.
Through the information provided, the U.S. government has entered into a diplomatic storm of disarmament on the part of its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video, Kerry said at the Open Government Conference in London: “The president and I, as well as others in the government, have learned a few things that are almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to go back to World War II and the difficult years of Cold War and of course to the 11th of September.”
He then admitted as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that the US espionage had exceeded a limit, but also stressed that rights were not abused.
He said: "In some cases this has gone too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA be a force of good and that many lives have been saved through its monitoring processes.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is intent on killing people, blowing up the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to eliminate concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in anti-terrorism efforts, as stated by the chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations due to frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who for the first time sits in the Senate and is chaired by the Senate's Committee on External Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of its concerns about the NSA programmes.
Media reports, which the NSA recorded millions of phone data in Europe, have charged some US allies, although the Head of the Secret Service declared this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other discoveries were quoted from documents transmitted by Snowden, which the NSA monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The leader of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the espionage with allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy, his authority was preparing for the congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members participating will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route was still being developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "noble words".
He said that the European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our surveillance programmes and better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to find that we are not the only ones who spy on them," Murphy said.
In the meantime, John Kerry is on his way to the Middle East and Poland on the weekend to share with them the role of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US monitoring activities.
The use of Nicolai Müller in the FSV Mainz 05 in FC Augsburg in the Bundesliga outdoors game threatens to prevent a serious injury to the Springgelk.
Mainz is responsible for the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he was only able to do it individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said Coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best torso shields with six hits.
Because the Mainzers have already to refuse the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australia’s appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Steve Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 for having made a false statement after she had told the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning of Sunday, June 10th, while two other men detained her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she was sure to arrive at her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The P.D. in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she was able to consider the story.
Until the trial, she was on-site in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison with a low level of security on the edge of Phukets, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruby League, who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia.
"We are of course worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the verdict and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on a free foot.
In Australian reports it was to read that she was vacationing in the resort Krabi in South Thailand in the meantime.
According to the Court, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could try to improve its targeted tourist image, and that is why it comes to a free trial.
