Former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for his alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme on Petrobras state oil company.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office stated that Jose Dirceu will be sent to court for charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Other 12 persons will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of the Workers Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former president of Petrobras' business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Workers Party of Government in custody for relations with this scheme.
Dirceu served as the head of the former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August of his home, where he was already under arrest at home, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago.
The prosecutors said that Dirkeu developed the Petrobras bribery scheme, accepted bribery while it was in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the votes purchased.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in bribery and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribed to Petrobras directors in exchange for covered contracts.
The recovery of a "miraculous" student surviving the Peshawar massacre
A teenager paralyzed after being shot four times in the most complete terrorist attack in Pakistan has succeeded in recovering "miraculous" after receiving treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohammed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, the doctors in Pakistan told him that he would never be able to walk again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be removed later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, in a usual morning of Tuesday, Mohamed stood at the time of first aid and listened carefully to his professors.
Even then, seven armed men dressed in uniforms of security agents entering the army's public school.
They had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all the men, women and children who had taken them out.
"I can't forget what happened that day," says Mohamed with a sharp look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard gunfires outside.
The terrorists entered and began to kill. Our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage was taking place.
Then he says he heard his friend calling Hamza.
She said, "oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohammed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he lay down and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the shoulder down.
Peshawar doctors from northern Pakistan, then Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go again.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out," says Sher Khan, Mohammed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate about cricket he would never be able to use his legs again.
They made a campaign and asked for help from Pakistan's television, attracting the support of famous people like Imran Khan, a cricket player who became a politician.
In the end, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and provide treatment to the private hospital Harley Street in London.
The neurosurgeon consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "fearful" when he arrived at the hospital.
"They spent the last [some] months sleeping in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other," says Malik.
He was weak, put a lot of pressure on his back.
She wasn't in a very good shape.
A vertebrae from Mohammed's vertebrae was destroyed
Mohamed was shot in his shoulder, in his shoulder and back during the attack, and his lower spine was destroyed, leading to paralysis.
During a six-hour operation, however, Malik and his team were able to re-leg the nervous endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just one week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and walking.
We didn't expect such a good result.
It was a miracle," she says.
Within two weeks of the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged the fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is determined to return to Pakistan, to join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the images with weapons drawn by him next to the school manuals and styles
Physically, Mohamed gets stronger every day, but the psychological trauma he's going through and now it's unimaginable.
"My anger hasn't gone down," he confesses.
In my school, small children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes out her tears, hugs him up and says, "I see my son going again."
He'll be able to continue his life.
The 4G "Super Voice" service from Three offers a better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
Mobile telephony provider Three has launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve reception within buildings and rural areas without signals.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VolTE)".
This only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three points out that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
The chief in charge of technology, Bryn Jones, said: “By the end of the year, one million of our clients will have access to a better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than ever.”
The stars prepare for the pantomime train
The pantomime season is very important for the theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of them are preparing for the season this year.
Now, at Christmas theatre, some of the biggest names in show business participate.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Censorship - the first in the role of one of the bad sisters, and the second in the role of the fire.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty."
Steven Wilson was recently appointed as the great winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson was often called the most successful musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a clever, expressive and captivating work".
Since 1980, Wilson has been the engine of most musical projects, the most famous of them being the Porcupine Tree rock band.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" width of his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love for vinyls and his programme loaded and explained how the comedy actor Matt Berry had come to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up even during the end of the vinyl era, and I remember that I was just expecting the appearance of the CD, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You bought a disk, you went home with him, you had a scratch and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example, the classics, they're better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing more to really appreciate.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice picture stuck in your suffrage.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you're letting yourself be absorbed by verses and covered by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have a way of being so if some kids too young to remember their vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you especially have?
I admit we got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the vinyls we bought again.
I started out with the idea of re-establishing the collection that I had when I was 15, but I went beyond that limit.
The first disk I convinced my parents to buy was out of the Blue from the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I had still the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately it is somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes that the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transition compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the Day of the Speech Stores, but I missed the opportunity.
My house of speeches suggested that I gather some of my songs shorter and more accessible.
I came to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing some kind of "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I kept the project open so that it was only released on vinyl.
Whoever buys the vinyl also receives a variant downloaded to the high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in its true light?
No, because, although I focus on longer music, there's something I've always appreciated more than anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses rather on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the time test because they always put the emphasis on the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the Albert Hall shows?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different in each of the nights.
First, there's going to be a version of the show Hand. Wase. I had this year, but on the steroids, with a few guests.
The second night there's going to be more of an incursion into my history, and it's being directed more to the fans who've been following me for years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the others in the tournament team are big fans of the [channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London, to the point where we always give out what it says.
I also thought about listening to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and I asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You have released albums from groups such as XTC, Ters for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I'm not consciously inspired by this, but, inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they stay in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was without doubt the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that we were returning King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the previous year.
The current album, Hand. Wase., is much more open, because we were working at Taylors for Fears and XTC.
You're often described as the most busy progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can delete the word progressive.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that with pride, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly powerful work ethics.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why work on remix was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
The music industry is a hard place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy, I don't think I'd survive.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will sing at Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his European tournament 2015-2016.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
The new Skytrans reengaged part of the airline's staff who lost their job when the old Skytrans went into bankruptcy.
Skytrans, a company redeployed from northern Queensland, has awarded a $25 million contract to transport the employees of the QGC natural gas company, which meant that 18 crew members have regained their job.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded subsidized routes forming a large part of the airline's business.
The complaint led several communities to face an isolated potential, and Warren Entsch, the national-liberal federal parliament for northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the criticisms of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collins Aircraft Holdings, relaunched Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thine, executive director of Skytrans, said the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We have managed to recruit 18 Skytrans staff members in full, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC clients.
In just five months, we've grown 100% of the workforce, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to extend Skytrans's flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and Stramster Torres, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 flights back a week for QGC personnel and for businessmen in Brisbane to locations in Chinchilla and Taroom, in its Dash-8 flights of 36 locations, starting on Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, executive director of the QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal and fresh Mummy Kelly O'Dwyer gets the advice to make a bigger milk reserve to avoid ratings in the Chamber
Looks like more women will be in the office.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Mondays and there are strong signs that more women will take up the portfolios.
One of the leaders of the government, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to make a bigger milk reserve for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's responsibility with discipline, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labourist counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a nursing parliamentary, in accordance with the orders in force.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
In accordance with the orders in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - the mothers who breastfeed get a vote power in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exemption before he consulted the opposition officer, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
Things got worse on two occasions, when O'Dwyer couldn't attend a division meeting and couldn't meet his obligation to give a speech because he just started breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the MP was thinking of making a larger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Parliamentary of Queensland, is responsible for the government's discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources of Buchholz and O'Dwyer said to Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was angry when he was told to make a bigger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding his daughter Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works at the establishment of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, the liberal national parliament of Queensland, was promoted as the responsibility for discipline by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the attempt to try censorship in February of this year.
O'Dwyer, along with Amanda Rishworth of the Labourist Party and her son Percy, is one of the three mammarys in Parliament.
The former disciplinary officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censorship by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, the liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed to be responsible for accompanying discipline.
Nickolc had recently kept the first page of the newspapers, after it was discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to refuse to question Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter Olivia was born in May.
It's one of the three parliamentarians who became nuns this year.
The spokesperson for the Labour Party, Catherine King, said Wednesday that the voting power for breast-feeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"She's [seven years old] now," she wrote on Twitter.
The discipline officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said on Wednesday that he wants more women in his cabinet.
"No one wants more women than me to see in terms of power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, in the whole country," the prime minister told reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included one single woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet, after the resumption of December.
Five things he wants the business environment from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editorialist at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, lobbying groups in the business sector didn't know how to show more enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's branches as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see was abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or just got into a suspension negotiated because of Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke at the union about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, reach political agreement and do things well.
So what exactly does the country's largest companies and their representatives expect from our new prime minister?
ChaFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to exceed negative advertising.
Turnbull itself set the free trade agreement with China as its objective.
In his first speech in which the media announced that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (CHAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labour Leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticised the Labour Party's "revolving economic shoovinism" about that problem and expressed concern about the racist temptation of critics.
"In the context of ChaFTA, the winners are, numerically, much more than the losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment expects him to win this debate.
Don Argus, a legend of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire of the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising and negotiate with the whole Senate.
The Minister for Small Enterprises, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could lead from the beginning to some differences in the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply in the case of large mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer from a lack of competition.
It is called ‘effect assessment’ because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company but also the effect it will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this evaluation is drawn up is extremely important for the outcome.
The Harper analysis of competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large companies to distance smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the large retail traders.
Turnbull now makes sense that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA jumped as a fire to claim that, if Turnbull follows the recommendations of the Harper analysis, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the entire business environment is the one that advised the new prime minister to have greater respect for the cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do by letting Bruce Billson, the Minister of Small Enterprises (which is on the part of Harper's recommendations) leave his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers have followed women between the ages of sixty and eighty years.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have significantly reduced the incidence of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard is of the opinion that I completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative character in Empire said to the Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think once he's equal to one.
"How can it be equal to one?" he said.
If once I do one, it means that two has no value, because once it itself has no effect.
Once I do two, because the fourth root of his four is two, so what is the fourth root of his two?
It should be one, but we're told there's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's professors did not agree with his theory, so he resigned from the Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I mean you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics the name "Terryology".
The actor testifies that he spends his time cutting and reassembling hairs, wires, magnets and plastics to illustrate his "one time" theory and other similar theories of his.
He told the magazine that he and his former wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as "complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional, inter-linked with copper wires or magnets".
Howard, among other things, hopes to receive American patent 20150079872 A1 (“Systems and methods for improved construction work”).
Also, the actor of "After an Idol" also says that Pytagora Einstein and Tesla would "take her mad" if they saw terrorism.
"You know," he says, "I've been wondering since I was three or four years old why does a ball take a round shape?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he was hoping to change the whole course of education.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that once they do one," he said.
They will no longer be forced to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know that once I do two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
The real universal math.
We'll check in 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
On Tuesday, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also played the "I Can't Feel My Face" version of The Weekend.
This week, Grande's name still appeared in the press.
It was the same day at Good Morning America, where it opened the show with the incident of the gogoasha lens.
Taco Bell hopes that the "Cantina" restaurants where they will serve come to become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant night in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in the Wicker Park area in Chicago, offering a menu of tapas aperitifs, a fresh painting by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of Taco Bell Cantina restaurants in the chain, which is addressed to young people, concentrated more and more in city centers.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 restaurants in the US, has roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap, fast-prepared food such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With a payment note Taco Bell average of 7 USD, the company used drive-through service and fast services to attract the number of customers needed to make a profit.
However, Taco Bell says that to address the new generation who "seek the most central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun", testing locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
To make a drive-through, you need the ground.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Don't allow yourself," said US TODAY Neil Borkan, Frenchman Taco Bell, who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared along with traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you can see food at your own disposal" before it is prepared, he told the Associated Press Meredith Sandland, the head of development at Taco Bell.
Also at the new location will serve frozen wine, beer and alcohol, following the recent example of many Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy and five of Starbucks cafes offer evening menus that include beer, wine and tastings.
A thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said that another Taco Bell Cantina location will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an inner court and a window for sale.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food restaurant chain also wants to attract other types of customers outside those looking for fast food at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality cooking line in 2012, when he opened the Cantina and Burritos more expensive menus to compete with Chiptle, the project being supported by a advertising campaign focused on the content of new preparations proteins.
If they succeed, Cantina restaurants will be one more step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said he intends to open 2000 restaurants in the US by 2022.
According to Sandland for AP, "a few hundred" of these will be "Cantina" type.
They burned the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's court
Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned Elton John on Monday night only a few days after the British artist publicly declared he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss Russia's anti-gay legislation together.
The British gay singer, declaredly, tried unsuccessfully to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, one year after he challenged the country's protests and supported two concerts in 2013, during a period of anxiety in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "homsexual propaganda" in the minority.
In 2014, at St. Petersburg, British artist criticised these laws and made the following statement in front of fans: "Although I'm gay, I always felt like I was welcome here in Russia."
If I wasn't sincere about what I was, I wouldn't be able to compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for that, then their world will lose humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist devalued that they wanted to meet with Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information on the phone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos "sing" all in the ANRP file
Businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to escape from a sustaining sentence, "cantand" all in front of the judges and detailing how the millions of euros have been allocated to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Yesterday's hearing at the High Court of Housing and Justice in the case in which Alin Cocos, former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of ANRP's Disbursements, Dorin Cocos was struck as a spark of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges about how he helped businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of damages from the ANRP, in exchange for asking to be tried more quickly and taking into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos has shown that he has known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and has been engaged in this after several real estate business.
He specified that Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him that he was working at ANRP.
Later we found that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is Vice-President, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, I asked him to help us.
I promised her the money, 2.5 million euros, the money I told her I'd give her in a lot of money.
I also promised him political support, to remain in office.
"Diacomatu told me then to help me, but he needs support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He further said that, through knowledge, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then the head of the Central Commission for Disposals, who promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew that he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I also gave him five million euros.
Call Dimitrean a million euros, I gave Dragos Bogdan 800,000 euros.
I'm telling you, all this money I've been giving him in cash, so I can make sure the file is resolved.
"That's what I told them: to solve the file, to undo the damage," said Cocos.
Asked why he had done these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I got, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros left.
In 2013 we met Alina Bica.
"I've never talked to this money or land," said Cocos.
He also pointed out that "it was noted that the ANRP all members understood before the seat."
I didn't have the emotions that they wouldn't vote positive.
All the functions were political in the ANRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu.
"I told him that I only helped him politically to calm him down," Cocos concluded his statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at the DNA yesterday for just five minutes, while he filed new documents in the "Turceni - Rovinari" file.
Victor Ponta fled to DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the side of the file where he is researched for fraud in private signatures, complicity to tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Pontia went on his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he might have been sent by lawyer.
It wasn't to be that way, the intruder didn't have time, the first leaving after five minutes, while he left several documents to register.
I wanted to make a decision by the European Court of Justice on 3 September, which explains what is going on with the services contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't done it, the European Court of Justice has told us to see each other's work, because, as long as the fees have been paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all European Union courts, we do not have a case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta, at the exit of the DNA.
The bridge further stated that, from a point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply, if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and to call it back to hearings, but also to give him an answer to his requests, including the disengagement of the file.
John they re-enact the term of office without television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch television.
And you don't even own such a device, since you pay your TV fee once with the energy bill.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that the position of the President of Romania also refers to everyday realities.
President Johannis gets involved every day in a full line in the office or in the Cotroceni
Only that, to the shock of even the closest people you know from the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Johannis refuses to have television in the presidential office.
And after they don't look at TV - at any program, not even at the German RTL or Pro Sieben posts - the president doesn't listen to the radio stations and doesn't read the newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
Instead, Johannis was glad to receive only the report with the news that put him in a positive light.
And in addition to this information self-issuance, where the only break is the access to the facebook, much more serious is the blocking to which, through its passiveness, the head of the imposing state is the entire activity of the presidential administration.
And because, although it's been so long since it was installed, Johannis has not yet signed the loyalty statements of more than half of the employees of the presidential administration.
What is becoming a more serious problem, from a human point of view, as well as legal.
Lines and peace
Those of the presidential antage are already clear that no one can destroy the feng shui from the head of state.
Where it's quiet and peace.
What's right, just after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when Sibi's ex-ideal demands the presence of officials.
A habit that probably didn't run out of time when it was leading the capital of the city from the Cybin.
And about the fact that Johannis doesn't want television in the office they've already been born with countless legends, being already people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to turn to the version that the president would try to avoid monitoring it.
Especially because he doesn't have any radio equipment.
Only that, at this rate, it follows to meditate as soon as in the dark, because lighting devices can also hide audio-video recording techniques.
Just fine.
Also another wonder from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of state only of the "pzoitive monitoring" of the president's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Johnis or his wife, the head of state will receive his continuum.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it was banned from "negative monitoring" under conditions in which, for example, Traian Baseescu was recognised not only as following night television broadcasts in which he was criticised, but as a matter of priority, the negative news.
That doesn't mean you've helped him out of something, but that's what the gesture counts!
And at least he can never have an excuse that he wasn't well informed from alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, up to the end, you've got to look at her and the mystery why Klaus Johannis doesn't want to look at the TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the wording, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees of the presidential administration.
Which, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of state in charge and which must bear and sign it.
Only that, from December and so far, Klaus Johnnis has not signed a confirmation of even half of these statements, although it should have taken place within no more than 30 days.
Like hundreds of employees, representing more than half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state doesn't personally sign the statement, they should be thrown out.
Only that they all didn't get a negative opinion!
So, in a sense, I can come by oricing inspectors of the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, hundreds of people have received their wages at least somewhere at the edge of the law.
This will also be decided by the President if he gives them out or confirms them on their posts, the decision being strictly his.
Authorities said a teenager launched an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the US
The ISIS inspired a teenager's plan to attack Papa Francis during his visit to the U.S. was rather "aspirational" than operational, confirmed a police source for Fox News on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August when the law enforcement authorities violated the plan.
The plan is the same as the representative of Texas, Mike McCaul, the president of Internal Security, said a source for Fox News during a Sunday interview.
"We monitor very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at "This Week" from ABC.
Pope Francis was not mentioned as the specific purpose of the plan in a bulletin.
the Joint Information of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, which states that the adolescent was planning to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, with the aim of "a foreign dignitary during a high-level event".
The bulletin mentions that the minor has been radicalised through social networks.
A teenager may suffer from a mental illness, has declared a source of law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving details about the young person’s disease.
Also, on Sunday, McCaul recognized the potential for an attack by a so-called "single wolf" at the level of the entire nation and noted that he was informed by the Secret Services about a "strict secret location" for the visit of the Pope.
And with that comes a great security risk... Well, as the time approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.

The skeleton from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered violent death, say experts
Irish archaeologists have revealed disturbing details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
The tree of Colloney, Sligo, fell during a storm spent this year, drawing to light the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to dig and analyze the remains, thus discovering an exciting story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, Director of Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
In the upper part of the chest there are wounds caused by knife. There is another such trace in the left hand, which suggests that he was trying to defend himself.
The skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that residues are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot know whether he was killed in a fight or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after a Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probably buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd said to FoxNews.com who planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents that testify that there is a church and cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of the discovery: the height of the young man.
"He had 1 meter 77," says Dowd.
For the Middle Ages society, that means quite a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about eating
National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent nearly $1.5 million studying what small children think about food.
The project, called "The way babies and small children perceive food" is derived from the University of Chicago and has so far determined that small people are not predisposed to eat food from other people or that others have died.
According to the project's funder, "appropriate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have healthy diets from a nutritional point of view".
There is evidence that the first food models of infants and young children have long-lasting consequences for the health of their whole lives.
The pressure for this study is that research into how babies eat is lacking.
“Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, child development psychologists have given little attention to the way in which infants and young children perceive, learn and understand food, the funder said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in infants and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have "limited knowledge in the field of food".
Children between the ages of three and six "know more about food than babies and small children", but are "extreme consumers of mofturos".
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of improper exposure to Tennessee
An actress who played in the TV series "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in the east state of Tennessee, being accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that Jennifer Ann Lien, 41-year-old actress who played Kes' role in the television series, is accused of two offences of improper exposure, in which children under the age of 13 were involved, according to the arrest report.
Officers of the Roane County Sheriff's office brought the arrest warrant on September 3rd to Lien's home in Harriman, where they say they found it empty under a couch on the couch.
Officials said Lien refused to dress up their requests.
The chief of the Harriman police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien had several charges brought to him, including the corporal injury in a worse form, after the April incident in which Lien said he had entered a police car with a personal car.
She still doesn't know if she has a lawyer.
Police identified the killed victim found in the Epping forest
A man whose dead body was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, Hidir Aksakal, 53 years old, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest, north-east of London.
The Turkish-born man lived in Margate, Kent, and had close links to the Green Lanes area in Haringey, North London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved that he was killed, and the detectives say that his body is probably several weeks in the Epping forest.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, from the Metropolitan Police, said: “Mr. Aksakal was well-known locally as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find information from the Green Lanes community that will help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a popular and popular tourist spot, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat trips.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
We ask all those who have been in the area in the last few weeks and may have observed some unusual or suspicious activity to come and discuss with us.
Super chief: six women jog between maternity and service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, there is no centralized policy on maternity leave paid in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's executive director Marissa Mayer announced that she was pregnant with twins, he was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work in his spare time", the 40-year-old woman was criticized on a large scale for encouraging a culture that is waiting for the superfeme or nothing.
But, Mayer, she herself a symbol of the top woman, to be guilty of unrealistic expectations?
How do other women's leaders manage?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Office, just got a job in the government in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss surprised her with an unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss said.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, grab your discount now.
Patel's employee was the federal government, and she didn't even get a day's maternity leave paid as part of her work contract.
At the time, Patel was unmarried and very focused on his career, and the family was the last thing he was thinking about.
But she listened to her boss' advice.
He avoided using his days of medical leave for four years, so when he was pregnant with her first child, two years ago, he narrowed his three-month leave paid.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel could no longer implement the same strategy.
The four months of vacation that he took were completely unpaid.
Patel says she didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but she has a problem with the structure of work.
"I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country doesn't value you becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president of the Capital Group asset management company, says that any woman employed who is and mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggle between the quality of mother and the job as "a constant battle".
The secret to not suffocating is to have "an incredible family with you" and a bona fide and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that won't be the best (“not everyone can be Martha at internal threats”) and just go through it.
Choi says she took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two months and half for the first and ending with six months for the last.
This makes it an exception, especially in her area of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomiting, and you stay all night to take care of him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
However, its company supported it and pointed out that the performance of its investment portfolio had nothing to do with it.
When she went into the finance industry, after college, about 20 of her college colleagues chose the same way, she said.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who quit their jobs, then start again, they don't have the same chances at the top paid well, she says.
It's hard to stay: "In the short term it's a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen."
Anyway, her children helped her to make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me go further is that I would like to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates science researcher and professor Kelly Posner, age 48.
Children know that their mother helps, in itself, to save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for the Evaluation of the Risk of Suicide at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great objective" in terms of career and to meet it.
It's very important for women to think I can have a vision.
Most people don't allow themselves to believe this," she says.
He once made a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a web browser when he was charged in eight months.
It also helped technology, she says, because it can stop the car and answer the phone after taking the kids or answering an e-mail from the march.
The yoke between maternity and an applicant career has been helped by an optimistic personality, aimed at solving problems, she says. From the ability to bring things to a good end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, a 33-year-old executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two children, says that making maternity and career work together is wrong only through private aid networks, such as dolls.
"You should not be lucky or win the lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, the poor health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care about each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following law school courses, gave birth to her baby while she was in her first scholarship.
With a husband and a child based on the medical care provided by the scholarship, the labor leader was able to take a maternity leave of just two weeks, then return to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashionist and mother-in-law of two children, says that less and less women will abandon their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining programs established by common agreement and accepting that efficient work does not mean staying over the programme.
In the face of the constraints of logistic order, says Moscow, there is additional pressure to act in an area where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitomy of a lack of taste (“mother’s clothing” is one of the most serious insults).
"The image is part of our job - it raises you or shoots you down," she explains.
Moscow's "Permanent Negotiation" for its multiple roles to function harmoniously means to keep its appearance and a beautiful bag in hand, from which, however, sometimes, to fall into a double play.
If she remembers that men are fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers as they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, the president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, which deals with the dwellings of over 400,000 new Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career do not mean talking about "chelibr".
The notion of balance is a bit inappropriate.
She looks more like a balance sheeter," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to give up her paternity, and she managed to have a flexible program, which means to leave early or late, so that she could breastfeed her child.
Olatoy, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 (“ cheaper than therapy”) is still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create an environment "friendly to parents", in which a child's delay is allowed, and the reply to e-mails should not be sent uninvited from the office.
"The concept and family concept have changed and is changing very much," says Olatoye.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to be adapted.
Russian murderers say they tricked Elton John about a call from Putin.
For scientists it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, to Sir Elton John, a singer and activist for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram in which he thanked the Russian leader for addressing him about the problem, it immediately became clear that whoever had been called to him last month was certainly not Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorists admitted that they, not the president, were foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was a little bit likely that Putin would like to meet with him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, became President's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov.
"It seems that Elton John was really waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the people we were giving us," he told Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most beautiful and beautiful of my life.
In order to complete John's plight, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation at a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not make statements about the speculations.
The story is based on the comments made by the song this weekend, which criticised Putin for his "religion" attitude towards homosexuals while the LGBT law campaign in Kiev, particularly criticizing a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
"I would like to meet Putin, to talk," John told the BBC, saying that although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it still deserves a trial.
Then, Monday night, the singer raised the distrust of observers when he published a message on a social network, claiming that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling it.
He said "he looked forward to meeting [the president] in front of him to discuss LGBT equality in Russia".
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one from the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for the phones given in the joke of many celebrities and Russian and Ukrainian politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well English, played Peskov's role and claimed to be the interpretation of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told reporters Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all of his questions", but Kremlin did not receive such a request from the singer.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of Instagram's position, he added, "especially because it is not written entirely in a correct English.
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written such grammatical errors.
Before the Russian duet declared himself public, local media channels already suspected that John was the victim of a joke.
Some users of the online environment identify Krasnov as guilty, known for the farts made by the telephone politicians who record and post them on his YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls to public people, then publishing recordings have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, which is considered by many as the founder of the genre, has developed the ability to make them pass on to Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Geraşchenko, the direct adviser of the Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Geraşchenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomiski, better than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests following the reports of mass fraud.
As Arkadi Dvorkovich, the president's adviser Dmitri Medvedev since then convinced the president of the electoral commission, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, among his victims were former President URIs Mihail Gorbaciov, Prime Minister of Kiev and the champion at the Vitali Klitschko Box and Russian Sports Minister Vitali Mutko, whom he dared to apologize for the drunk behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukașenko, becoming the son of the Ukrainian leader who was abandoned, Viktor Ianukokovici.
It was so convincing, that the person from the other end, whose voice sounds like Lukashenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
The legislator Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a "so irrelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online survey for readers, in which 39% of the respondents were of the opinion that Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people per year die prematurely due to air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal burning for housing and cooking, but research reveals that agricultural emissions in Europe and the US are such an alarming reason, where they are the main reason for the deaths.
The report warns that if no measures are taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should signal an alarm to public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep in the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million annual deaths, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
Research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause another 3.4 million deaths a year.
The new study, published in the Nature newspaper, is the first to highlight several sources of air pollution from outside and estimate the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on the various populations, including new information on how pollution affects the inhabitants of China and India.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-extinguishing fuels, such as wood and coal, for housing heating or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognized dangers.
The consumption of this type of domestic energy is one-half of the 645,000 annual deaths in India and one-third of the 1.4 million annual deaths in China.
But the research found that ammonia agricultural emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the Chemical Max Planck Institute in Germany, who conducted the research.
A fifth of deaths at global level are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs, and by excessive use of fertilisers.
Ammonia reacts with exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces small particles, being the main reason for the deaths due to air pollution in the US, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in the developed countries, causing a fifth of the deaths, despite measures against pollutants.
This caused only 5% of deaths at global level, but the number could increase as more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by the centrals, in particular by those operating with coal, has been significant at global level, causing one of seven deaths.
In the US it is the main single factor, causing a third of the 55,000 annual deaths, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and dusty regions, has caused nearly one fifth of the deaths at global level caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, accounting for 92% of the dead in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The overlap between the high level of pollution and the large number of residents is saying the word about public health, but nothing else is known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
Currently, all particles are as toxic as they are.
But if fuel burning is more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be smaller.
Even so, says Jerrett, "the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be given to agricultural sources, both by science and political leaders".
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmospheric specialist at the University of Lancaster, U.S.A., said: “The study even underlines the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in the highly populated areas of Asia. ”
Victor Ponta's statement tensions and more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman Prime Minister speaks of attitudes that remind of Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement on the construction of a border fence with Romania, after the Serbian border, have experienced a new deterioration following statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the Budapest authorities of treating refugees "with battle and insemination".
Hungary's diplomacy has reacted hard talking about "extremely and lying," but Victor Ponta has not been left any worse and has accused government officials in the neighbouring country of being "a disgrace" for Europe.
Notably, it is not for the first time when Ponta is trying to strain Romano-ungarian relations by statements made in delicate times or with an electoral character.
It all started with a statement made by Victor Ponta Monday, in which he tried to argue that Romania could not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem is our logistics ability to treat those people as some people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors with battles and battles.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Bassescu has put himself in the face of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's our job to solve the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," said Victor Ponta, quoted on Monday.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke of the inclusion of refugees, but Cehia was recently in the centre of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of migrants in several trains, in a gesture that reminded of the procedure used by Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners from concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto, according to the Hungarian MTI news agency, took over by magyaridok.hu, that probably internal political crises that have shaken Victor Ponta's position make him make the statements "extremist and liar".
The incarceration with Roman business from Budapest was called to provide explanations, reports Mediafax, citing MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the immigration crisis," the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs states.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian MAE, voiced "surprising" about "the constant attempts of Victor Ponti to save his controversial moral position by anti-governing lies", the diplomat of Budapest underlines.
"I don't want to respond to the challenges that come from the Hungarian government representatives - but you read the report below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a European man and a citizen, against the mentality and attitudes that Europe saw only in the 1930s-40s!", wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European politicians, he has "the duty" to attract attention and sanction "the constant behaviour of government officials at the highest level in Hungary" who are "a Russian for European Union culture and values" by "anti-Semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Sarma gimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, politicians are decided with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees fled!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and above European values", and "that we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these goals and values!"
During the show, Ponta was invited to Antenna 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Victor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military were to arrest and shoot or kill some children or women, in a speech that made more references to Nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR president Kelemen Hunor also intervened, who considered that the Roman authorities should not have a "sensitive approach" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a fence at the border.
The UDMR leader claims that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or the Roma, he argues that the fence could even help our country not become an intense transit route by migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to stress, say, that we don't have to get married, take this whole thing as something against Romania, and don't have to use it to make any worse relations between the two governments, because it's not the case.
I think any sentimental approach is wrong.
"We need to see the rational part, see why we have arrived here, and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, Roman citizens, and it does not prevent free movement between the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored in 2012 Russia's offer to inhale Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has now proposed to introduce President Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, more than 3 years ago, according to an official high-level commitment at that time in negotiations with the bridges closed between the West and the Russian Federation, The Guardian writes.
The former President of Finland and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said the Western powers have not benefited from the proposal since then.
Since 2012, tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with the representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
It further stated that during the discussions, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan including among others and Assad's proposal to give up power at a given time, after the beginning of the peace treaties between the regime and the opposition.
It proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to initiate a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.
"Three - we need to look for an elegant way to get Assad back," Ahtisaari said, relating the Russian ambassador's position.
However, he also said that Ahtisaari, the United States, the UK and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator followed him each, although they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was an opportunity lost in 2012", Finland's former president continued.
Russia officially stood firm for Bashar al-Assad over the four and a half years of war, insisting that its induction cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes that Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to confront the extremists of the Islamic State.
Antenei 3 live programme will be available at cost
Antena 3 informed her, Tuesday, that from 1 November the program or live will be able to be viewed online at cost, on the basis of a monthly subscription.
In a "record to viewers", the post of the Trust Intact states that "we do this with the heart of our heart, wanting you to stay with us and at this new stage, imposed by the conditions of the market".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", television promising that the viewing will be of very good quality.
Antena 3 argues that "all these broadcasts directly from the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news have been and are possible through a constant financial effort, assumed, which has resulted in a permanent retinology and quality focus."
We succeeded in supporting ourselves, under conditions where offline and online distributors have contributed nothing to the content offered.
The announcement comes under conditions where the TV news program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online Antena Play platform, where otherwise, the most frequently accessible exclusively and the Antene's programming records were also accessible.
The reports show that populations of marine animals and plants have half the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis faced by marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study that states that marine species from all over the globe, including those essential for human food security, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions at the level of the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a wave of difficulties for almost all marine life, says the WWF's report "Blue Planet".
Coral reefs are subject to serious risks of decline (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and seaweed, which depend on many other species, have recorded a significant decline, while all fish populations with commercial value, such as macro and tuna, have dropped vertically with three spheres before 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if ocean acidity continues to deteriorate, as a result of increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in a direct increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the sea.
"Healthy seas are an extraordinary source of beauty and natural surprise and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, the chief marine policy adviser at WWF-UK, who contributed to the report's launch.
"With overfishing, which damages coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we look like seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," said Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of the published scientific literature, but also on the indexes of the living planet, a database maintained by the Zoological Society in London, is one of the most detailed marine life studies ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It has researched a great variety of marine species, fish, brownfish and sea turtles - an animal similar to a worm, with sharp skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the areas of algae decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while the total of mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, Director General of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in fish species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae - macrou, ton and sardines - have decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without any sign of recovery, says the report.
We are in a course of fishing that could end with people being deprived of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
The overfishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our struggle to eradicate poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, the scientific director of the ZL, said: “These alarming figures show how fast people and animals in the oceans change and represent a clear warning about the problems we could face as a result.”
Seaweed: deep "peas" subseas, which captures rich sediments in minerals and stabilizes the seabed.
Over the last century, the surface has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in coral reefs or near them, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many can disappear during this century if ocean acid continues to deteriorate.
Deep habitats: very little is known about the deep ocean areas, but the decline in the number of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by marine changes at global level.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former Liverpool coach El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography in "My Story", serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague who liked "the least" in the 17 years spent at the club.
As a response, Diouf would have replied to Gerrard on the Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Medias, with translated quotes attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked the colouring people".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism he brought.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who has made himself public even before his bad opinion about Diouf, criticised the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his irony seasons at Liverpool as an example of how things can go down," he writes.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care about Liverpool at all," he continued.
For example, the way he scurried a huge and old flag in a Celtic fan in a game of Cupa Uefa from Parkhead in March 2003 is proof of its contemptuous and ranciunous behavior.
Diouf proved himself a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most famous night being that of Celtic Park.
The Senegalese advance was questioned by the police after the episode of the spitting and amended by the counterfeiting of his salary for two weeks at the club, the amount of 60,000 pounds being given to a humanitarian organization at the Celtic election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard then wrote.
I felt that he wasn't ready to make every effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian Sabah club, criticised him, in his turn, in public Gerrard and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that no one from Anfield liked the player who led the team to the 2005 Champions League victory.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "gelos".
He said: “Gerrd is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the status of the boss, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the world of football, the greatest football experts have framed me between the first seven players at the World Championship and the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a feeling of belonging.
Wherever I go in other countries, I'm venerable, while Gerrard is hated every time he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From the hero to the professional dancer: Alek Scarlatos's fast trip to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Scarlatos does not only play the role of hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, says producers.
"There are many categories and we always look for the most popular of the time," said Deena Katz, an executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find his impression after that.
It's delicious.
He's got something special.
Before he competed in the famous show - but only a few weeks before - Scarlatos came to the international press after taking a stand for a great danger.
He and his two childhood friends Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 in a train full of travelers going from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, Scarlatos, a 22-year-old saint in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may anticipate a few local awards - Friday, at Sacramento, a parade took place in the youth's age - there was not expected to be so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in the "Dancing With the Stars".
"Not in a million years I wouldn't have thought I'd get this offer," Scarlatos confessed on Saturday, at a dance break with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy.
Even though before the show last night he recognized that he was "easy excited", he managed as a professional at his first Foxtrot, getting points that brought him near the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best performances of the series.
Katz and the executive producer from "DWTS" Rob Wade said they want to keep a free place in the show for competitors invited in the last hundred meters, as is the case with Scarlatos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation, who threw a gun at a 500-pass train and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance competition.
He searched the social networks, found the family members and sent messages to Scarlatos.
When it appeared at Good Morning America to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with ABC's solar program to avoid passing through all media bars.
And he supported the "five-minute prayer", then he looked forward to finding out if Scarlatos would agree to participate in the "DWTS".
"For a while it was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he's doing," Katz confessed.
A little while ago fighting in Afghanistan, and now I'm asking him if he has a dance boss.
Scarlatos, who is in a short vacation at the National Guard, did not even see an entire show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be the only one who showed up.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ass in their hands: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with their hands and feet amputated.
They encouraged Scarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite fan and finalist of the past season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's unstoppable "ruling" and "stressy messages," she said.
"Noah is a great guy and I wanted to know how the army will be seen and how my friends' image will be protected," Scarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Scarlatos, a great lover of sport and history, never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up his military position pretty hard.
But Katz says it's reassuring that it will adapt and that viewers will react positively.
He's gonna get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
"How can you not stand it?" said Katz.
But this will only take a few weeks.
To go further, he has to dance.
Scarlatos, who is a fool and wants to become a cop, says that, so far, he has been distracted in this completely unknown environment to him.
The program was the hardest fight, and it was necessary to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the moments when it was announced on average and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the U.S. immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"It lasted about a day and a half," he said.
In total, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk in the presence of a person who attracts media attention, but it is not usual to be in the light of reflectors, executive producer Wade said.
And the issue wants to ensure that the competitor manages and has fun.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"I don't want Alek ever to say, "Aoleu, what have I gotten into?"
Let's keep his thumbs to the fun.
McRib McDonald's coming back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coast to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of the country's McDonald's francises offer this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"The McRib promotion in 2015 is attended by about 8,000 restaurants," McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb said in an e-mail about The Times.
In the US there are less than 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
However, according to McComb, individual French owners decide whether or not to serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they think their local clients want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year, with a video that shows the reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year, at McDonald's participating restaurants.
There is also a website where McRib (unaffiliated at McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the closest restaurant with McRib of Los Angeles is in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight with the BBQ chicken loft.
Keith Richards explains that new Rolling Stones recordings would be prepared
Keith Richards is again in the light of the reflections with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and other members of the Rolling Stones group could join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - met recently in London and made "clear plans of recording", as he says.
Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series from iHeartRadio to reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the group's first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the team wasn't inactive at all.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and played in several small concerts in L.A., including representations at Echoplex and the Theatre Foundation.
Finally, they reinterpreted the 1971 classic LP, "Sticky Fingers".
Especially Richards was busy this year, working with the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be launched on Netflix on September 18.
This year, he released the single album "Crosseyed Heart", his third solo in a career of five decades.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "Always Richards' voice is a more kind instrument than distinctive..."
But Richards gets excited about all the 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, the rock 'n' roll.
In an interview, Richards says the team will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give any other details, but, judging by the last concerts, the team is still very full of life.
The Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through a few difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet pharmacist who made them look much simpler than they actually were.
Sometimes the child in television shows such as Silver Spoons, as an adult, has been reaffirmed in the role of an inexpressive typical in the television series "Situation of Crisis" and in films such as "Chief of nightmare".
The first film he worked as director was the very acid comedy "Bad Words", in which he played and played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adapting to Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The script is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the movie Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of the troubled brothers.
The film is about a festival looking for American distribution.
Many book reviews have considered it a comedy with strong emotional tentacles; the film reinterprets the story, putting more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview given to our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he has always considered the book more drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like this before," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and the topics are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order I saw things, a drama with moments of freedom and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere on Monday night benefited from an introduction by the festival's programme director Kerri Craddock, who expressed his particular enthusiasm for the website "The Hogan Family" from the late 1980s and early 1990s, where he worked for Bateman. "I did not meet too many fans "Hogan Family", Bateman said dry when he went on the stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that site brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has in the center a family called Fang.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by putting in a bank robbery with academia or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is better known for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist of magazines who tries to get famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of the children who want to evolve in adult life has reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with parents like managers, and this movie has many elements that overlap the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun story.
"It's a story I feel connected and I understand it deeply," he added "and although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with a non-traditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she produced the film, which obtained rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, Lindsay-Abaire was co-opted, who adapted his own play "Treat to Reality", in which Kidman played.
Bateman testifies that he accepted the chance to direct the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in "Photograph 51" production, did not participate in the premiere of the month.
The bookmaker was in public.)
In the Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney named Bateman's film "a smart and caustic adaptation" which "gives a lot of disfunctioning clichés to the disfunctioning family and reveals the mission, sometimes of a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang named the film "a very sharp portrait" and noted that Bateman "proves visible progress and a greater maturity as film director with this structured intelligent adaptation, but never too narrow or mechanical".
After the month forecast, when Bateman and Walken stepped on the stage for the question session, the public ovated the multi-person Walken.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which he changed the work of film director, which is very difficult, and that of the actor in the scene.
His concentration is truly amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman stands on a scale in the family's home behind the frame, hidden in the armpit, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor talking to Bateman about the fact that he can't be seen.
"It seems incredible to me to drive movies," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to take advantage of me as an actor.
Having a privileged position to be responsible for creating the entire public experience, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a whole thing.
No matter what, that... actor wants a prime plan.
During the question and answer session, Bateman testified that after reading the script, he immediately thought about Walken for Caleb's role, but also about the composer Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Known mainly for the extended friendship with Coen brothers, Burwell has also composed a sound column for two other films present at the festival in Toronto: the animated film "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legend Gangsters", by Brian Helgeland on the English gangsters of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell also composed the sound column for Todd Haynes's "Carol" movie.
"The hummingbirds with long tones or get me very interesting," Bateman says, giving more explanations Tuesday.
Sail among those tones and guide the harmonious public and somehow elegant from one to the next, during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both director and actor, in a career dominated by reinvention and determination, a mix of comedy and drama, light and dark.
As Bateman confessed when his film introduction to the world premiere of months ended, "Well, unfortunately, it came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival is like Oscars on the Boston Globe survey story on pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 on the lot?
A ticket to X-LOTTO worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered ticket to X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the English Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, August 15th.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, another 16 winning entries throughout Australia have been registered, which have shared the only estimated X-Lotto premium fund of $4 million.
SA Lotteries asks all those who bought tickets to X-Lotto from England Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extraction of X-Lotto 3555 on Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the manager of English Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he looks forward to receiving the good news that the one who won the big prize checked his ticket to X-Lotto.
"We've been trying to spread the news out loud, because a person is our winner and doesn't have the slightest idea," she said.
Criminal detectives are searching the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the man who disappeared Daniel Hind was last seen.
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of that trip the night she was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search for her home since her brother was gone.
"I was hoping they'd look at the house, we weren't informed they'd do it," she said.
Ms. Hind also said that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have a lot of other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Anyway, we want him home and end the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometres of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of work for Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all of which are part of pan-European transport corridors, are among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the traffic of cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit traffic of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East, due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the plundering of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was re-established to fit the new context, focusing on banning cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of the Interior, in particular the Directorate-General for the Fight against Organized Crime (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed on the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the top of the trade in cultural goods and objects.
Bulgaria's internal minister has also shown that the trafficking of cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has taken on a large scale, being described as a very serious war crime.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to stop the intentional destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, pointed out that films of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria show that the country is affected by robbery on an industrial scale.
Participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods in the war-stricken country.
Rocketdyne Aerojet says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
On Tuesday, Rocketyne Holdings Inc Aerojet stated that it is expected to complete the new AR-1 missile engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be changed if it does not receive sufficient funds from the US government.
The Vice-President of the Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements about the fact that the Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal actions for rocket launches by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the amount requested is a strategic move of the Aerojet to cross the Blue Origin rival, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says the Blue Origin engine program is about two years before the AR-1 engine from Aerojet, an assertion that Aerojet is a contradiction.
The issue of new engines has become a priority after the US legislators have approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of US military or spy satellites, following the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck claims that Aerojet test hardware for engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit both in the Atlas 5 of ULA rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and in the new Vulcan rocket that develops ULA and costs about $1 billion.
The aircraft says it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as ULA is currently planning.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet was planning to start testing engines on a large scale in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be delayed if the company does not receive sufficient funds from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first half of the tax year 2016 beginning in October.
She adds that the whole company was eager to see how the Air Force will share a funding of approximately USD 160 million between rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was planning to try other private financing options for the engine, but did not offer details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding, and the Air Force covers two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both of which are private companies, have self-financed the engine creation process and they say they are not looking for secure government funding.
AB InBev Beverage Company intends a 275 billion-dollar merger with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest brewing company, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) about a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the world's total quantity of brewing.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately USD 275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev's dominance in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also with their factories of beer from Asia.
"The true attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also some places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, a company located on the second world market and producing over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that he was informed of AB InBev's intention to make an offer to him, which must happen by 14 October, in accordance with British laws.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing the cost of marketing socoteal, has previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, the ketchup producer Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
An appropriate source of SAB mentioned that it is too early to say what it will do, as they have not received any offer.
"At this point, we are at the stage waiting and deciding," the source said.
Speculations on a merger, which would most likely raise concerns about the infringement of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have been circulating for several years.
The time to approach, after better than a decade of acquisitions made by AB InBev, is followed by a decrease of approximately 15% of the price of SABMiller shares from August.
"It's exactly the moment they were expecting," said analyst Phil Gorham from Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it has logic.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) for SAB Miller, perhaps even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to USD 130 billion, which would also include the SABMiller debt.
This would make the most significant M&A transaction in 2015, which already announces a record year after the 2008 financial crisis from the point of view of the amount of the transaction, and one of the largest acquisitions in 1980 here.
The SAB shares approached 19.9% at 36.14 lire, giving it a stock exchange of $90 billion.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
Rivali Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (Carlb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could seek another merger as defence strategies, as it happened in the previous year when he offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottle bottle bottle with the Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been a ban on a combination with Diageo or with Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The global market share of AB InBev's bery market, Budweiser producer, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to the Plato Logic industry experts.
AB InBev intends to report between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) of 2 times, from 2.5 of the present.
It is possible to reach the target in 2016, the closest realistic date to which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would have a way to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought Budweiser's company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with USD 52 billion, the largest purchase of ice money in history at that time. He let the report grow more than 5 times.
An as big as that would allow them to collect a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev hold a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders from SABMiller are the tobacco producer Altria (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altria refused to make statements about the fact that they had been approached by AB InBev, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at a conference of analysis that he regularly assessed the investment in SABMiller and that "this time we consider the maintenance of the assets to be in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, head of European Investment, equity, at Alliance Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, says AB InBev has faced an increasing pressure to return the excess of cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debts reaches about 15% somewhere.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage of 8% after 10 years," Dwane said.
In the case of any combination, there are significant weights related to the infringement of competition rules, in particular in the United States, where companies hold approximately 70% of the beer market.
"Economys that could be done in distribution operations are large, and the gaps in competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at the Ross Business School at the University of Michigan.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 per cent of the company's participation in SABMiller, in accordance with the operating agreement that governs it.
A change of control at SABMiller would automatically grant Molson the right to obtain another 8 percent and to appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would have the right to the first and last offer for the rest of 50 percent.
One Molson speaker refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an invitation to tender, but the Molson shares increased by more than 12 percent at their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is SABMiller's participation in CR Snow with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that, after surrenders, the combined group could hold a 28% share of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuse a former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
The Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would have given further funds to Taliban and Al Qaeda, reported Wednesday police officers for Reuters, in a rare case aimed at those who help finance activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern town of Karachi.
It paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants, at a hospital in the east city of Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in a monthly attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and Ishmaelian, after which 45 people died, said to journalists the senior police officer Naveed Khawaja from the Department of Combating Terrorism of the province.
It will be charged with financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has further funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him is someone else," the officer said.
"Ahmed also offered financial aid to AQIS," said Al Qaeda, referring to the Indian subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded one year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, which are faced with activism, corruption and crime.
After the Taliban rifles massacred about 150 people in December, most of the children at an army school, the government swore to undermine activism.
There were severe attacks, while the army also advanced more in tribal regions outside the border with Afghanistan.
But the militant groups remain a threat, and many of them live in Pakistani cities that are under the control of very weak police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52 years of age, used to hold sermons at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army House Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but, in particular, he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistani Air Force College in Sargodha and left the Pakistani Air Force in 1998, another security officer said for Reuters under anonymity.
He later came into the chemical wax and substance industry.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected his application for copyright for "Everyday I'm hustlin"
New York Rapper Rick Ross cannot claim his copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'," decided an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the music group LMFAO, who sold shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Miami federal court, District Judge Kathleen Williams said Ross's slogan, the leading part of his 2006 initial hit, "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' ruling weakens the process of violating the copyright of Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, attempted against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the Los Angeles electrotropic duo, composed of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin" for their famous 2010 song "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shuffle".
The hip hop star said the LMFAO song is "a clear attempt to capitalize the fame and success of the Hustlin song".
He also tried Kia Motors to use the song "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling shirts and other products with the slogan shufflen'.
In Tuesday's ruling, Williams says "Hustlin" as a melody, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross's slogan of three words is derived from ordinary words and cannot have author rights, she said.
The judge compared it to other famous music from the past, such as "you get the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it is "a short expression, which all the courts unanimously declared as impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO team is an unauthorized copy of Hustlin'.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO’s lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the US District Court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential poll for 2016, newsman Ben Carson approaches the bombing leader Donald Trump in the preliminary republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped into seven-point polls.
According to Trump's 27% survey of CBS/New York Times, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, reaches second place by 23 percent, followed by Bush, television star Mike Huckabee, Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
The support of Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, the governor of Ohio John Kasich and former executive director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, to numbers of one digit.
Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida and the leading Bush family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in a month, while the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson attracted more support than Trump among college graduates (29% versus 21%), while Trump was ahead of Carson in the preference of non-university voters (30% versus 19%).
Trump is supported by more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the poll said they were determined what candidate to support in the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said I know who will vote with twice as much support Trump as Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of the Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday, before a presidential debate in the Republic.
Carson's rise in this survey reflects the leadership of Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders for the nomination of Democrats to the presidential, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up to CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders entered Iowa, New Hampshire, with 10 points and 22 points, respectively, among the democratic voters for preliminary rulings.
A ethics specialist claims that sexual robots should be prohibited
A ethics renowned professional in the robotics industry launched a campaign asking for the ban on the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, a robotic expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
"Sex robots seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotic industry, and the models from which they are inspired - the way they will show, what roles they will have - are very disturbing," she told the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires technology development," she said to Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although sexual robots are now still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something worse.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it from the face.
Of course, the industry seems to be in a hurry.
A few years ago, True Companion, a company that produced blow-up dolls, launched Roxxxxy, the "first sexual robot in the world".
However, concern about the potential dangers raised by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among the great representatives of industry.
Even in this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that, in five years, something really dangerous happens.
In an interview with BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
British First Refugees in Syria - RT UK
The following days, Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the extended re-installation programme of the government.
Asylum-seeking refugees arrive from camps on the border with the war-stricken country.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Interior Minister said the government "works fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and deserve are already put in place.
I know that honourable members and the general public want to find out more details about the number of persons and the date on which their arrival is estimated.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate provisions when they arrive.
I have to stress that the level of enlargement requires careful and careful planning, to ensure that everything is done properly.
The Syrian refugee minister Richard Harrington and I will continue to keep the camera up to date in this regard.
But I'm glad to tell the House that we're expecting to meet the first wave of refugees in the next few days and we're working fast for planning more arrivals in the next few weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron attracted the anger of parliamentarians and militants when he revealed the plan for government refugees, many thinking the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron said in the Chamber of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to the height of its moral responsibility" and receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East until the next general elections.
He added that the refugees would not receive full asylum automatically, but a humanitarian status that would allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
However, critics noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees per day, and the former Liberal Democratic Liberal Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "dirs".
Further, Ashdown has revealed that children included in this scheme are to be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
They also condemned important public figures and public figures.
In a common letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the answer to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not just thrown on the shoulders of the countries close to the conflicts that take people away from their homes," they wrote.
Rubla is retiring on the global uncertainty fund - RT Business
The Russian Rubla increased on Wednesday, being traded with 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Bursa at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say the return of the rubble was due to the investor's reaction to the current global market disturbances produced by Chinese weights, the possible increase in the US Federal Reserve's earnings and the excessive reaction to cheap oil.
Brent quotas increased by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching 48.36 USD per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) has traded 72 cents more at 45.31 USD per barrel.
OTHER MULTS: Most likely, the interest rate will increase in the USA by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"Vulnerability is possible to say the word, fuelled by uncertainty about China and by the rise in the rate of federal profits, which will continue to give the tone for oil and rubble prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, an expert in monetary policy strategies in the emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are linked to the US dollar, began to buy rubles.
Global markets await with the soul at the mouth the Federal Reserve's decision of Thursday, whether it will increase or not the interest rate.
The markets consider that what could not be the first growth in the nine-year US interest rate and traded at higher Wednesdays.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the U.S. government and with companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephony company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet to be established at EU level.
The collaboration comes as a result of a very widespread non-cooperating with regard to the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes the potential negative effect in live colours.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies by delivering products or catching data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," the research mentions.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to this O'Cathain, Baroness of the Chamber of the Lorzs, concern has increased on the basis of reports on events at the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones over football stadiums, near nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, more than 400 calls to the Metropolitan Police have been linked to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
Which is the solution: to build a system that follows all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, whether driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As more and more small drones operate commercial flights at low altitude, beyond the visibility level of the pilot, or even fully autonomous flights, there is a need for some air traffic management infrastructure to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of collection in the city," she said.
According to NASA, this drone traffic management system will include services such as air space design, methods to avoid unfavourable weather conditions and wind, congestion management, route planning and redirection by similar methods with rules for road traffic such as signs and bands.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is going to explode in the European Union in the coming years.
"We already see small and innovative SMEs in the UK that use this technology with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and the media industries," says Lord Tariq.
In 2014, only 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
The Dislike button: why does Facebook want to know what is happening to you?
"A Look Back" works similarly, collecting the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - about US$ 240 billion after the latest statistics - is due to the unimaginable amount of data about the consumers it holds.
Each interaction, postage, appreciation and friendship you make is gathered and build a remarkable picture of a complex, located in a permanent update, about your person and the preferences you have.
This is especially valuable for advertising agents, who can use all this information to choose carefully what people see on Facebook ads, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and, of course, opens a door for another type of advertising agent to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charitable organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "empathize" with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see in News.
Facebook uses incredibly intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that vast content universe that you can see, in the smaller stream that you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you thought was interesting in the past and, above all, on what you liked.
There is no doubt that there is a fear on Facebook that many interesting posts, but unhappy ones do not enter the algorithm, because people don't feel that they should be appreciated.
But if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it might decide to remove this kind of post from News.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, above all, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
The academic environment representatives call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds strange, it is probably just a simple trial of Facebook (and published, with their agreement) to better understand the way their platform works and whether they can adjust the algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen with the empathy button stays on Facebook.
The real challenge is how the decision of a single company to add a single button to its services can produce so many speculations.
The reason for this may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another one that is leading a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of social technology and networks.
The decisions it takes, including with regard to the new buttons, will be the most appropriate ones to remain on the ground in this course.
I think a lot of people can empathize with this and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric hugs can anticipate crises in people with autism
Over the course of ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have determined that the body's signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, giving the assistants the opportunity to take the appropriate measures.
The kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that his head hurts or that "there's too much noise here" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body transmits to us, and we need to do this in a gentle and unintrusive way.
For example, simple color visualization in an application can show the level of agitation. The red can be used to warn about behavioral changes, and blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant understanding that the person is tired and needs stimulation.
The data from the brochures can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping the caregivers to understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with manufacturers to further develop this technology, to be specific to autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of services for customers from the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we work, you see the spectacular difference that can lead to the quality of their life's assistance technology. Now, the apps for iPad give, in their own, a voice of people who have never spoken.
Robots help the autistic children learn to play to hide.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistive technologies can really change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charity for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and they are also part of the discussion of how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air raids on the targets of Isis in Syria, announced on Wednesday the government, just days after President François Hollande said the intervention was a "necessary".
France will launch the first air attacks on the jihadist group Islamic State in Syria "in the coming weeks", Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
French air forces are conducting recognition missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow "in the coming weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian said for France Inter radio station.
Le Drian said in parliament on Tuesday that the Islamic State made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern region of Aleppo.
"In the town of the Great there is an extremely powerful offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what remains of it," he said.
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition, which bombed the Isis positions in Iraq for one year, but the Netherlands changed its strategy last week to expand its operations in Syria, under conditions in which political pressure accumulates on the basis of the jihadist threat faced by France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on the Isis militants in Syria.
Blocking feature of iOS 9 ads will make the phone even faster
The latest version of iOS 9 launches Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online editors - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, advertisements, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the version for the Safari Mobile browser from Apple.
In the test, it has been found that after blocking the ads, news sites such as the New York Times are loaded twice as fast, according to Reuters.
The blocking of advertisements also helps users to keep their data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from multiple options for blocking advertisements, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop block tool, launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
Individuals using software blocking programs happen a few constraints.
The ads are still displayed in applications (this is where Apple wins money on iOS).
More media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent visitors from using such blocking features.
However, their level of use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development raises great challenges for online media, which is largely offered to consumers free of charge and is financially supported for many years by advertising.
One report says that blocking advertisements could cost online publishers almost 22 billion in advertising revenues only this year.
To enable blocking ads in iOS 9, users must download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama happened to King Felipe VI of Spain on Tuesday at the White House, where the two discussed various subjects, but which were probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the kings have addressed the issue of the fight against the Islamic State and the increasingly pressing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which already faces hundreds of thousands of people who have left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous journeys, and the problems of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in the last few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context of the Spanish territory of Catalonia voting in elections to take place this month.
"As regards foreign policy, we have firmly committed ourselves to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The High Commander told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country before his mandate was completed in 2017.
"We welcome you with open arms," answered Felipe.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a discussion at tea.
That was the first visit of the royal couple in the United States of America from the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to visit South Florida.
Alfred Woodard joins the "Luke Cage" series team
The famous actress Alfred Woodard joined the distribution of the future series Netflix Luke Cage from Marvel. He will be an antagonist of Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero who gives the title of the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician in Harlem and Cornell's cousin "Cottonmouth" Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring an era of change on the streets he has grown", says a press release.
Her personal life and career are given over to her by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, but also by her cousin's infamous actions, Cottonmouth.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating presence on the screen, which makes it perfect for the leadership role of the Harlem community," says Jeff Loeb, executive producer and President Marvel Television.
We are pleased that an actress as famous and talented as Alfred agreed to join us in this adventure.

Luke Cage is one of the four Marvel series in Netflix.
Also, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will soon be broadcast, but also the second season in Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have the world premiere on the same day
Fox foresees many positive results before the premieres of two of his most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season in Queens and the second in Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal premiere.
As Variety reports, the strategy is a trend applied to high-profile series, as global social networks traffic guarantees success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series that is very much discussed, such as Empire and Scream Queens," said Fox International, Hernan Lopez, president of the Fox International channels, according to Deadline.
"We are only expecting to broadcast these very interesting series to fans around the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve every day bring the success of a series to the premiere and throughout his life cycle.
The next season in Empire, where they will play famous bets such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the premiere in September.
The new Scream Queens series, in which Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will play, will be broadcast on the second day in September.
Members of the British royal family will participate in the world premiere of the film "Spectre"
Prince Harry and Dukes and Dukes of Cambridge will take part next month in London at the world premiere of the most recent film with James Bond, "Spectre".
Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter Wednesday, appointing the premiere as the Royal Film Performance for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by the producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film selected as the 1946 RFP here.
In the past, the prizes have been selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on October 26th. at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charity, after which employees from the British film and television industry will benefit.
The premiere will also include actors from the film distribution, including the lead actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whisaw, Naomi Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will be broadcast in US cinemas in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The Christie Brinkley model and the musician John Mellencamp were seen taking dinner together on Mondays, strangling the sound that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised the happy and smiling Brinkley.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing clubs, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken clubs, paltons and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend, whom he's separated from and with whom he's constantly at peace, the actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the message star for you at Today's NBC show, saying it was "an angel who sent me and I am very happy".
He added that "nothing ends until it ends".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, photographed for the Seventeen magazine, walking on her mother's tracks.
The arctic anchors are large enough to capture a caribou
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable because of the warmer climate, but global warming has proved a blessing to others.
One of these advantages is the arctic anchor.
According to researchers from Dartmouth College, the warmest temperatures in the Arctic region have allowed the farmers here to appear earlier and grow larger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their observations in the field to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic forests.
Their analysis looks forward to an increase of 50% of the survival rate of adults in the condition of an increase of 2 degrees Celsius of temperature.
The risks are small, but they are important members of the Arctic trophic chain and the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biology better anticipate how a growing population of farmers might affect the caribou with which they feed, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants that they pollinate.
In order to build their demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth combined the results of the field with the results of laboratory experiments that have researched how the temperature influences the development of the insect and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes larger tensions more vulnerable to collapses, it also offers them a temporary start in spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which certainly represents an advantage.
More anchors mean a larger population, which can only be developed to the extent that they can support the food sources of insects.
The ability of the citizens to transform their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to provide their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies have shown that the administration of antidepressants to pregnant women has no effect on the development of their children's neuronal or behavioural development.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin recovery inhibitors (SSRIs) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is a greater risk to women and children, therefore it is necessary to be treated.
"This study adds a growing set of evidence on the safety of the administration of antidepressants during pregnancy," said a press release by John Thorp, the deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, the evidence so far seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those raised by the administration of antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analysing data from 51 404 children in the Norwegian mother and child cohort study, examining the effects of using SSRI for the development of engine capacity at the age of 3.
Researchers found that 381 mothers used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of them treated drugs for a long time.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in engine development, researchers wrote in the study that the association "was not as significant as giving the delay a clinical significance".
A group of researchers from Adelaide University of Australia conducted a data review for 49,000 Danish women from the National Court of Birth to discover the effects of SSRI administration on the behaviour of children up to the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
There was no increased risk of behavioural problems in 210 of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI depression, compared to 231 of children who were more prone to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more predisposed to bleeding after birth if treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11-16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers have said that although the study has linked the administration of SSRI with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information that researchers have had about the specific medical conditions of women - that could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy have been those with the most severe stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal, non-anti-depressive bleeding," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, Professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, we do not recommend that women stop treatment with medication against depression during pregnancy, but that they be monitored closely to reduce the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in the case of the murder of a student at Virginia Technical University
The man accused of killing a student at the University of Virginia was charged with murder for a student at the University of Virginia Technical in 2009, the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The great jury in Albemarle, Virginia, put Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33 years old, in Charlottesville, on Friday to kill Morgan Harrington, officials say.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with the intention of rape.
Each head of charge receives the maximum sentence of imprisonment for life.
Harrington, 20 years old, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Their parents say the news of the prosecution brought them relief.
"For six years we have been working resolutely and unbundled for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm glad to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for what you do.
For Jesse Matthew, the domino parts of the consequences began to sit down.
The police say there is a legal link between Harrington, Graham and a sexual abuse in 2005 in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of it at last and waits for the feeling in this case.
She's staying in jail in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with murder for the death of a student at the University of Virginia
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17th. 2009, together with friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't get back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a cab around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was wearing a black shirt with Pantera.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search of Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica people wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found next to a set of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated chain, in a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
In the period of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear if that period was over when Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were linked to DNA evidence.
The investigators did not immediately publish the details of the new evidence that they decided to place Matthew on charges of Harrington's murder.
Defense lawyer Douglas Ramseur, representing Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The announcement of the indictment comes two days after the completion of one year after Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to Harrington: they were both young students who disappeared when they got out of town in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18-year-old from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall in the center near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for a qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the early days after Graham's disappearance last autumn in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at meetings and views for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says he endured for her daughter speculation and criticism in the media that should be reduced to silence by the new charges against Matthew.
"In all this time, there have been discussions of the kind "Why was she wearing a short skirt?" and "and looking for it with the candle?" but this kind of questions and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we have to deal with a predator on the trail of hunting," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was sentenced to sexual assault against a youth in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 at the time of the attack, told the jury that, on a September night, while she was returning home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
She took her to a reverse zone, beat her and strung her neck, then attacked her sexually.
"I thought my end came, that I had to scream all the time," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took her away suddenly, said the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew might have been afraid of the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was sentenced years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will get the sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in Harrington's Charlottesville Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said the most likely to come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least today we've taken a step," says Dan Harrington.
Is Jon Snow dead or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us an indication.
Actor Kit Harington gave an important indication about the fate of the character or the series Games of Thrones, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of the fourth season.
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knows what duration the contract has or with the HBO, according to Digital Spy.
Asked how many seasons will appear, he said he can't talk about this.
Let's just say that the show will be part of my life for a while, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then there will be a time when I'll be stuck in long-term films," the actor specified.
The show comes back to the small screens in the spring of next year.
Fans Games of Thrones launched a strike after the end of the fourth season, when Jon Snow character was inflamed and launched several theories, according to the career will be somewhat relived to life.

Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Media" programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a Communication from the representative of Romania of the European Commission, following this Decision, around 120 million euros will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the immediate next period.
I am pleased to announce the closure of these payments and I appreciate the efforts made by the Roman authorities to improve the management and control systems of the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weak points and solving problems.
"I hope that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cretu.
"The extremist declarations made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the chief of Hungarian diplomacy responded.
Peter Szijjarto asked European Socialists to stop the "false campaign" to Hungary.
Referring to the statements made by Harlem Desir, the French State Secretary for European Affairs, on the guard built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European strategy on immigration", while insisting that national borders should be protected.
Romania wants to hit the Rugby World

Refugee crisis: YES without any solution
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced that Thursday would take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union summit on migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and counterpart Werner Faymann requested a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis on Tuesday next week.
At a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the refugee crisis alone.
The German executive chief expressed support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls on the massive flow of asylum seekers, mentioning that the measure aims to facilitate the registration of refugees.
On the other hand, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposals to redistribution refugees among Member States on the basis of mandatory quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
The EU Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels last month, failed to adopt a new proposal for an urgent redeployment of 120,000 refugees among the Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the mechanism for the urgent relocation of refugees, provides for the rapid redeployment of 54,000 refugees located in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, new controversies
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo again raised controversy, after publishing cartoons that undermine the response of the predominantly Christian European tariffs to the wave of immigrants from the predominantly Muslim tariffs affected by riots.
In the most recent issue or publication has attracted attention again, as well as critics on social networks, Reuters writes.
One of the paintings highlights a fascinating image of Aylan Kurdi, the angry Syrian boy, whose body arrived on one of the beaches of Turkey, after an attempt to cross the sea with the boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a kid in short pants and shirts, with face down on the edge of the sea, next to a advertising panel offering two menus for children at the price of one.
"So near to succeed," is the message that goes without the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack from the Paris editorial headquarters in January, is accompanied by the message "God that Europe is a Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who goes to the water, while a smaller character wears short pants with his feet up in the water, the first saying "Christians go to the water", takes the second "Muslim children get angry".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after it was marked by an attack of Islamic militants in January, as a result of repeated threats after the beating of the prophet Mohammed.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, radically fined in Russia
The French supermarket chain Auchan has been amended with more than $370,000 by Russian officials, being charged with food security intruders.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency Rosprenadzor, said that the amnesty totalises over 25 million rubles, meaning $372.000, relates the Associated Press, quoted by US News.
There were no reasons why these threats were granted, and Auchan made no comment.
The French supermarket chain is also the ink of the Russian Agriculture Agency’s accusations, which argues that some meat products have been found to be infested with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come within a period of tension between France and Russia on the issue of the extension of the European Union sanctions and of France's decision to cancel an understanding on the provision of Russian Mistral ships.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the news that Hungary could raise a metallic guard at the border with our country.
MAE appears to have been briefed on this decision and that it is not a right political gesture.
MAE shows, in a communiqué sent to Ziare.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced.
On the other hand, the MAE informed the relevant decision-making factors in Romania in relation to this situation in a timely manner.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a guard between two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not a political right gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian party, it appears more in the communiqué.
Hungary plans to build a metallic guard on a border segment with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto, quoted by Mediafax, said Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary in order for trafficking in persons transiting Serbia to change their routes, there is a likelihood of moving towards Romania," the Hungarian diplomat chief explained.
"The Guard would start at the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue at a reasonable distance if the migration pressure shifts to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing the Serbian territory on their way to the European Union tried to round up the guard built by the Hungarian authorities through its east end, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can relax the fence through the Majdan/Rade area (Serbia) - Baby Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government has allocated 22.2 billion forts (EUR 71.8 million) to build a controversial metallic guard on the border with Serbia, at a distance of 175 kilometres, and for special centres needed for immigrants.
The Guard initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there.
The letter with Cornelius Vadim Tudor's uninflamed body will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite the will in this sense experiential by the politician's leader.
According to a communiqué issued by Ziare.com, the Permanent Senate Bureau held a request by Mr. Vadim Tudor on Tuesday concerning the approval of the body of former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor at the Senate headquarters.
"From the receipt of this letter until the time of analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the uninflamed body has already been deposited at a cult lake and will remain there, the Permanent Bureau, appreciating that it no longer needs to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania," the Senate said.
Senator PNL Teodor Atanasiu argued that this request "is not in line with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
Also broadcasts Agerpres, senators held a moment of recollection in the memory of former PRM leader, at the proposal of UNPR Senator Serban Mihailescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died on Monday night at 6:30.

Are the refugees coming to Romania?
The principals of the granite sites, asked about the accommodation
The mayors of Arad's border areas are questioned by the Police and Border Police, these days, about the housing sites for refugees who might reach Romania, but also for Jandarmi, where they will be mobilized at the border.
The town of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted with farmers in the area, and they were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
We had discussions with border police, national police and local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I have asked the farmers, who have been working in the Arab fields during this period, to be careful and report any movement," the idea said.
The crisis of immigrants takes place in Hungary: Blinds and torrents of water at the granite
She, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said that the Police requested information on the accommodation available in the event of confrontation with a wave of refugees.
We were asked how many people we can take.
We don't have room for refugees in the community.
We believe that such special centres must not even appear at the border, because they are more difficult to control here, migrants are tempted to flee, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to establish such centres in more remote areas of the border," said the mayor of Iratosu, Papp Atila Iosif.
On the other hand, the mayor of the Dorobanti municipality, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he had been asked about both places of accommodation for refugees and the intervention forces, in case they would be mobilized in the area.
The police were wondering if we could make the case.
We could find places on the Cultural Path, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
"I have been asked about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," said Vincent Almasi.
He added that at the local police post, "starting on Tuesday, when Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, has been established permanently".
"There is always a police officer at the post, and locals know that they have to inform if they see any stranger in the area," the idea said.
Primarie Pilu's representatives said that they can accommodate as many as a hundred people as possible, at the Cultural Path, the information being provided to the police, at their request.
The mayor of the town of Curtici, Nicolae Aanitei, also said that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of local public financiers, but threats are needed here.
Also, a former border police barracks could be threatened to host refugees.
The representatives of the Jewish Police Press Office Arad did not offer a view on the question of primarys during this period, only confirming that "the patrol activities were intensified at the Arad border sites".
Commander of the Army Club announces radical measures against Becali's Star
Commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announced a series of radical measures that will be taken against Gigi Becali's star.
Although the two parties have negotiated an impasse, Boroi argues that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historic palm of the "ros-albastrels".
The team that won the Cup of Champions is on the break.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have a team, but things can change from next year," said Boroi at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announced that the process of requesting damage from Becali's team would continue.
The period we refer to by decision of the ICCJ is very clear.
We had to recover the damage from FC Steaua, the team that used the Steaua brand without the owner's acceptance - i.e. CSA Steaua.
It appears very clearly and the continuity of the section, which was actually permanent at the Armada Club.
"So the Steaua Bucharest football team, in one form or another, but in another legal form, must exist as a continuation of the professionals it has so far in palm trees," George Boroi says.
Becali's star and the Army Club are in an open war since the end of last year, when the Supreme Court decided that the military are the ones who own the "Steau".

According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated assets of the millionaires in Asia Pacific will exceed the total of $15,800 billion registered in 2014, as well as the assets of the millionaires in North America, which currently represent the richest people in the world, with a accumulated assets of $16,200 billion, AFP transmits.
The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the High Net Worth Individuals financial jargon, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, with 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are the people who can invest at least a million dollars, without taking into account the value of real estate and other properties.

"Dorel" mounted the rear-facing semafort
At Suceava, the workers mounted a semi-trailer with the top, so instead of being taught to wait four seconds, the passersby get the message "h", which I don't know how to decrypt.
I don't care, however everyone goes through the red, reports the truth.
Each one passes through the way he cuts his head.
Two boys were to be taken up by a car because they passed on the red.
"Rutiera politicians should be here to help, until the world is used," said a woman to the quoted source.
The Semafor was recently mounted in front of the Piete Mari in the center of Suceva, but the passersby do not seem willing to take it into account, as much as the information received seems to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" was doing his job properly and someone was responsible enough to give the ok to close the work, then it would not have come to this absurd situation.
The Head of the Strazi Administration and Systematisation Service of the Suceava Primaria Road recognizes that it was by the girl when the traffic light started to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We put them in use, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was the girl when they were put into operation," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be resolved in the shortest time.
Praise the Lord that it can be remedied, because there are situations in which "Dorel" has made irreparable ravages.
For example, when he worked at Giurgiu-Ruse gas pipeline, "Dorel" missed the gap that saw the tunnel under the Danube, he did not know where, probably under the ground, the impromptu, however he had not been found, as even the Minister of Economy, Mihai Tudose, supported.
Police put the tunas with water on the immigrants
On the main border of Hungary and Serbia, Hungarian bordering has been used, Wednesdays, water tunnels and tear gas against immigrants.
Although Hungary closed the border with a gimpata sarma guard and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, at the sarbo-ungara border they continued to gather refugees, writes The Guardian.
Water cannons were put into operation when immigrants managed to penetrate the sarma gimpata through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
The Hungarian police say that the action of the tuna was a control measure of the crowd, which throws water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people were crying after the use of tear gas.
The publication Elena Enikos writes at the same time that two German companies refuse to deliver the sarma gimpata to Hungary.
The country has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday announced its intention to raise one and to the border with Romania, a strong initiative criticised by Bucharest.
German companies maintain that gimpata sarma is very dangerous and causes cuttings that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisoners or military installations, but it should not be used against people who seek shelter, support companies.
In parallel with Hungary's border confrontations, Croatia has mobilized to make it available to bus immigrants to transport those present at the country's border with Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of the Interior confirmed that the buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to the reception centres.
373 people have entered Croatia from Serbia, of which 73 children, the Ministry has shown more.
Tsipras, on Greece's drama - why it agrees with the third EU agreement
The declared objective of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the Syrian leader made Greece part of a third loan agreement for this country, which also involves more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, who conducts an interview with it.
Now, however, Tsipras calls on the Greeks to reinstate their Prime Minister's mandate, in some elections that he argues will bring his political position back.
Our aim was to get an agreement, not a euro area exit or a euro area decommissioning.
"Now, for the first time, remains the possibility of restructuring the debt for Greece," the former prime minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the Elen government, arguing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece "is definitely in need of reforms", specifying that it must start with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on August 27, thus opening the way for early elections, in September, after 7 stormy months in front of the Athens Executive, during which a third rescue loan was approved for Greece.

Lauria, who was connected to a breathing device, suffered and burned to the hands and horns and a tooth from the girl entered her throat.
I was at work and things calmed down and I went out for a second, as I always do.
"In denial, it exploded and I was on my way to the hospital in an ambulance, that's the last thing I remember," said Lauria.
Six weeks after the accident, Lauria still can't swallow solid food and follow a liquid diet as she recovers from her parents' home.

Star Trek Activita, in prison for undressing in front of children
Actrita Jennifer Lien, known as Star Trek, where he played for three seasons, intrusive Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that led her to prison, where she was from September 3rd - the claim was set at $2,500 - and took place in front of her house in Tennessee.

Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar al Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he talks about refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and "in sight" immigrants.
"The West weeps for them and the West sustains terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when it says it is a passionate revolution," Assad said in an interview given by Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus argues that his Western counterparts say that the situation in Syria is terrorism such as the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept or embrace it as refugees, it's about not dealing with the cause.
If you're worried about them, don't back the terrorists.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the whole refugee issue," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the charges to the Western states and the treatment they showed to the refugee girl.
It's like the West now cries for refugees with an eye and takes them in view with a second eye, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, in principle because of terrorists and crimes, and in the second round because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destruction of infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to cast their existence somewhere in this world," Bashar al Assad says.
"If we were to ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," he stressed the Syrian president, adding that he was political strong, whether he was inside or outside the government, "we should join around what the Syrian people want."
The President of Syria is of the opinion that the country's dialogue should continue "to reach consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we break terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all the forces to join in against terrorism, because that is how we, as Syrians, can achieve the political goals we want through dialogue and political action," Bashar al Assad said.
He also spoke about one of his country's allies, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, it was transformed, from a friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria to that in Russia, accusing the West of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the stroke in Ukraine.
What's wrong?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
It is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the opposition from Russia and who has reached power through non-democratic means, despite being elected in democratic elections, and the West itself has acknowledged that elections have been democratic.
Now, I'm no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," said Damascus leader.
Not least, it included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same kind of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticised Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, Syria's president accuses the "International Coalition", led by the United States, who fights against terrorism: "In fact, when this Coalition began to operate, the Islamic State began to expand".
In other words, the coalition has been and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the Western Territories that provide coverage for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will happen - then we have no object to cooperate with all these countries, given that it is a real coalition and not a fake, that will fight against terrorism," Damascus's leader said.
Toamna?
Not a word.
Up to 30 degrees
The weather will be quite hot on Wednesdays, especially in the west, where temperatures will pass by 30 degrees.
In Bucharest, 26 degrees will be registered at noon.
Two degrees less will be on the coast, while the mountain announces a total of 26 degrees in Brasov.
There will still be 21 degrees in Moecius, 23 in Bran, 23 in the Word of Rece, 20 in Predeal and 20 in Busteni.
The warmer weather will be in the west of the country, where the thermometer mercury will pass through the 30-degree threshold.
They will record 31 degrees in Satu Mare, 29 at Zalau, 30 at Cluj Napoca, 31 at Oradea, 28 at Alba Julia, 30 at Arad, Timisoara and Caransebes.
The sky will also be in the east, where meteorologists announced 27 degrees in Botosani, 25 at Suceava, 23 at Piatra Neamt, 26 at Iasi, Vaslui and Bacau, 25 at Focsani and 26 at Galati.
In the rest of the country 30 degrees are announced at Targu Mures, 28 in Sibiu, 26 in Ramnicu Valcea, 25 in Pitesti, Targoviste and Ploiesti, 26 in Braille, 25 in Tulcea, 26 in Slovakia, 27 in Calarasi and Giurgiu, 26 in Slatina and 28 in Turn Severin.
The map of the cities with the largest cheaps and how Romania stands
The decline in the oil ratio has led to large losses in the last year for workers in the extraction of the title, shareholders of energy companies and the countries that depend heavily on this resource.
There is also a positive effect: petrol has been very cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, in the period October 2014 - July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the price of fuel has dropped.
The most important reduction in the price of the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine has saved 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than a dollar.
On the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is fixed by state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the refining conditions, the changes in the tax and fluctuations of the exchange rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price from each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data show that in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gas gallon (approx. 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
So, we're on the 27th place in the middle of the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The last quarter of 2014, the gas was also cheap in the Romans.
Then the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a 10.6% price reduction.
Still, the tars around are even better.
In Bulgaria, a gas gallon costs $4.92, and in Hungary, $5.20.
Germans put the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government will provide additional support to the 16 countries of the federation in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a meeting of nearly 4 hours with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to make the face of the large number of refugees," the DPA agency notes.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals and distribution centres.
"They need such pivot points," she pointed out.
The entire country must provide a massive boost to make the crisis face, Merkel added.
The country's prime ministers requested more assistance than the 6 billion euros agreed by the ruling coalition at the federal level over a week.
Turkey's Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party asked for a "what's a bit double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister of the Rhine-Palatinate country, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact among all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also asked that the bureaucracy in handling refugees and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the process in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
The Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
Until now, Bavaria is carrying the worst burden, with the most migrants arriving after crossing the Austrian border.
Seehofer, a strong actor on the federal stage as head of the Christin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual policy of use opened at the beginning of the month, recalled DPA.
Mircea Lucescu makes a scandal after the humiliating breakup with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nervous car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donnetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach turned out to be totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost the intruder was favored.
Before the game, I said one thing, that I wanted to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the games with major teams in Europe, we are always favored by arbitration.
There are two totally different ways.
The new one gives us a yellow cardboard immediately, while the top teams don't.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any case!
The ball hit Darijo in the back without touching his hand.
A similar level game should not be influenced by arbitration.
"Regret that the arbitration broke the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, what smells so ugly here?"
They were pieces from their broken husband
A murder of a sadism out of the commons terrified the inhabitants of Targu Fromos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, in the early hours of the day, marketers in Targu Beautiful were able to see terrifying scenes near the main market entry.
In addition to the three Tomberoons, the criminals took away what seemed to be a man's body.
It was transcribed, but it lacked its head, internal organs and genitals.
Finally, he had to prove that it was the body of a former officer, who had been crushed by his wife, a geography teacher.
"The newspaper of Iaşi" has been talking to the judge even with the taxi driver who has helped the killer, without knowing, on the road of the sacks with the dead body.
His stories make your hair soft.
The one who alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman who had three sacks that worked awfully, after a piece of body was found on the market, was a taximer from Targu Frumos.
As in American films, the man himself helped carry bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but without knowing, the killer being his client for a race.
The taxi driver told, exclusively for "The Day of Iaşi", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide evidence.
He carried with his hands the bags in which the body pieces of his wife's geography professor were passed on.
She came to Trâtgu Beautiful to hide the evidence of the crime, as far away from her home from Rome.
Maybe he's mine.
I didn't have how you know.
Nea Mihai, as is known by his friends who practice taxiing in Targu Beautiful, came to see him overnight in the small town he lives in.
He's seen American films all his life, but he never thought he'd ever get to be the one who's gonna be behind the discovery of a sad crime, and he'll see with his eyes pieces of corpses.
It tells that, on the night of Monday to Tuesday, it usually expected the arrival of regular buses passing the locality.
It is near the intersection of the roads to Roman and Pascani.
The taxi driver tells that the woman killed noticed it in the mirror, next to the bags with body pieces supported by the indicator showing the nearby locations.
She came at night with Massaro's race from 1.30.
The car left it at ten meters from the pedestrian crossing to Pascani, right at the edge where the km is shown.
The bags were summed up by the banner with the indicator.
After the bus left, I put in the coach ten meters up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after putting a bag, I asked, "Madam, what did it smell so ugly here?"
I saw there was a woman of age, and I told me to help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to the shop, maybe he's got mine, I didn't know how to know.
I thought maybe she wanted to fool someone with that gorgeous ugly flesh.
She was trying to pick up a bag alone, and I refused to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified me to take her to the big market door when I took her from the bus," she began to tell Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He completed that the woman said absolutely nothing, and, therefore, he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until the destination, I didn't say anything, because I was nervous that he put my hat in my car.
And when he put his bags down from the car, I noticed that smelled and hated.
She put her bags down from the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I put two meters in the back to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car over there to disappear the smell.
At the bus station I didn't notice if someone was helped to get the bags down, because I had lights in my back and I didn't see them well in the mirror.
"There were two bags of plastic and one of rafie," the man completed.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, she says she's starting to notice the curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After she put her bags down, I went to the hospital, to the primacy, and when I came back, I especially forgot to see what the woman was doing with the luggage.
She ran through the luggage after the fence, where there are also the Tombs inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little agitated because they got a microbus from Italy and a bus.
I've seen how the woman went to their drivers to get into them, to disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take her, because they have international races, and I don't take passengers on occasions.
The woman was very excited, she walked there and there.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, curiously, I asked an employee what she had done inside.
The employee answered that he walked and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because we'd been seeing her for a while.
I searched them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and told them she was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," she completed.
He told us that the woman got upset after she left the trunk at the graveyard.
To me, the suspicion went away from the fact that the luggage was gone, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and showed her to me, telling her that I warned her that she had a suspect luggage.
Then the woman went to the graveyards and showed them the luggage.
"I returned to the place where the bags were hidden around 3:00 when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors from the scene," the cabimeterist concluded his report.
The prosecutors in Neamt, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old professor Ana Zaharia was surprised by the cameras to take sights of a gas station in Rome at 0.55, coming up with the three bags in the car.
She arrived at the Fairy at 1.30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, then crossed him into the house.
The man was named Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday night, the woman put the pieces of the body in two plastic bags, which she transported to the garage, and hid them.
The other night, he carried one, then decided which direction to go, and chose the Bucharest - Iaşi bus.
Yesterday, the prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid her husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in paper and punches, in a leak from the woman's apartment.
She was retired, as was her husband.
Until last night, the prosecutors did not find out from a woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the professor will be mentally experienced and the body will be examined by legal doctors to officially determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The Prime Minister took over the national roads of the municipality, after years ago they had been taken over by the Government, in order to be able to raise money from the national budget in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and a decision by the Government is needed to be implemented.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the National Roads Regional Directorate was a matter for this institution to give an opinion on the General Banistic Ur Plan (PUG).
The mayor took over a network 11 km away.
In any case, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 requires the municipality to take the national routes that transit the municipality.
No opinion can be delivered from the National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
The national roads have gone into our administration since today.
"Of course, the decision of the government will also have to be issued as a result of this decision of the Local Council," said interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica.
National roads that call the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th Street Street fights the Iaşil on the arteries: the Păcurari highway, the Monteni street (to be mafort), the Moara de Foc, the Silver road, the Silver road, the Nicolae Iorga street, the Primáverii, the Chisinău Street, the Tjutóra road until the exit of the municipality to Tomești - Albiţa.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the Bucium, bd. Socola (up to Semafor), the Bucium road (up to the Baza 3), the Chisinău road, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and the exit to Carlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
In continuing to describe some of the files of Mircea Eliade's political youth sympathy, which, however condensate would be presented beyond the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, deserves, believe, to evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most powerful accused of using the great Roman detractors.
A less immoral description would be, I hope, useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "anti-legionary", would be to block it in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Criticizing the various versions that spoke of Elijah's regurgitation in the Legion through the Cube "Axa" and Radu Gyr, Florin Thurcanu brings into discussion the volume Mircea Eliade.
The prisoner of history (Bucuresti, 2003), another hypothesis, which is most interested in understanding the resumption of epistolic contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after Ceausescu played "the balcony scene" of August that year.
Based on documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the Security investigation in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, Dosarul 573, f.15) as well as on a 1938 follow-up note, Florin Turcanu states that "Eliades will not enter their group, but thus said "legionary family" called Luminića, a group of "cuiburi" intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr".
Since there is no verifiable data on the Luminita cub, those in exile considering the existence of this "legionary family" discussable, which must be discussed, it is, until the context in which this information has been recorded in the file.
By leaving to a surprising part of SRI's kindness to make these secret files available to Mr. Turcanu, it is more than obvious at that time that the aim of the Security pursuit was "commander" Radu Gyr, Elijah's mention, in accordance with the note of 21 March 1938, in which Armand Calinescu, the Minister of the Interior received free to take all the necessary measures so that King Carol can impose his royal dictatorship, suspending parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of legionnaires who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (Party of the Third Country in the 1937 elections).
The arrest of Eliade was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by Turkey: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets led by Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a subtle bureaucratic cover for the repression of 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes were made at the re-eployment for the vast majority of legionnaires or public sympathians who had to be arrested but who had to be bound by an important legional leader.
Radu Gyr's olograph statement mentioned above, given in arrest in February 1941, after the collapse of the legional rebellion, only confirms it retrospectively on the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, author.
It would be interesting if Turkey would have provided more details about the content of the mentioned 573 file.
Was it Elijah's file or Radu Gyr's file?
Because it has to be a file built on the basis of security documents, but then processed by Security to be used either against each other.
There is a mistake here, as in the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows the achievement of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that he is a pre-eminent stage, by proof, in which the person in question acts as an active sympathizer, found in the three-year trial period before becoming a "chamber" with regular acts.
Also, all these forms of secondary organisation such as clubs or intellectual dinners, settlements, discussion groups with citizens, youth organisations or students graved around a cube, were his "family", they were not the cub of their own words, as a form of political organisation and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the unadvised reader by making Elijah's "member" status (which may be plausible) to be understood and used by letter to designate the political regime in the cube.
Of course, the call for subtle interpretations of this kind cannot conceal the public activity of the Guard and no clear sympathy for the Captain who encouraged Elijah in the period 1935-1940, whether in the seat of Nae Ionescu or not.
The public support of a case in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean that the political regime itself is said to be as much as, as it is usually, intellectually retains a kind of superiority in the face of activists as such and does not enter politics unless they are given directly high privileges.
As far as I could have formed an opinion about Elijah's thinking of that period, in which he was "the leader of the generation", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigours from a legionary cube.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendent, though!
To no longer mean, but in the past, that, in any legional "file", what it receives is anti-Semitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy to be stigmatized, but not in the case of Elijah, until new evidence.
With regard to the correspondence of Eliade-Gyr between 1968 and 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, tries to sanction Florin Turcanu's claims (based, however, on some archive documents, even if it was worth more serious and contextualized) with a discussionable argument.
Mircea Handoca found, in the volume Noi gloze on Mircea Eliade (Bucuresti, 2006), that "there is no line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains no allusion to this setting".
He didn't even have the way in 1968, when he came out of the Communist era somehow, Radu Gyr could not have risked any allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think he wanted to highlight is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectable, admiration and affection without any doubt about Elijah's descent.
There's not really the slightest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been Elijah's boss.
Intelligently, the poet forced to write at the Glass of Patriots, unveils out of his seat the resting condition by signaling to Eliade (who knew very exactly what the mission had that publication that was constantly dealing with the denial of the right exile), in the signature, after "your old friend", to what to expect and is visible to him easily and happily when he responds to them emotionally after almost three decades of separation since "the viclean time" has distracted him.
There is no doubt that beyond the "mission" with which he was charged (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could return at least quietly to see his mother and friends) and that, possibly, he also fulfills it through short proposals, far away from paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr shows no interest except for literature.
No mention of esoteric allusions, of refined political complicities suggested or of any statement of the years of youth in a register other than cultural.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior to Eliade's legional line, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than that offered by Florin Turcanu, we have in this corresponding memory loops that testify to a mutual appreciation of different but stately characters, our culture and, beyond the trials of life, we find the tone of civilization and inter-ethnic education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, pillars for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the "under the weather" destiny of the authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally resigned from the refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext offered by the country's health and disaster relief problems, announced the authorities of the RSR through the embassy (with a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passport for his sister), that he could not take the invitation to return to the country.
The next was predictable: it's back to the index, it's mounted in Israel's "toladot business", the books sent to family and friends (Fragments of a newspaper, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, never to return to their mother.
Among the country's friends only with Noica has yet a sporadic correspondence, although surprisingly, as a Chicago personal archive certifies, a lot of individuals or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages to them.
It's clear why Radu Gyr didn't get permission to write it after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceaușescu regime tried the second operation of Elijah's conviction (by official invitations, Noica's demises, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr has already passed into eternity.
New coach, foreign player
Due to the suffering of autohtone volleyballists, Penicilina Iaşi tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exits take part in the training tournament under coach Dan Gavril
Back in the first half of the year of Division A1 women's volleyball, Penicilina Iaşi kept her place on the first stage due to the retreat and then the decommissioning of the Miroslava Science training, the freshly promoted in the first stage following a barrage tour even in the issuing community.
The news took little of the unprepared driving of the exit group, which woke up without the main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, just second to Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retired like Cristina Lungu and the liberal Diana Studeanu, or gone, like Ana-Maria Berdilla (the White Blaj Flight Championship) and the sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
There was still time to complete the batch until the season began on October 10th.
A new coach was first found in Dan Gavril's person, from the male team LPS Piatra Neamț, who has been working in Penicilina for the last few years, hoping to sign a contract with the group led by the Left Vasile.
Two players from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconită were then brought, being tried and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to transferring as the holiday player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline lot led by Dan Gavril performed a canton at the Humor Gura, after which he participated in a tournament held at Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, where the exits achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, between 23-25 September, Penicilina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to get a valuable team.
We have a skilled and experienced coach, but the player fund in Romania is quite small and that's why we'll also call the volleyballists from abroad, especially after the decision has been made that teams can use an unlimited number of players outside the country.
This decision will affect the younger generation of athletes from clubs in Romania.
"We hope to reach the end of the competition year at 5-6 places, even if it will be very difficult," said Vasile Left, president of ACS Penicilina Iași.
Emotional meeting.
Gems assembled after almost 70 years
Gemen George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, aged 69, were born at the end of World War II in Germany, after their Polish mother of origin had just been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for her, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being so separated not only from the one who gave them life but also from the other.
For ten years George and Lucian didn't know each other.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents showing that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they didn't find any clues to lead him to Lucian.
In 2015, thanks to the program, "Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the moment was one more than exciting.
BBC reporters were surprised by this episode.
Ten children from Iaşi brought four medals from Stuttgart to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by children who went to the German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organized by the German Federation of Sports Dance and the World Federation of Sports Dance.
Out of Iaşi participated five pairs who trained at the Dance Energy Club and who danced along with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children who were expelled participated in five different categories (youths 1 and 2 June 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the pairs: Rázvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Târzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Śtefana Gologan (the bronze medal).
And the other three pairs managed to occupy the front seats: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Iona Iosub Cujb, and not least the couple Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionică.
As a coach, I greatly wanted to confirm the results achieved in March of this year, and this confirmation is needed for both us and sportsmen, as regards their future developments.
The fact that we have managed to make Romania hear twice this year at the German Open and return home with four medals makes us very happy and gives us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to the highest level.
"All of these would be feasible only with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andrea Ramona Manolache, a coach for children from the Dance Energy Club.
Romania has been represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, it receives a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country as 4 of the 20 participating countries.
Noted that from the new medals, four came to Iashi.
6 methods to escape stress in a minute
Too few of us allow us to run a weekend up the mountain to escape stress.
Some of us have time, others have finances, and others both.
So there are solutions to anyone who wants to escape some stress.
These do not involve any high costs and no special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
The day-to-day strikes are inevitable, but it depends on us how we make them the girl and what attitude we take the girl from them.
Instead of sitting inside and feeling an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the next tactics of relaxation that won't steal you more than a minute.
Deep breath
Respiratory exercises are not intended only for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for every person in part, and the regulation of breathing in a tense moment helps to release endorphins in the body, a process leading to a state of relaxation, reports Livestrong.
Children's Picture Search
We know we've been over the age of copying and we don't allow ourselves to be discouraged when we have a boss.
But that doesn't mean we can't go into a corner of the office office or anywhere we know that we're alone (even behind the building) and don't type as much as we've got our flats.
You can escape the nerves and the negative energy accumulated over a day with some healthy birds.
Imagine a nice place
We know that the recommendation is worthy of a replica during a psychotherapy session, but I don't give a damn about psychology often.
The imagination of a beautiful place, which inspires us to calm down and capture daily braking, may lead to attenuating the state of the nerves.
It is, in fact, self-suggestion, a process that can even change lives, both good and bad.
Everything depends on what we're suggesting.
It's best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Throw your castles into your ears and listen to the relaxing music.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal, you might get heavy in it to relax.
Listen even to the songs of relaxation, which are lines and do not contain verses, to rebalance when your fit is lit.
Decorate the orange
Does it sound strange the advice of a nerve orange?
Well, it's not!
Because it's not about fruit in itself, because it doesn't contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (on occasion, too total).
It's about aroma therapy!
The smell of orange coji during decoying stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, a hormone of good condition.
Mangae and animals
Those who have animals nearby, whether it's about the one at home or it's about the one who's settled next to the job, take a few seconds to eat it.
According to the U.S. National Infectious Disease Center, animal chewing can decrease blood pressure.
watch and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with instruments such as rivals, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous plays from the Roman folklore combining life with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Christian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violet Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and since that time we have had a great deal of pleasure singing together, having a practically unlimited repertoire."
We thought that was the moment when a soul met with a guitar.
Christi: "From the first meeting we realized that what we were singing is very good and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learnt from the other repertoire and, what is very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a mess between people of classical music and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And in the second round we were still stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make only those who listen to classical music to listen and rock, and those who listen only rock to get to like classical music.
And we were surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems amazing to us."
The students in Iaşi stayed more in traffic than they did at school on the first day of the holiday
Hundreds of exits were "captive" yesterday in the infernal traffic in several areas.
The Prime Minister announced that today the Mangeron Boulevard (splai Bahlui male left), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș, is closing.
The Chiefs of the Prime Minister did not comply with their promises to carry out work for the smoothing of traffic at the beginning of the school year.
One of the assurances given by the municipality, at least twice in the last few weeks, has seen the reintroduction of the rotation from the International Cup area.
Although only a few items had to be mounted, and the last deadline for the work was the end of last week, yesterday the rotation was not realized.
The driver's nerves have been reached maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another Prime Minister's promise has been breached: moving the customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis "the late end of August", in the context of which this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica says the problem of the International Race is more complicated.
The rotation will be made at the right time, we need to take account of the traffic of the trams in the area, we need an opinion and from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tramp to stay in rotation, but we'll sort it out in a way," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to this, would be to stop the tram with a semafort before rotation.
The problems in circulation were also in the intersection of Podu Roş.
The range of cars on the streets of St. Lazarus stretched to the SRI headquarters.
"I've waited a good minute to go out to Podu Roș," said one output.
By Podu Roș in September, it was necessary to circle tramways towards the CUG if the project of rehabilitation "Development and rehabilitation of the South functional artery" was completed during the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original one.
"I drew European funds for new works, for example over-extension, on the original version of the Nicolaine Passion was narrow," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for reintroducing traffic in trams is October.
During yesterday's day, the exits reported traffic problems in areas such as Păcurari, Centre (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Database 3.
Admission could return as head of the CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow if the President of the Jewish Council is suspended and judicial control and prohibitions are maintained.
The judges of the Iaşi Tribunal have issued a new term in the "Album" file yesterday, in which he is also the President-in-Office of the Jewish Council.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the magistrates decided to vote in the course of tomorrow on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against Admonition.
It wants to reside or withdraw this measure, which keeps it away from the head of the CJ for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is maintained by the superior court, Christian Adonomy will be able to resume its CJ presidency.
Admission was sent to the Court of Justice by the National Antico Breakdown Directorate (DNA), being accused of favouring the manufacturer and false intellectuals after, I say for the curators, he would have tried to mask an audit control which revealed a number of irregularities regarding the receipt of a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co.
The addendum would have tried to hide the fact that the institution that led it would not have received more material to promote the Iaşi trial, although I am writing these materials were shown to be received by the CJ.
Apart from it, there were still two judges and three CJ directors, but also the company administrator Laser Co.
There are still 3,500 votes expected until 25 September
The primacy is ready to distribute other questions if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The exits have only ten days to express their opinion on the replanting of the Great Stephen.
According to the municipal officials, up to now about 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at city centres and other three additional points (Copou Park, Planada Alexandru del Bon e Primariae).
A record number of outputs was presented on Sunday in front of the Prime Minister.
According to the representatives of the civilian group "Iaşul loves tevi", 530 exits voted in 140 minutes, respectively almost four votes expressed every minute.
Instead, over the course of the month, about 440 came out in the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many outlaws call for signs and the new population to suffer from inefficient public consultation.
Therefore, they called on Internet users yesterday to print a group-available information desk and to hide it on the block stairs.
Volunteers also showed that at the extra point in Copou Park the last formulas were completed by Sunday's exits.
We'll offer a form from the city center, where it's not too complete.
"Any additions will be made when all 12,000 forms will be completed," the municipality spokesman Sebastian Burga said yesterday.
"Non-Secret" will end on September 25th, and if the majority vote of the outputs is in favour of replanting the trees then the Prime Minister will plant your silver in this autumn.
The exits can express their opinion at the district centres of Dacia, Frumosaa, Tatearasi, Nicolana and Păcurari, as well as in the additional points mentioned above.
The Chiefs of the Prime Minister decided to cut their Stéphan the Great in early 2013, an action that attracted an amendment of 60,000 lei to the municipality.
The decision was taken unilaterally, without consulting the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civilian group "Iaşul loves them", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civilian group for their replanting was signed by more than 9,100 supporters until last night.
RECORD of students registered at USAMV Iaşi!
I'm 920 in year I
This year the university has 920 students in year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" stated that this year were the most admitted candidates ever, in the history of the higher education institution, since its establishment.
We are very grateful for the results this year from admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in university history, almost 920 students in the year I. We never exceeded such a number.
"We also had senior candidates, we occupied the places from the budget to the license and master," said Prof. Ioan Tēnu, a tutor in charge of teaching.
It further stated that the university registered a considerable number of tax students, occupying 20% of those places, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results of the study in Romanian have also been published, the English-language study programme from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which has produced 50 seats, with a fee of EUR 5,000, is still being accepted, and the Minister's response to the confirmation of the required student files and study visas is now expected.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were submitted to the 14 budgeted seats and 209 were taken to competition under the "tax" scheme, to the license studies.
Most files were submitted to the Faculty of Agriculture, in number 75, to Horticulture, were 23, and to Zootechnie, 22.
The master filed at the autumn session 18 files on the 150 tax places proposed by the USAMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticulture and six at Zootechnie.
Drivers are afraid to enter the wheels of the cars on the bridge Tudor Vladimirescu
The bridge over the Bahlui by Tudor Vladimirescu remained as curious as when "Journey of Iaşi" wrote about the problems they faced 10 days ago.
Our daily reporters then pointed out that on the axis that delimits the two senses of walking the asphalt left, defending deep pits, some even 20 centimeters, through which concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge are seen.
The asphalt also began to be fixed on one side and on the other side, with signs that the depths would be accentuated.
At that time, interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica specified that the bridge had no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise in order to start a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tram, worth EUR 5 million.
Prime Minister Chirica specified that the area affected by fissures and pits will be signalled to perform quick asphalt recovery work.
The only measures taken so far, however, have been the installation of a crew and a signal band, without even making a simple flood.
During this period, we have focused more on opening school and the necessary work for this purpose.
"There is a point-by-point expertise for the bridge that we expect in about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, I appreciate that within two weeks we could go through to remedy the situation," the interim prime minister said.
At the beginning of school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, as he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if I'm gonna be happy or I'm gonna get hit by melancholy; I'm turning, passive, to the second variant.
First of all, because I have the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him to the gym for the first time, with emotion.
Although it is not easy, no normal parent is happy to raise their children.
Second, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then a story that, in the end, hasn't even ended to this day.
I wasn't even what's usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But I always liked school.
So much, I chose to continue to attend it, even though I was a teacher.
When I decided that this is what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And no one with a table.
That's because, like every one of us, I've given myself over to the whole class of teachers: better or worse, more sympathetic or unbearable, smarter or right-handed.
It happens, unfortunately, that there are people with other calls in this brasla.
I think they're toxic, because they're scaring the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young person willing to form.
I had the luck to give, as long as I was a student or student, over a few, a little, an exception.
These meetings can be crucial if they are to be held at the right time.
Who thinks that the role of the department is the banal transmission of information is atrocious.
That can be done by anyone; to be informed, the student can be very well informed by one, that we are only living in the time of transparency.
A good teacher, however, molds the minds of the students.
He's training them, he's training their thinking.
Staying in the camp is not a privilege, as I think enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mofturous, demanding, unforgiving and always willing to seek the refuges of those in front of them.
That's how age dictates them, temperament.
As a teenager, we all thought we knew everything, that we had certain unscrupulous certainty about anything.
When we're mature, we get to understand that we only have doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to get the teenager out of the category of self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, he's starting to doubt himself, asking questions.
To discover the answers on their own, both them and the provisionals.
To get involved in everything he does.
To direct it in a discreet way to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the time the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who is barely waiting to catch him on the wrong foot to punish him.
But this corrects him, the foolish, the rebellious, to live his life from his old age, to look at the man from the chair with suspicion.
That he just doesn't have a natural way to accept his attempt to order it.
Adolescents are not allowed to be released, they do not accept restrictions.
Or, if I give the impression that I do, she's getting revenge.
And, unfortunately, when there is a rigid person at the camp, who is forced by hardness and does not communicate, the students are revenged on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with the great writers because of the lack of tact of the Romanian professor.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a data merge, that mathematics is all that can be more tired of their inappropriate mind.
I always ask students: if you give a teacher that you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him take you away from the literature to which you should be directed.
How did it happen that I became the man?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He has opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the pub since then on his mind.
I've met in high school a university professor who opened my door to his library.
I looked at him as a man in another world: he had walls of the house covered with book-breathing rifles.
I was losing myself in his library and I was dreaming to have one as well.
Now I might have it, but if I hadn't gotten rid of it, I might have decided to make myself a footballer.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or who knows what else.
I don't think such meetings are happening.
I don't believe in gambling.
It is essential that you give over the man who takes your hand and patiently directs you to your own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the professor.
Now, my experience helps me just discuss what it means to teach literature.
Only the literature can't be handed over.
There's no literature teacher, just like there's a math teacher.
How do you fix the infallible concept?
You can, at least, approach him, without claiming to convey petrified truths.
The man in the chair can do as much as he can to guide the reading, that's all.
But above all, it can hold some miraculous meetings, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
It's meetings that can open their minds, that can raise their voices, someone's voice, their eyes out.
Therefore, the professor of literature must first of all be able to make his students understand (if he feels) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great coseur, Al. Paleologist, says one thing that seems paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and was right.
That's why, a good record prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in any open field.
Fortunately, we always have to learn something.
And we, the teachers; or especially the teachers.
Most of the time, it repeats only a great truth from the inertia: not only the disciples have to learn from their masters but also vice versa.
In an ideal way, the teacher should be a master, and the student should be a student.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A little bit of it, it's right.
But the master was the one who lit the candle.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than to endure as many such divisions.

If the FIFA investigation is extended
The US Justice and Switzerland will undergo new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new persons and organisations, as part of an investigation into FIFA corruption, inform the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, on Monday, at a press conference organised in Zurich, that the scope of investigations into world football corruption has been expanded.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will commit additional prosecutions to new individuals and new organisations," Lynch said.
In May, several FIFA senior officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extracted to the United States.
"We have hope that other prosecuted people will get to the US," Lynch added.
The Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, stated that his institution had sequestered several property, including dwellings and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the course of the investigation carried out in collaboration with the US.
"I didn't even get to the end of the first replay," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terrabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
The investigators also entered into a contract for the award of media rights to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major scandal of corruption, after the US justice has brought 14 people to trial, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven forum officials.
Detained persons are researched for bribery and other useful receipts, from the beginning of 1990s and up to now, totaling more than 150 million dollars.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced at the beginning of July that he resigned from the FIFA presidency, after it was real for the fifth time.
Fighting like a movie at the theater
In the Milan Supekombat gal, the exit of Cătălin Moroşanu will fight with the "beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Cătălin Moroşanu, will participate on 2 October in the Supercombat gala of Linear 4 Ciak in Milan, the last before the end of November, in a communication sent to MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as I promised, we'll come back this autumn with a new five-star gala.
If we're still picking a place to do this, a theater, then we promise to fight like in movies.
We're going to have eight Romanian fighters in the event program.
In addition to the games with the already consecrated stars, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Romans Cristi Speccu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"Soon the full programme will be announced," advocate Eduard Irimia said.
Cătélin Moroşanu will fight in the Supercombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination Gale with American James Wilson, known after he participated in the last pyramid in 2012 in the heavy category organized in Japan and numerous awards from bodybuilding conquests.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, it's really a beast, but I'm decomposing him!
I'm still angry that last year I couldn't fight in the end, so now I'm going to avenge him.
"From beast to cat," said Moroşanu.
In 2015, Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers will have the last confrontations in Italy before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, both of them were imposed by KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm glad I'm back in Italy, the atmosphere last year was incredible.
"I'm just expecting to meet the fans from there and promise them a new show," world champion Andrei Stoica said.
Raul Cătinaș will also fight with an opponent to be established in Milan.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her day, but she had to fight in writing
A girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for the longest rule, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to the Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him with her family.
Writing did not go unnoticed, but the girl received a reply from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for her invitation, but she also apologized for not being able to be present on September 27th, so she even hated having fun with family and friends.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talk show shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died of heart.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and of Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both were writers and politicians, and they both stopped at an early age, with a heart.
Adrian Păunescu, 67 years old, Vadim Tudor, 65 years old.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died, on a TV show.
Plin de vervare, Vadim Tudor has ironied Gheorghe Flutur and criticised Elena Udrea, Minister of Tourism since then, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor said, with a smile on his jokes, to Adrian Păunescu: "I envy your posthumous glory, Adrian."
He smiled and said, "It's not too flattering what you told me right now."
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, 14 September 2015 at the age of 65.
Two INCONSENT persons after an ACCIDENT in Dumbrava
An accident took place Monday night around 19:00 in the Dumbrava District of Iaşi District.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen bus.
The cyclist was not observed by the driver.
Fortunately, they're both stable.
As a result of the impact, the parking space and the mirror of the cars were broken.
Two injured persons are unconscious at the time of transmission of this news.
A SMURD team is on its way to provide medical assistance to victims and to transport them to the hospital.
The cops are at the scene.
A Syrian artist turned Super Mario into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a version with refugees of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the harsh situation of his compatriots on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of the Cyprians, the modified video game has centred on the "Refugetal Mario".
The person is trying to get across people traffic and border police, on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and says he made the video game with the Mario refugee after his friends took a dangerous trip to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova Detention Centre, the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at Craiova Prison Centre, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I, and the oldest is 25 years old and is in Class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I have chosen to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Prisoners' Administration to try to draw attention, and in this way, to a few less familiar realities.
The youngest student, at the age of 15, is enrolled in class I, and the oldest is 25 and is enrolled in class XI.
"There are complicated subjects that society is concerned about discussing right now, we are all overwhelmed by our own concerns and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that these over 100 young people from the Kraiova Prison Centre offer," said Minister Robert Cazanciuc on Monday at the opening of the school year festival.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that lack of education, motivated in many cases by lack of material opportunities, may lead to tragedies, specifying that young people in this centre would have had another chance in life if they could follow the fair school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to know what respect for the law and what consequences it might have had.
"The role of the prison system is not to permanently isolate people who have violated the law, to close them behind high walls, but to try to bring them back and prepare them, because when they return to the middle of the community, they have more chance of reintegration," Cazanciuc added.
The Minister pointed out that investment in schools, hospitals, roads, but investment must also be made in the prison system, because, in many cases, conditions of detention are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, every year in the penitentiary system, there are over 2000 graduates of school courses.
Obviously, we won't be able to change overnight what hasn't been done for 25 years, but it's important steps we're taking.
"In all these ways we need and support society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," Cazanciuc said.
The Minister of Justice has succeeded both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the joint effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Highness of the Holy Cross, I would invite all students and teachers to visit the mausoleums of the Soviet Union, Marashti and not only to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be disbanded!
Request of prestigious university students in Iaşi and country
Over 200 researchers, university frameworks, personalities and students from the country signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society calling on the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even de-commission the academic schools in Romania "to allow and promote academic taxation".
Among the signatories to the petition launched on 10 September are also the teaching framework and teachers in Iaşi.
Among the signatory university students of the petition from the academic environment is, for example, Prof. Liviu Antonesei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former Ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miklea, to cultural people who are also academic frameworks such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Law provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus determining the lack of specific sanctions for doctoral schools that flammablely violate the ethical rules of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," the petition stated.
That request specifically requires compliance with the National Education Law, the evaluation of doctoral schools, the suspension of the right to work for any doctoral school where more than two were found, until the assessment and remedying of the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right of operation for any doctoral school in which there are no minimum number of doctoral drivers provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility for IDEI type project grants.
Do you respect less a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an information agent in the Middle East?
"Why is there no other academys in Europe to give doctors organised by secret services, and the top soldiers who give their doctorate to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pipidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, initiator of the petition, originating her from Iasi.
This can be completed by all volunteers on the Company's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by organisation to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "Pentru Iași" party, founded by young managements of political unaffiliated IT, was launched elsewhere in the Copou Park.
The president of the Iaşi Initiative Group gave an interview to the Iaşi Journal
The valley will have a dedicated party exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of unaffiliated political entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched at the end of last week's Party for Iasi organisation that will propose candidates to the 2016 local elections.
Currently, the party core is composed of IT specialists, but formation initiators say that all people in the organization are welcome who want to be involved in modernising the city.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and at the event more than 200 sympathizers participated, almost all being young.
The special invitation to the action was Nikuşor Dan, president of the Bucharest Saved Association.
He was a surprise of the 2012 local elections when, from an independent position, he managed to gather 10% of the votes of the gladiators for the capital's primary function.
"The people I've seen at "Pentru Iaşi" think they're very good at accessing the public administration of Iaş."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has a chance, I think it has a possible more chance in a community smaller than that in Bucharest.
"I'll be with you all the time," Nixor Dan said.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.
I've been away on many short business trips, I've lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt here is my house.
ZDI: Why did you now decide to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache:Now we've come to a certain maturity, we're a group of people who've been getting to know each other for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we have involved ourselves more shyly, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various building or charity actions, and, somehow, things have evolved natural and organic and now it has happened to be the moment that we have reached the decision that we need to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects for the efficiency of local public administration activity!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimal computerization of primary activity so that different departments, institutions and regions can cooperate as best as possible.
But more importantly, they can publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a certain neighborhood, public consultation of the affected people is important.
If we're talking about efficiency, we don't have to forget the transportation in common, we have the worst buses in the country.
You need to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city matters extremely much.
How do you promote the Iaş?
Andrei Postolache:You're on a plane and you're looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and you know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we bring customers to Iaşi.
ZDI: What is the brand of Iaş?
Andrei Postolache: My point of view is that we must be a city of technology in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go into medicine, enter the robotic area, into the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean here at the city's modern brand.
Of course, the Iaş already has a historic brand that must not be changed, that is, cultural city.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: The administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and delivering projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we'll not just stay on Facebook, we're not online.
We don't want to have "volunteers" brought by bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think they're quite people like that.
ZDI: Should the Prime Minister be more concerned about promoting the image of the city at national and international level, or is it necessary for the area of concern to be permanently building?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First of all, you need to solve today's problems, emergency.
Or, if you don't make a known city, if you don't attract money in the city, at a given time you're without money and you won't be able to do it, for example, street.
You have to do both at the same time and you have to have competent people next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the father-in-law, who comes and knocks with his fist in the table and solves everything.
No, no, no.
We're a team.
The principal is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, have a reputation, be clear and be honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, Introspecials established, after seven years, he was director of the international Endava (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) spent in Synygy.
The company that has established it with another IT specialist provides consulting services in management.
Retrieval program for tractor failed
The Director-General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural cars, launched in 2011, also called Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
With regard to the Rabla programme, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it has been proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
That program managed to sell it somewhere in 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to this, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being Romania's largest, and that great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It is a very great competition with those who come out, all world producers have looked at Romania, know these things I told you, and have special policies.
"At all auctions there is a great agglomeration, all producers exhibit, come with all sorts of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who pointed out that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forestry tractors annually.
By the Rabla tractor programme, launched in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, could sell and receive a valuable 17,000 lei ticket.
The red flag has risen
The internal search of the labs seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader becomes its automatic launch peak in future elections.
Raise, therefore, the red-white flag/ Under its traps we will live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn sang in the London Shrine House yesterday.
He's been witnessing many facts and vows/ Let's not change his color now.
Citizens who do not know the melodic line of this informal British and International Left (The Red Flag) may be looking for it online and would not be excluded from a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we get lost.
The author of these series is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and not of those flying them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn succeeds in joining the left yesterday with that tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party base will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think it will happen that way, but it seems to me premature to talk about the great and inevitable election defeat, over five years, of an elected leader.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of an impressive scale.
Not British Labourers invented the voting system directly for the party leader, on the west side.
French socialists have been practicing a more complicated system, based on motions, which allows the expression of all members and supporters; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the nomination of the candidate to the presidency in 2012.
However, the internal polling of the labs seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader becomes its automatic launch peak in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, the personalization of power being more pronounced in the UK than the rest of the Channel.
In addition, participation in the vote was large in all three "circuits": members of their own, trade unions and other organisations affiliated to the party and, finally, the group of supporters (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This latter group provides us with interesting information on the perceptions of left segments of British society, especially those of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to involve themselves more, in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are, as far as I know, sociological surveys that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "outside circle" labyrinth, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we're meeting a lot of similar attitudes to those of the Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), noting that they will cross the traditional left channels.
If we want to identify a term "antistism", it is primarily reflected by rejecting the centralist line, New Labour (for many, only a dissimulated form of multi-hulit thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go to the left enough, that they did not stand firm at Tony Blair's time.
The second reper - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum on Scotland's independence.
If we are abstracting the separatist message and focusing strictly on the aspirations of other political themes, we see that Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments that are favorable to the social state and motivated by the aspirations of equity, suitable for disarmament and the enemies of military involvement over decision-making, but also sensitive to the new themes of left: ecology, gene, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish laborers have thus lost an electorate to which they should at least have a privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn's campaign).
Just like energy exists all over the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his calling of outsiders, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the "aristocrat" Labourer.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the left-wing anti-system in southern peripheral Europe.
The term "antistism" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
Until next week we'll find out more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as opposition leader.
We'll see if some red flag is going to ring in the House of Commons (not for the first time), after the new leader has occupied his seat, first of all the opposition banks.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is first of all unity - and in this regard he has reason to be concerned.
Manipulation trap with or without good science
As I wrote the article, I went through the network to check on the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became in the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in itself make me from the beginning of the circumspect).
I didn't.
In the last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in parallel with two pictures - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean coast and the one, in fact: the two seeing Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, twice as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article "Syrian Fighters Come With the Valley of Refugees" (signed by Viorica Marin in the Truth of 3 September).
Monday evening, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a handle shot by a friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, but a specification. Laith al Saleh is not a jihadist".
Instead, he is fighting against Al Assad, for democracy and that one.
"So you could add the grosolan manipulation in the table!"
I have to admit, I felt naked.
The more I wrote the article, the more I went through the network checking the story of the former fighter and the "syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "Laith Al-Saleh" person (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in itself make me from the beginning circumspect).
Because I had confidence in the truth, in his journalists.
Instead, I didn't have another comment on the pull on Marius Christian's hand than this: "Do I need this if I have faith in the truth?"
After that, I obviously took the money for the story and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of the Syrian story Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest we found in an Associated Press material (Syrian rebel leader Seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader search for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett from 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among the hundreds, thousands of refugees, on a man who was trying to order in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was the Syrian destroyer Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "was used to be in command", since he "led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria".
We also find that at the age of 30, Al Saleh had "a house, a wife and a normal life before he started the struggle that cost more than 250,000 lives and put on the road a third of the population of Syria".
In an interview with Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh tells us that "all people want to leave Syria".
My city is the most dangerous cities in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me to fight everyone.
Beyond the fact that he was kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a meeting and a more sinister - with a man who recognized an enemy Syrian": "Now for two days, I have seen a lunetist from the government forces."
I haven't talked to him, but I'm still very upset.
We find more material that Laith (meaning lion in Arabic) was, indeed, on his way to Holland, where he has a cousin - a senior officer in the Syrian army and then he became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and be able to bring his family and his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an old man with the civil war in Syria, which erupted in March 2011).
After this has been accomplished, Laith Al-Saleh would not have been excluded from a return to Syria to continue fighting for the Syrian Free Army (frequented by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (frequented by the Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated Al-Qaeda.
A madness - whoever wants freedom must fight in Syria not one enemy but three!
We've gone over a Serbian material since August 22, of which I didn't understand much, just that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come along with migrants: THETORISTS ARE KRIJU MIGRANTIMA calls the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/ves, in which they are accompanied by a photo with Al Saleh with beards holding a Syrian flag in their hands and that of a refugee wearing the shirt with "THANK YOU".
On September 7th, then, himself on the BBC website, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of handling photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo fake claims to show an IS figure posing as a refugee - This viral photo claims to be wrong that a fighter of the Islamic State poses in a refugee.
We find that the photo (in fact: photos - the one with Laith with beard and gun and the one with THANK YOU) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have apologized to the user in the meantime.
Just before that, just from his walls, the picture with the two pictures would have been scratched more than 70,000 times, collecting a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse's gone!
In Romania, on September 9th, Carla Dinu from Hotnews took the story with BBC manipulation, but mistranslated the title: "A fake photo became the virus shows an ISIS fighter as a refugee."
Obviously, the photograph is not false, but the interpretation was a false, wrong, short: manipulation.
21-year-old champion
The winner of the Iaş Rally, Simone Tempestini has secured his national title to the Rallys, becoming the youngest winner in the history of the championship
Cotnari Rally 2015 ended with a result of the young pilot Simone Tempestini, Italian with Romanian citizenship, who at the age of 21 won all the new special samples of the most difficult stages of the National Rally Championship.
As a competition leader, Simone has become a stage before the end, a national champion, joining co-pilot Dorin Pulpea on a Ford Fiesta R5.
The junior season became the youngest Romanian rally champion, the previous recordman from 2011, belonging to Valentin Porciștâanu (28 years and nine months).
In the seven stages of the National Dunlop Rally Championship, Simone won 47 special samples, and the performance of Iaşi re-edits the previous Rally of Arad.
In the second place, in Iaşi was the father of Simone, Marco Tempestine (copilot, Anton Avram, all over Fiord Fiesta R5, all over Napoca Raly Academy Cluj, and in the third place was the Hungarian team Gergö Szabo - Karoly Borbely on a Mitubishi Lancer Evo IXO, performance with which he entered the second place in the general ranking.
At Class III, Edwin Keleti won, followed by Manuel Mihalache and Dan Gârtofan, and in category two motorcycles won Adrian Ráspopa.
Other winners were Adrian Dragan (Dacia Cup) and Vlad Cosma (Suzuki Cup).
The exit crew Dan Iamandi - Rázvan Subtírelu abandoned during the specialty of eight.
I've been through a whole range of lives in this period.
"The positive reaction of the Fed pilots and officials makes me hope that we will be a champion for the organisation this year," said Ralian manager Dan Codreanu.
Cotnari Rally was organized by XS Motorsport (manager, Dan Codreanu) in partnership with Cotnari Company, Primaria Municipality Iaşi, International Hotel, Ford Iaşi - ATI Motors Holding, with support from Silvice Iaşi Directorate, Jewish Police Inspectorate, Jewish Inspectorate of Jandari, Emergency Inspectorate, Ambulance Service, Jewish Council and Jewish Prefecture.
