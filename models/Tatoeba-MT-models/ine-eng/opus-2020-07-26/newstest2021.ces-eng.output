Novák helped Trabzonspora to a second place, he also hit Škoda
Defender Filip Novak helped the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspora to the title of the vice-master.
His team won 2:1 at the stake of Kayserispor and held the third Besiktas.
The attacker Milan Škoda gave the tenth branch after the January break from Slavia to Rizespor, who saved himself, even though he was at 1:3 on the stake of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed the excellent productivity of the seventh goal in this league year.
In 63 minutes, the Golman of Kayserispor just fired a shot and the Czech footballer from the corner set the ball on the net.
The household managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute set-up shot victory on his side when he successfully fixed the bridge four on one.
The damage in the introduction of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce was equal to 1:1.
The opposition did not last a long time, but it did not have to hate him, because the results of the rivals left three points above the slope.
The competition unites the Sunday duel of the Master Basaksehir on the Kasimpas Square.
Well hidden in the caves of the desert in the woods of New Bora was not in fact habitable
In the north of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lužický Mountains, near New Bor on the Českolipsk, in the woods that led the Crusades, several sandstones are hidden.
Natural and artificially created.
And we're leaving behind the human hand created.
The place is called Jeskyna near the fortress.
In fact, there was never a farmer here, and the cave served as a hidden, more precisely a hidden chamber on the crop.
The caves are pushed from side to side with a stone guard and accessible by the stairs of the mountains.
But for the last minute, it's practically impossible to see.
She'll tell her to the narrow stairs leading to some kind of rock gallery from where she's just entering the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human settlements, at the time of creation it could be on the upper surface where the forest is today, the field.
"The fact that the object does not have a window or a traditional place of heat shows clearly that there was no founder ever to survive the winter," explains historian Kamil Podroužek of the Philosophical Faculty of Evangelist Purkyna in Ústí nad Laba.
A single-space object has only a stone beam behind it, which is likely to serve to decompose the vessel.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
On the walls of the cave are traces of tools.
The cracking of the writer's tip was for the entire simple and quick focus.
It was enough to use the spices and the writer to slowly break down.
Depending on the length of the trail after the tip and the method of sequencing, it is possible to define the period of formation of the cave.
According to history, it's probably the late 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is sometimes sleep in today’s times.
If you approach the cave of the mountains from one of the forest roads and we take you under the cave of the current stream and the nearby hilly road, you will surely find the road down too.
And the way out of the woods you must still catch the nearby Havrian rocks.
Jokoj Minarík is after a heavy fall in Germany in an artificial sleep
"Philip is in the best hands now.
The Institute is set up in similar cases, and we are fortunately part of the family in Hanover.
This makes it much easier for me to deal with the situation and also to take care of the daughter of Finj," the server quoted Jezdci.cz declaration by Minarík's wife Katji.
"Everyone's doing the maximum, Philip needs time to rehabilitate.
It doesn't make any sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who's ever met a problem of trauma to their heads and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said a woman in her 50s.
For the financial support of the wounded Minarík, he called on Twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascott on Saturday, matching the legend of Lester Piggott.
On the Gofundme server, nearly 70 thousand euros have been selected to date.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million kroner).
Video spender took the football players Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
The Sassuola footballers, though in the Saturday match in Naples, got four times a ball in the race, but finally they had to deal with defeat 0:2.
Not one of their goals decides after consultation with the video because of the ossier.
According to the Italian media, it's a record of a lack of technology, so many attacks have never faded from one team yet.
"VAR was harder on Sassuolo than a road radar and punished him as no team yet.
New technology markets records," the newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a comment.
"The festival of unknown goals of Sassuol.
VAR has never been so hard on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoleon took the lead on Saturday at 8 minutes, after half an hour of the game, but it seemed Sassuolo had settled.
The goal of Philip Djuricic was not recognized after the influence of the videotape for the ossyd.
For the same reason, they didn't pay for another Djuric's raids and beatings of Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi for the same reason.
On the contrary, another goal was added.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In Czech, they won the most in history
"The growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent public stations, as well as the rapid development of the registration of new e-autos," said Chez Tomáš Chmelík, head of clean technology service.
Other major players such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla electric car manufacturer, but also Bill and Lidl supermarkets, are also reported on on the market.
Operators of classical pump stations are represented by the company MOL.
She doesn't have any numbers yet.
"Our power grid has started to build only a few years," Jan Juskova, a speech firm, explained.
The editor, however, exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stations operated by CEZ.
It follows from these that the drivers from the station received on average 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the arrival of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we remember a small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The long majority of the tankers then went free of charge.
If the motorists had already paid for the pickup, their typical loss was about 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly in the main city.
In the territory of Prague there are all five of the most expensive acquisitions of CEZ, which protect its popular city and the entire countryside.
Then between the regions, Olomouc knows.
On the other hand, the smallest interest is the remote station in the border, for example in Bohumina or in the Prachatics, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars arrived.
In a comprehensive survey of "Cheese in Movement", eight percent of readers said that they considered purchasing electric cars in the family.
Only a third of the respondents, however, know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmentalists protested
According to the organizers, the government's current steps in the protection and healing of the Czech landscape and in addressing the climate crisis are insufficient, speakers called for a more flexible approach.
The actions called the Last Drop were attended by representatives of major organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or Green Party, as well as smaller local companies.
"We have here, for example, people who are going out for a long time against the expansion at the bottom of the Tours, here are people who are going out against the pursuit of scrapie at the Uherska Ostrog, here are people who are going out against the construction of foolish fences," said the organizers of Marik Wolf.
It stated that the main requirements for protesting are the establishment of a plan for the retention of water in the region, the rapid change in agricultural policy and the system of support for sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
"The government is going to raise people's interests, not inadvertent and destructive business," she said.
In Malostranské there was a station with a petition calling for a Czech State representative to be established to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore Czech soil and landscape.
Present-day people were equipped with transparency with passwords like "End of Rape Deployment" or "Minimum Coal, More Men".
From South Moravia to Prague, Jan Škoda from the company came for water for people who protested against the plan of snorkeling in Hodoninsk.
"He threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that gardens represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to it, the planned stork movement is only about 500 metres from the garden and according to the judgements, it is certain that the water quality will be compromised.
The so-called agro-ecological farmer came from the village of Valec to Karlovarsk Vojtěch Vesely.
He pointed out that small farms are being set aside for yield and profit and are stockpiling the population directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a completely normal manner, while not making such a loss in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died on a plane crash at a house in Germany.
At the fall of an ultralight plane on a western German apartment house, three people died today and two others were injured.
They informed the local rescue components that between the dead there are probably two crew members and one resident at home.
The flight took place at the top of the building in Wesel, North Porony-Westfałsk.

The Hasiches have already managed to get the flames under control.
Representatives of local firefighters Robert Mayboom reported that they were apparently killed by both flight crews.
According to the police, the third victim is a woman who lived in a house.
Daník Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) with a reference to Wesel’s old age wrote that it was the mother of a self-animal, whose two-year-old daughter was saved from the apartment with slight injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency crash was found, which served as a brake during landing.
The police come from coming from a hijacked plane.
There was room for two people at the airport.
The machine started off at the airport in Marl.
The newspaper Rheinische Post, with a call for visible witnesses, stated that the plane was hit by a hot air balloon before the launch.
This information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the plane crashed in the air before the crash on the ground.
The Czech friar on Saturday miscalculated some payments twice.
Error has already been removed.
On Saturday afternoon, the Czech spree miscalculated some payments twice.
According to the speech bank of Lukas Cropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The problems with double counting of card payments were not easy to record on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday (Saturday) we did the system update and all these double payments returned immediately to customers.
At this point, everything works without problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients that the bank took out money from bank payments twice, the speaker bank does not know, according to its estimate, was lower than a thousand transactions.
The cause of the problems is verifiable.
"It could be a combination of several factors," said the Cropik.
The Czech sporadic is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, she had 4.6 million of them.
The owner is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is the key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, soldiers will present a three-stage emergency system against coronavir
"They will always be based on the force of community expansion at regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch said in CT.
It will be called semafor, the individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red, depending on the risk of coronavir.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual countries.
He admitted that only Moravskoslej region would have orange color at the moment and would be close to Prague.
There will also be individual measures on the map for regional health centres, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Water and Karolinka
When a waterman Jonah and a miller's daughter, Caroline, look at them, they don't have that simple.
Jonah’s love for the protection of his father, the miserable watertight Hastrbuch, the Karolinka has no idea that her dear Jonah is not a man.
Even so, there's a young Libor who's gonna do everything to protect the entire universe, especially Caroline, from this waterfall.
What about intrigue and lies?
Especially if he can get Caroline Jonas to reject and give him a favor to the fortunate Libor.
Suddenly, it is clear to everyone who can drown the sour Conviction, damaged the flour, the fire of the mill and other lotteries.
The villages are organized into a watershed, and an unscrupulous watering curse will come upon Jonah’s head.
And now Convička's aunt Caroline's advice!

Most of the disease is mild, only three percent of those infected must be hospitalized.
Whether the Czech Republic is expanding the smaller form of coronavir, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved immunity.
The Infectious Division of Patients is semi-empty, even if the numbers are infected with growth.
"This situation today and in April is quite different and it is given primarily to the number of hospitalized," confirmed the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth noting that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic hit us, all the Russians carried out the elections, the Republic was closed, and the Czechs used disinfection for the year ahead.
Ten people died a day, though.
Now the number of people infected is higher daily, but every day with covid-19, two people die at most.
The highest number of people affected by the population still has Karvinsko, similar numbers have already been reported by Jihlava due to a fire in the local Alzheimer's centre, where 57 are already infected - 40 customers and 17 employees.
Another home for the seniors was closed by the hygienics in Montenegro in the Královéhradeck.
I can't believe they confirmed the tests at one of the nurses.
"We're searching, we've restricted the movement, we've got all the hygienic measures," said the homeowner Martin Schaněl.
According to him, none of the clients at home have symptoms of illness yet.
General tests will begin with hygiene tomorrow and then decide on another measure.
The increased number of infected is also reported in hospitals.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which knows if people have a pregnant rabbit at the entrance.
The record reports Yugoslav hygienics who recorded fifty-five coronavir cases - most of them are foreign employees of the labor company.
Overall, there were 131 infected people on Saturday - half the Friday number - but less is being tested on the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh dopsal dopsal mejad, Andersona smetl
The big surprise tournament on behalf of Dimitri van den Bergh also performed an excellent performance in the fight with the player, who won the second most prestigious company in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was bilaterally balanced, the evil came to be 8.7 for the Belgian sniper.
Van den Bergh has taken a 13-chip leg ring and since then has been on top of it.
His opponent literally shook his game and much more experienced "Flying Scott" was only hard to get to the doubles.
The way she was "the Creator of dreams" in her womb also testifies to the fact that the angry Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian managed very high checkouts.
Last time he lost his eleventh leg, but "he caught a big fish" and shut down 170.
At the end of the game, there was a huge frustration on Anderson.
He was more than just throwing his fists into his triumph, and his rival was acting perfectly sovereignly.
Van den Berg changed immediately the first of the three match gifts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The winning of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian plumber than it is to be his first winner.
Still so paid that the last player who managed to defeat van den Bergha is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes there was a charge for the fire of the cathedral, a man confessed.
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began burning last Saturday, and the fire seriously damaged the original windows of the 16th century and destroyed the guards.
The investigators ’ suspicion of the fire was examined because the fire had been carried out by a temple of three different places.
At the same time, the police at the entrances found no sign of anyone being raped in the cathedral.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 29-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then she missed him without starting a criminal investigation.
The prosecutor now informed that on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced charges of fire.
If he's found guilty, he'll be threatened by a ten-year prison sentence and a high sentence.
According to his lawyer, a man is sorry for the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: We present "semafor" on Monday for epidemiological measures
The new system is to play the role of the Pandemic Plan, for which the absence of government and the Ministry of Health is critical.
"They will always be based on the force of community expansion," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravskoslej region or Prague would reach a medium, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional because the situation in each country varies considerably.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS).
A specific measure, according to the Minister, will be imposed on each stage, whether it concerns the obligation to carry chickens or the organisation of special wards in hospitals.
Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the establishment of an epidemiological plan on the TV series, which would allow people to have clear information on what measures they could expect if the epidemiological situation worsened.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
The soldiers commented that there is nothing fundamental about declaring an extraordinary state or revoking a crisis staff.
The government, given the increasing number of people infected since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, has again imposed an obligation to wear gloves in internal actions of over 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited to 500 people, now making 1,000 people.
The government's process, when it was not clear until the last moment, what measures and when they start paying, and when they're not even announced, has come up with criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create the opposite sense of security and the confusion to balance the opposite," said Senator Marek Hilsher in Question Time.
The measures can now vary according to the region, for example, in Prague from Sunday, the obligation to carry chickens even in non-resident medical facilities, for example in doctors or in doctor’s waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear gloves during visits to health and social facilities or doctors was also introduced from Friday in Liberia and Austria.
At the University of Jihlava it is necessary to wear gloves in indoor public spaces, in MDDs and in medical facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, in the Moravskosleske region, anti-epedemic measures were released, as in the Centralised region of Kutnohorsk.
The Czech Government has also approved a so-called ‘semafort’ for Europe at the beginning of June, which colorises the level of the risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly amends the rules applicable to entry into Czech Republic from those countries.
In countries with low and medium risk, the authorities do not require a negative test on or instead of a quarantine test for the Czech citizens from 15 June.
They are obliged to return the Czechs from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category of diseases.

The police have also solved 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technical party, the police carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests on the presence of ungulate and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't been reduced, the police would have been there.
In the TV series Prima Party, the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said that.
However, the number of participants decreased by 1,000, the police assessed that the intervention was not necessary, nor did they ask for a health care station or the Ministry of Health.
On Sunday, the Czech TV (CT) stated that the technoparties had also expanded to surrounding lands whose owners did not agree with the use of the technoparties.
It is possible that owners of surrounding lands will claim compensation for damage.
At Hlaváčkovy Lhoty's hole, guests arrived on Friday night.
The police were looking at a hole in Blaži in Beneškovsk on Friday, where the technoparty took place last year.
It is about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčkova Lhoty, where technicians have finally moved.
According to Nova Scotia, no one came to Blaži.
The snake bite: The girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in the Iron Curtain.
The snake stuck a girl there, the year 2010 that parents brought themselves to the home of the rescue service," said Danika, the country's spokesman for the medical rescue service Mária Svobodová, after which the child was transferred to the hospital in Klatoveh.
The snake is the only edible snake in the Czech Republic, and just in Schumave, these animals exist in a higher number, so it is good to be careful in walking.
No major danger, however, is not threatened by these animals.
The chance that the snake will bite you, it's not too high, they're afraid when they're in regular contact.
And if there's room for this, he likes to slip away for loud drying.
It will only attack if you feel very threatened - for example when you miss it.
Not even her humiliation is a tragedy, but her poison is very effective against the little sages, but people don't die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened body or suffers from allergies.
So the risk of danger is especially for children, seniors and allergies.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in weakened individuals, and in particular allergies can get to anaphylactic shock," said Daník Miriam Gredová from Klatov Hospital.

Sapa Store: Razi revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area carried 1320 pieces of crustaceans of unknown origin, in addition under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the slaughterhouse," the State Veterinary Administration said.
During the control of the living fish stand, it was found that the seller has no evidence of origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, last year in the autumn, the veterinarians discovered illegal food sales, with almost half a tonne of unmarked food without evidence of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption was not found, some of the products were long-lasting and were damaged.
At five kilograms of sepia, the date of durability was exceeded by three years.
Last May, vets with policemen in the market area of 80 kilograms of food without evidence of origin, including dried fish, oil or frozen ducks, part of which was dance.
Putin called Green before starting directly in Donbasa, Kreml criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he was supposed to start paying new charges from midnight.
Putin, according to Kremlin's statement, criticised, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kyev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detainees.
In the new peace of arms, the Ukrainian and Russian negotiators agreed on Wednesday evening to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The measure should begin after midnight at midnight on Monday, be "full and general" and be open the way for the further provisions of the peace agreements to be fulfilled.
Putin told the Greens in the debate that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to organise local elections is opposed to the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens prospects for the settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the upcoming elections to the local authorities would not be held in the territory of the Peruvian rebels.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kyev will regain control of Ukraine's occupied separatists with Russia after providing these regions with broad autonomy and organise local elections here.
According to the Union Agency, the Green Office stated that both citizens agreed to the benefits of the upcoming route in Donbasa and that further measures were necessary to support peace in this region, such as the abolition of the fighting areas or the landing of part of the units from the front.
Putina also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement has helped to stop fighting, however, in occasional shootings and gunshot attacks on both sides of the front, people continue to die.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West blame Russia for the military support of the separatists, which Moscow rejects.
Since the end of the war in Donbas, Greensky has made his priority, but it has not yet come to a more fundamental crisis in the negotiations.
The unexpected master in the decade is Rykl, the seventh ruler of Novotná
The winner of the last two titles, Mr. Dožal, did not conclude the Saturday programme for the fourth year, and Koppecky did not jump the base on Sunday.
For a long time, however, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who has been preparing for the Joseph Karas watch group, resigned after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside MRC, this time he was the only ten soldiers who got across the seven-month border.
Other medals followed by William Straský and Petr Urbanek.
He recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helceleta and Jiří Sykory after the competition.
"It's a shame that there weren't guys here and Kope didn't set up, because those results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I gave myself a person about 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still happy with the stick and I was disappointed with the disk, and I was in the middle there," he admitted on the federal facebook.
On the first day of the seventh, she won with more than a hundred weight of Katerina Cach, although she suffered a wounded leg injury.
In the remote sector, however, it then wrote only 570 cm, did not pass 40 meters and did not enter the final eight.
The novel collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Catherine Dvořákov.
She's out far above all, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it were around 630.
Yesterday I started to pull the trigger, but I'm so glad I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't even limit me," Novotná said on the federal facebook.
Češka has reached bio LPG, promises ecological operation
Crude oil gas, a short LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its essentially lower price against petrol or oil, given significantly lower consumption taxes, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and oil, it also has its ecologically safe option - "bio LPG".
However, it is all news - the presentation first appeared on the European market and, according to the Czech LPG press report, the Czech Association of LPG arrived several days ago.
"In these days we received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG that will be distributed in combination with classical fossil LPG at our pumping station," says Jiří Karlík's association from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biopetroleum.
According to the association, the chemical site is consistent with the classic oil LPG, which in its cars is now tanking a number of motorists.
That's why it's also possible to mix both versions at any rate.
"The only difference against classical LPG is the way to produce it," says Bio LPG Ivan Indraček, president of the Association.
This is also said to be one of the major advantages of the LPG against other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from residues of food and sugar beet.
In the future it should also be produced with a target, e.g. from cellulose biomass, that is, from wood waste.
On the other hand, classical oil LPG is partially produced as a by-product in oil refining, partly separated in the extraction of natural gas.
The result is, therefore, based on the production technology and the source of the operation of the car to the bio LPG of 40-70% ecologically cleaner from the point of view of the carbon footprint than the operation to the oil LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
But it's not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, it's about the fuel production ecology, that is, the "well-to-tank" part (Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of bio LPG currently belongs to petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan for Pure Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol examines the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the Czech Association's estimates, about 170 thousand LPG vehicles are driving; the Ministry of the Environment reports in the NAP ČM a slightly higher number, about 200 thousand.
According to the transport ministry statistics, nearly 6 thousand car stops were carried out on the LPG drive only last year.
In the Czech Republic, it is possible to tank LPG at approximately 950 different stations of operators.
The troops reviewed the number of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for the United Nations) ordered the Ministry to review the number of coronavir infected.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
Sunday's number dropped from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is less infected by 1775.
At the present time, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"After a jump in the number of people being treated, a revision of data that has not been able to update the hygiene in recent years," said the chief of health statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were ordered to coronavir, 11,419 were cured and 371 were unfortunately suffering from Covid-19 diseases.
Mobile polling units or corresponding choice.
Politologist and sociologist sought options for the period of pandemic
In order to allow people in quarantine to vote in the October and September elections for coronavir, according to the Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáčka (CSSD), a change of law is needed.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in a rapid regime.
He introduced it on Sunday at Prima's TV party.
He wants to speak to the Ministry on Tuesday about possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change of election law," Hamaček said.
The Senate called on the government to find solutions under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that there would be a need to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health status.
The prohibition of choice should be maintained, for example, for patients with open-label tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop, in the series of OVMs, stated that the possibility of a corresponding election has been postponed since 2004.
And the current bill, which is in the locker room, then counts with its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, the poll considers the concerns of the UN or the ČSSD (because it would, according to experience from abroad, rather record other types of parties) of the corresponding choice as overestimated.
It is then against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that it is now necessary to develop ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be achieved by this year and at least at the health risk.
The main point is to be prepared for the year 2021 when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The corresponding choice (whether in foreign or Czech) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As yet, they see the above-mentioned electoral units or the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn how similar situations - the elections at the time of the coronavir - were resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Because of the spread of coronavir infections, various types of elections have been postponed in 67 countries of the world this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: The pig's ears threw demonstrators at the government building
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet were attacking the building of the pig's government.
It was another of a series of protests against the "mafian style of governance", which has been playing in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a state-wide blockade, the DPA agency has set up.
Today's protest, which has taken place since 18th day, has, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom, had worse participation than previously.
At 8:00, about 300 people met, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators in front of the building government held a theatre scene, which symbolically included Prime Minister Boris and Attorney General Ivan Gesche in connection with the arrest of two advisors of President Rumen Radeva, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
The two resignations are part of the basic requirements of the protestants.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption during construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of protests, Nikolaj Hadzigenov today, in a public declaration, stated that on Wednesday there is going to be a "top-top escalation" in the form of "global demonstrations in Sofia and blockades throughout the country".
He reiterated the demand for Boris' resignation and his government, as well as for the writing of the early elections.
The proper ones should be made in March 2021.
Boris's already told me he wasn't going to resign.
He also justified the need to carry out the Bulgarian pandemic of covid-19 and resulting from the economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he exchanged five members of his government team, though the protestant's resignation had not calmed down.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government stopped voting on trust in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlović doesn't want any more games without spectators
Football coach Boloni Siniš Mihajlović already has enough Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian visitor hopes that since the new season the fans will return to the stadium.
"What we're currently operating here is not football.
I've got my teeth full of no spectators.
It's free football, it doesn't give me any emotion, no joy.
Those matches are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible, and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that," Mihajlovic said before today's fight against Lecce.
After the coronavir break, the series A matches in the fast track, and although they play until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible weather.
Under such conditions, they don't even know what teams are on it.
It's about to end this season.
The action had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September," said a visitor who in the past led Fiorentin or AC Milan.
For Mihajlovice, this season is unusual because he was missing four months on the lawn due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the break-in of the league, and everything else, our team managed to move up to the level.
We want to continue to grow and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We've become the target of a cyberattack of foreign states, hard Iran.
Since the end of June, fires and explosions and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear installations, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranians said that a fire that broke out in Nathan’s underground nuclear operation this month could cause cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
The Iranian Ministry's speech foreign to the journalist Abbas Musáví according to Iranian media said that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic is facing "thousands of cyberattacks" every day.
He added that it's not about a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to reflect.
In recent months, according to the Musávi, several wider cyber attacks have been recorded, followed by an analysis of "certain governments and groups".
However, Reuters did not report any further details about possible hostages.
The Mustache also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent during the summer.
This month, the Iranian State Agency's article discussed that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, could be behind recent incidents.
Not one of these countries has been directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic contacts shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and held 52 American hostages for 444 days.
The long relationship between the two countries was strengthened in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran, which have a serious impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US army killed the Iranian General Kasem Solejmanje and member of the Iraqi militia Abu Mahdí Muhandise.
Iran then fired on January 8th at the base in Iraq, where the American is acting, a lot of rockets.
The United States admitted to retreat that tens of U.S. soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its criminal enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main supporter of the international nuclear agreement with Iran in 2015.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran rejects.
The TPCA car has extended the production delay, now until 25 May
The Colin Car Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) again extended the production margin due to coronavir.
Production lines should be relaunched on Monday, 25 May morning.
The race will accompany dozens of hygienic measures, said the speaker cars Tomáš Paroubek.
The production is due to the pandemic of coronavir since the 18th of March.
The company originally intended to renew it on Monday, 18 May.
The reason why the delay is extended is, according to Paroubka, a closed border and a closed dealership, so no one has to sell the car.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 per cent from the beginning, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavir is a company's key markets, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the production gap in the TPCA is not signed for life in the city.
"At first it was known, it was empty in the city.
But the street is gradually filling, especially since Monday, when it's a lot of fun.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed in their accommodations.
"In those two months we didn't have to solve almost no problem," Kaspar said.
For example, young Bolshevik Skoda Auto, which also interrupted the production due to the coronavir crisis, renewed it on Monday, 27 April, in all three of its production races in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the races works for 100 percent of the capacity.
The restoration of production in Scotland has accompanied more than 80 hygiene measures.
At night from Monday to Tuesday, in Mladé Boleslava and Quasinás the first time the production was restored was the third, i.e. the night shift.
In the TPCA, about 2,500 people are currently working and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employee in Cologne.
Cancer killed a bride shortly after the wedding: Leave a message to the family
More than two years ago, she struggled with the congenital cancer of Gemma Sisson, and once it seemed that cancer had been overcome, the disease came back.
A nine - year - old woman who loved culturalism ended up in a hospital bed where she still had enough to take her life’s love.
Unfortunately, it's not possible.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her social network facebook for the closest.
Gemma Sisson from English Leeds loved culture.
With a friend of Rick Moor, who lived with him for more than 16 years, they traveled through competitions around the world.
Ninety-year-old woman sported and lived healthy, although she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, hoping to heal.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had succeeded in winning cancer, but in August 2019, cancer returned and this time five attacked.
A culturalist and personal coach, according to the British daily Mirror newspaper, underwent a ten-hour operation of the fifth and then again began a drastic treatment.
Of course, everything was empty.
At the beginning of this year, at her 90th birthday, her doctors announced that she had a few months left.
In April, she finally decided to go to the Leeds Hospital, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding with her beloved Ricky.
Marriage took two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, on her social network account, she came across a contribution that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I'm going to have a broken heart to leave my beloved here, I'm so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who was on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social network followers," she wrote, saying that everyone should respect his life and live it fully.
Machines for art sell travel list, amulet from mushrooms and pexeso
In a hundred crowns, a clumsy pocket work is obtained by most starting Czech artists.
Images and other creations create directly for artifacts, so they know that they have to go to 8,5 to 5,5 centimeters.
Every piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always curator text about the artist in the package and then work alone," answered the curator of the Petra Widžová project.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
The buyer can thus be surprised by the artist’s work.
Currently, you may need to become the new owner of the fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Stoplov or miniviews from Teresa Bonavoent, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutkov has prepared a pexeso associated with the Prague Pass.
The cards should be burnt with the home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrova and Juliana Chomová sell a bag of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a pregnant woman and a flashcard, the second series of illustrations from her comics Spiritist.
Payments in health next year will grow by up to five percent.
The higher the rise, according to Vojtěcha, is unrealistic
Payments in health care could increase by up to five per cent in the next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for the UN) in Questions Václav Moravce on Czech TV.
The demands of experts for an increase of up to 15 percent are considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protection aid.
According to him, they now have their resources.
"I think the increase (payments) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to it, it is necessary to reflect the current situation where, since March, it has reached the selection of the insurance pandemic coronavir and the government regulation against its spread.
The insurance receipts went down at the time.
"I'm going to have an increase of 15 percent at this point in real time," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly benefit of a doctor in acute bed care according to the date of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the payment of a sister in state hospitals and the rent of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data from ÚZIS also show that the remains of nurses in hospitals have been stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 kroner in 2019 according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Representatives of the experts have already stated in June that for 2021 they will require a minimum increase of 10 per cent, ideally 15 per cent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be managed by payment tables, and contractual wages in hospitals, cities, countries or private ones.
Therefore, they also require that the payment tables be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, in doctors last year, wages grew faster than wages.
According to the Czech dental chamber Roman Schmucler, experts should consider how they are currently doing.
As a result of the impact of the epidemic, the House recently approved an increase in the state budget's budget for record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to be paid by doctors in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the health care provider’s board does not agree with the flat-rate payment in the following year.
According to him, the remuneration should be determined by the hospitals themselves and the medical facilities themselves and the money should also go to them through the award notice.
The soldiers also stated that the hospitals have many protective aids at the moment.
The President of the Government of State Stock Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have any health assistance in its possession.
He's waiting for the completion of the selection process.
According to Vojtěcha, now suppliers in the world are able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought.
According to him, the State should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The waving smart quarantine could take over the soldiers.
We're ready, they're calling.
"The smart quarantine works, it's something to improve, of course.
We'll discuss this with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly, and it is a question of whether they should not drive it all again," the president of the government said on Sunday in his facebook series, Chow people.
According to it, it does not sufficiently connect IT systems and hygienic stations, which must gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister in Moravskoslesk, where they are one of the current outbreaks.
The defence ministry spokesperson Jan Pejšek told the CTC that there is no information on Sunday's proceedings and that the government should discuss the matter Monday.
The army is ready for this step, according to him.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantiner led the nineteen-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body of the government, which led the former ministers of the mayor of Roman Primula.
The moving project on Sunday was criticised by the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
And he said he could take the army again.
The lack of resources in the project had previously been allowed by the government's agent for IT and digitisation of Vladimir Dzurilla, who is concerned about it.
"The system works, but it's still working.
Twenty years have come about by itself, and without a system, now we're trying to unite within a few months.
It's not funny.
People for the walk, the poor for the walk, adapt these new systems and actually catch the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Prime Minister Macura won't run again, he doesn't want to "get involved in politics"
Current island prime minister Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort "not to be fooled by politics," the server said to Respect.cz.
Macura, at the same time a member of the presidency of the UN Movement, has been the Prime Minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, he received a leading candidate for the movement of the UN in Ostrava of nearly a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in function for only four years.
"I told myself that I would endure one functional period, and with that business experience here, I could turn everything around and put it on my feet," said Respect.
He added that for the second election period, he had to be allowed to talk to a certain degree.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to be a fool in this policy," Macura added, who in the interview marked himself as a heavy introvert that does not match frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been a long period of speculation about the possible end of Macro in the movement of the United Nations.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticised the movement of the UN, for example for connecting to the movement of the SPD or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities of the UN, he supported Zeman's anti-Jiři Drahos election.
From the movement of the UN, which entered in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in motion, that it's not a completely empty fight and that no one's anything to me, I have no immediate motive to end," said Respect.
The 16th-century Macura studied at the High Economic School in Prague.
Before becoming an island prime minister in 2014, Macura acted, inter alia, as director of the manufacturer of Walmark pharmaceutical company.
He also sat in the organs of other companies.
To Brno returns Uber offering transport services
By the end of July, Uber will be returning to Brno, which offers transport services.
This is the result of the amendment of the law, he stated on Thursday in the press release of the Brno Council for Transport Petr Kratochíl (ODS).
Against Uberu in Brno, the taximen protested, pointed out that Uber does not meet conditions such as a taxi or a taxi meter.
However, the amendment of the Act has changed the conditions for the operation of ordinary taxis and alternative ones since July.
In recent weeks, he has completed several discussions with representatives of Uber.
"On their basis, this company decided at the end of July this year to return with its services to Brno.
This step is the result of a change in the law which allows this company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochíl said.
Uber acted in Brno in the past.
Taxirs protested against him because of the non-marking of vehicles as a taxi or a missing taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary measure which prohibited Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported the taxi driver, last year at the end of the year, but Prime Minister Markét Vaňková (ODS) stated that the city would want to take steps to operate Uber in Brno.
According to later judgments, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now he's coming back on the basis of a change of law.
Since July, it has been argued that, alongside classic taxis, the light and the taximeter can be more easily operated by the transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too much buoyant celebration in Brno: the flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
From the fourth floor of the apartment she flew out on Saturday night in Brno's office chair and fell about a meter from the hallway.
He was followed by a walker who called the guards immediately.
Immediately after arriving at that address in the western part of the city, she noticed an open window under which she was still lying in the chair and next to it several drawers and non-slips.
"The hand, which was carried from the room in the fourth step, indicated that a relatively loud celebration is being held inside.
The officers went out to walk to the apartment and asked three young men from sixty to ninety years of explanation," spokespersons Jakub Ghan told them.
Request for withdrawal Rafaje will prove Babish with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss a request on Monday with the coalition Social Democrats for a motion for a revocation of the head of the Antitrust Office (UOHS) Petra Rafaje.
The Rafajes called for a non-profit organization to act against the anti-corruption council of the government and also the Uztec country.
Social Democrats state that the exchange in front of the office is on the ground.
According to information from CZK Rafaj, the Authority of the Government was not invited on Monday.
The second mandate will end in the middle of next year, and it cannot be appointed a third under the law.
His resignation is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call for non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar requirement from Austria.
They're supposed to be outside of Rafa's causes for the past few years.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to make a request by getting acquainted with the materials and the government's views on this.
He also stated that he had not yet dealt with the president, that he had no meeting with him as soon as possible.
According to UOHS, there is no reason why Rafaj was not accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Current.cz wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafaj's meeting with the Heitman Jiří Činkek.
The meetings were related, inter alia, to the decision on competition for a draft controversial new outpatient hospital for eight billion, which Cunek strongly promotes.
The boy admitted to the meeting, according to him, they resolved his "consensual activities".
So does Rafaj.
The representative of the Ústek region called for the withdrawal of Rafaje called for the government at the end of June.
It also asks for the reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of ÚOHS regarding public contracts according to the Heitman for the transport of Jaroslav Kominka is not transparent and has signs of discretion.
Last March, the police raided the Anti-Monopol office for a myth.
This year in June, the server Aktuálno.cz pointed out that Rafaj is using apartments written on the company of an influential backgammon player ČSSD Alexandra Chuby.
The amount of 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid from Rafa's account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition, Rafaj, from 9 July 2009, appointed the President of the former Social Democracy for the second term of office in June 2015.
In a few years' time, Rafay's second six-year term will be fired.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may revoke the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it does not function for more than six months, or seriously violates the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Authority.
In the bookstore in Blanca, the employees were collaborating.
Helps with air conditioning
The new technology will be 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we regularly go to the library in the center of Blanca.
In warm months, however, it was practically impossible to survive.
There was terrible water and bad air.
Wind didn't help.
That's why I like climate change," said one of the Lebanese readers Petr Novotny.
According to the director of the Lukás Dlapa Library, temperatures in the building have often risen to over 30 degrees.
The southern wall of the object is lit and in the sundays it works as a glass.
"The sun also supports much of the day thanks to the curve of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem for the individual department to explore, because overnight it must be closed for safety reasons.
This is how often we have been in the library since the morning to thirty degrees," Dlapa said.
The worst part was the studio and the desk on the third floor.
And at the height of four, the exhibition rooms and the director's office.
The pleasant climate was also in the children’s department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that the librarians at work were collaborating and ended up in a job failure.
The problem was also common in the cultural hall at lectures that visit dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it didn't breathe there," Dlapa noted.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to make air conditioning this year in all the library spaces.
In the end, there will be only three circles of five.
"Because of limited funding, climateisation will only have the most problematic areas.
The studio and the desk on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department on four levels," Jiří Svoboda, from the Lebanese Investment Committee, informed.
He added that in the first phase, workers had installed air technology and adjusted the electrical installation in the autumn.
About 360 thousand crowns.
The city library Blanco has three thousand registered readers.
It's about nine hundred to fifteen years.
The Chicago Opora won the crown virus.
Crawford returns to the game
Not every infected sportsman will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who keep silent about the health of players as a grave and does not disclose anything at all.
As one of the few came out of the Crawford series.
A 15-year-old relative from Montreal was present only on the first train, since he was missing in the assembly.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positively on Covid-19 and that is why I spent the last fourteen days locked in my home," said the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full load again.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I'll do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible," I added.
The experienced golman has won with Chicago two Stanley Cupy, a solid part of the branch site is already the tenth season in a row.
Blackhawks is waiting for the first prep duel with St. Louis, then they'll be in front of Edmonton.
Thousands in Israel protested against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places in the country protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu solves the crisis.
The demonstrations were performed, inter alia, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanyahua because of the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government solves another wave of the kronavir epidemic.
"Babi, go home," wrote one of the demonstrators, according to the AP agency, to his transparency, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the Emperor has lost his clothes," he stood on another.
The Seventy-Year Netanyahu is Israel's first prime minister in the performance of the function.
He is accused of three causes of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
All charges are rejected and marked as a witch hunt.
According to local media, the process may last up to three years, over 300 witnesses are being called.
Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, by a total of 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the plague.
In March, the Israeli government introduced a quarantine measure that helped to reduce the daily growth of infected people.
After the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, but especially after the end of June, the number of infected again began to rise significantly.
Netanyahu's criticism claims that the government has not helped enough, for example, health-care professionals affected by quarantine measures.
The protester also blames the government for issuing conflicting instructions in the fight against coronavir.
The driver broke the tree car and died.
The body had to cut off the fires from the back.
A tragic accident took place around the 23rd hour at Neveklov for a narrow period leading from the Slapska crossing.
The driver must have flew at a low speed down to the woods and broke the car about the tree.
He's gone somewhere.
The body had to fire the fires out of the back, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by the police.
They ordered a drink that would explain whether a man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other conventional substances.

Pietro Filipi breaks down and betting on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability, and it leaves itself with a fundamental change in the strategy.
He's dropping down and he doesn't want to paint one collection after another anymore.
The fact that fashion industry is one of the biggest environmental polluters is not a novelty.
In the ovens and in the cellars, billions of pieces of clothing end each year.
Look at slow fashion, often distorted access to clothing, but over the last few years, it changes relatively quickly.
About half of Peter Filipi’s goods were sold at a full price.
The other half, which was sold by discounts, won't be so easy to buy.
The company does not want to crush one collection at a time and at the end of each season the products are sold at their production price.
In addition, according to the owner of Michala Mitchky, the time of new and old collections and blind follow-up with changing fashion trends is rapidly gone.
"Most retailers are already counting on the purchase of goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a fraud," says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Micka.
In addition, the company wants to support local business.
"Every product is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We focus on the fact that a large part of our collection is made of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothes that are overtime and overseasonal.
Worldwide is a segment of the premium marks of any absences typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," says Micka.
The large graffiti represents the flight of RAF Kurta Taussiga
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our racing pilot fighting in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal liked city management," Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intensive creation, said.
He consumed about 300 litres of color and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplích-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
As a result of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an international camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid concentration camps because of Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) and then completed a pilot training in South Africa and Palestine.
He joined the war operations in early 1945.
After the Samet revolution, he visited Czech and native Teplice several times, who gave him an honest citizenship.
The 60-year-old Kamil Vacek, known by people in the street graphic art industry under the name Camo, has been working in telipic streets for over 20 years.
The graffiti began on the premises that the former Prime Minister Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) had set up for these purposes.
Bouré Hanna reached the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwestern coast of Texas on Saturday afternoon at local time (before midnight SELČ at night).
He hit the Texa island Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and when he moved on to the mainland, he was weakened by a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a major threat to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
He brought with him strong wind and intense rainfall; with local floods, electrical accidents and various material damage were reported by the AP agency, including damaged ships.
The Texas governor Greg Abbott already announced a state of natural disasters on Saturday for 32 periods in Southeast Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The most powerful warning was received from the coastal band between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay, but he had to live in the area about 500 kilometers long before moving over the northeast of Mexico.
"Although Hannah is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising famine, dangerous weather and a single tornado may pose a threat," the American National Hurricane Centre (NHC) warned.
This morning, local time (in the afternoon SELČ) was moving in the US-Mexico border and accompanied by a wind speed of 85 kilometres an hour.
Hannah became the first Hurricane Hurricane this year in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, a wind of up to 145 kilometers an hour was carried out, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers an hour in the process, which was again determined by Hannu of the Hurricane category.
Local authorities called for storms to cross the home and did not forget health measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to those American states that are the most affected by the plague of covid-19.
In view of the current security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, there is a great challenge and possible evacuation.
The screenings were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the tex period, Hidalgo was also adapted to one of the buildings as a layer after evacuation, which had a positive test on the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
The local authorities have called on all evacuated to take pigs and disinfectant gels with them in secret, if possible.
"We don't even have that far behind us.
We expect disastrous floods," quoted AP Chrise Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
Predictions say that in some places it may be possible to pump up to 300 millimeters of precipitation for a few hours, in some cases 500 millimeters, which together with the rising sea level may flood a number of seabeds on the coast.
Land loan to Colonel Lipkovi
President Milos Zeman will lend the general merit to Colonel Paul Lipkovi on Wednesday.
This results from a review of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for lending the value of the Brigadier General is July's approach to the post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance's multinational division northeastern Poland.
July has thus far acted as a representative of the commander of the forces of the Czech army.
Zeman's promotion at the end of June was proposed by the government.
July since the beginning of August, Brigadier General Karl Röhk will be replaced by the Deputy Commander of the multinational division northeastern Poland, who will lead the units of the Alliance's pre-occupational presence in the territory of Poland and Poland.
In March, Greece became the Director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NUKIB).
The government suggested to the president that Lipkov borrow the value of the Brigadier General.
According to the Law on Callers, a higher value may be lent to a soldier for the performance of a function or for the performance of a service task which requires the loan of a higher value.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division is of general importance.
The soldier to whom the value was lent has the same rights and obligations as if he were appointed to that value.
However, he does not have a claim to modify the payment that would correspond to the values given.
The lending of the value takes into account the reason why it was granted to him.
"Col. Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a model for the subjects.
A significant contribution is made to the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners, and to ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence stated in June in a proposal for an increase.
The mid-term increase will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomir Metnar or Chief of General Staff Ales Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for flight
The European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for aircraft travel to help reduce the spread of new coronavir.
It was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
The agreed standards include compliance with the departure or carrying of the cranes in the aircraft and at the airport, but the average seats in the aircraft will not need to remain unobstained.
She reported that agency Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that ministers still have to formally approve it.
The measures agreed include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers for six years, to comply with the recommended derogation from safety checks and landing at the airport.
The aircraft must also provide sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in a number of languages.
The airlines will also be able to sit in the middle seats.
The common rules on which the officials have agreed shall meet at least some of the requirements of the air carriers.
Different standards caused confusion.
The Arctic Spicbers dropped the temperature record, they measured almost 22 degrees there.
"In Longyearbyen, 41-year-old record fell," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute stated on Twitter.
In the afternoon, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, and by 0.4 degrees it won the 1979 record.
The cave of two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spicberka, located about 1,300 km from the north pole.
Spicbers heat faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other Arctic continents - from Alaska to Siberia, the previous report of the Norwegian Climate Study Centre.
According to him, the average temperature in the Spicbergs grew from the 1970s to the fifth century.
By 2100, even ten degrees can be reached if greenhouse gases are not released into the atmosphere.
Temperature growth in the Spicberkás can result in permanent freezing of soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause even greater quantities of lava and soil droughts.
The warming of the climate also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as the ice bears or the tunnels, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Brits who come back from Spain are waiting for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British government has also called for the risk of spreading covid-19 disease to be avoided by all roads to the mainland of Spain, which are not necessary.
The Canary Islands and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but after their return, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules shall enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomat stated in his statement.
"We have always made it clear that in case it is necessary, we will immediately remove certain countries from the safe list," she added.
As the British Letter Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of British people.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British are also concerned that they will be paid sickly if they will have to end up on 14 days in isolation after their return from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne had a ten-day vacation at Lanzarote, they had to leave on Tuesday.
They've been ordered since December.
"We had a whole family, my wife Amanda and the daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I'm working as a mechanic and I don't think my employer will agree that I'll be back after two weeks of vacation in quarantine," quoted the journalist Metro Hunter.
In relation to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
During the last two days, over 900 newly infected people were always there within 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas have already introduced coronavir measures, such as Catalan trying to limit all night life and prevent people from meeting at large.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out the increased risk of diseases in Catalonia, Aragonia, Basque and Madrid.
Model purchase of electricity from Dukovan government
On Monday, the government will discuss the model of purchasing electricity from the planned new nuclear power plant Dukovany.
The proposal for a law is calculated by the fact that, in the case of a purchase price higher than the price of a power plant on the market, the difference will be paid to all consumers by means of tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be different.
The power plant is an unregulated part of the final price of the electricity for the receivers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Industry Minister Karel Havlíček (for the UN) and the CEZ energy company have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save their electricity by building.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term market price outlook of electricity is always non-existent, which has shown developments in the past several times.
The intention has already been criticised by environmental organizations.
"The purchase price can be both under the market price of the power plant and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the insurer - at lower consumption or at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MPO) stated in the material base.
The Havlíček in May stated that it assumes that the wholesale price of electricity will grow and people will earn at Dukovan building.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per family per year, which it considers to be far less than people pay each year in electricity invoices to support so-called supported resources.
Previously, it was estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatthodin (MWh).
The proposed material does not contain any proposal for an amount, should be included until the purchase contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, at which traders are now the most stocked, is currently around 45 euros (approximately 1190 CZK) for MWh.
"In contrast to the purchasing price and market prices of the power plant up to ten euros, it could make an average household allowance with 3,3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-member households, standardly equipped with electrical consumers including electric safe boards and pipes, but which do not use electricity to heat up and heat hot water - not full 100 CZK/year," wrote the MPO government's foundation.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
Pandemie coronavir has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecast of market prices to be a prominent speculative issue," the CTC said previously executive director of the Energy financial group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law is calculated by means of the purchase of MPOs, respectively, by a legal entity owned by the State at a pre-specified price.
The agreement between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated, however, as long as the low carbon production is completed.
The low carbon production design defines as a nuclear power plant connected to the installed power system with a minimum power output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
The Havlíček earlier stated that the new Dukovan block should have a power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthours of electricity annually, corresponding to ten expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into service in 2036.
The model of financing a new Dukovan block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed without charge during the construction process, with a two-percent interest rate for the operation.
The financing model does not agree with the opposition, it also suggests the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The State should share 70 per cent in the building.
The balance should be paid to CEZ, which will also build all possible additional costs.
CEZ Director-General Daniel Beneš said in May CZK that the expected amount for building a block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion kroner).
Agreements between the State and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded materials to support tourism in the media in two billion
Material that the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to lose in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on a holiday in the Czech Republic two billion crowns, the Office of the Board of Directors has withdrawn.
Minister Klara Dostálová (for the UN) server List messages.cz said that the material is still working.
To document in eKlepu (electronic library of the legislative process) he pointed out on Friday the server Zdrovy.cz.
The Ministry of the Plan has justified the decline in road traffic due to coronavir.
During the coronavir crisis, revenue and media loss were recorded.
The proposal called for criticism of the opposition and the representatives of the travel movement.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website of watchstat.cz, MMR was planning to give money to the Czech Travel Agency for advertising on television, advertising, printing, the Internet, billboards or platforms.
The biggest part of the money, and that's 700 million crowns to get TV.
Most of them would get private TVs from Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weeklys would get 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
The broadcasting stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which are private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and platforms or in meters.
The campaign to support travel in the Czech Republic should begin in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still working, certainly not in the form that should be presented," said Dostalová without any further details on the List of Messages server.
The material criticised the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markets of Pekar Adam would profit from the advertising media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this apparent humiliation will take place in the fall in the election of the wound between the eyes," she wrote on Twitter.
It rejects the fact that it is the aid of the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," said Danika N.
According to it, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
Initiatively, saving tourism does not make sense a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in travel, not the rest of the advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, president of the initiative on Sunday.
If those two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, writes the initiative in an open letter to the government.
Life extract, beer boil and death as a grass stalk
He is also the third album titled And death is the stem of the grass of the Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and the publisher of Jaroslav Erika Friče, who also left the year before, on 24 May.
In Frič's discography there is the fifth item, and as in previous titles there is also the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is the only outstanding interpreter.
Fear, the year of 1949, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration passed through its own, personal experiences and also very bold expressions of faith.
However, he was far away on the track, talking or writing about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, unaggressive, totally tolerant.
I'm thinking in this context of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníkova), the masters are missing.
Frič's album offers recordings of author reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied her with great sensitivity, whether it was the violinist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartonů and Vítezzslav Holata.
I help - I love - the words of the island poet Petra Hrušky about the Long-Length poems.
"She poured out of them pride and endless bitterness," writes Hruška, "on the condition of our world threatened by decay.
The world, which is becoming ever more reprehensible in consummation and greed, is increasingly alienated from what his soul was created from the mystery of faith, humility, and human proximity.
They were called upon to tell those who knew that the values for which they were created were of little interest, but who also knew that they could not be disclosed only because of the general lack of interest.
The poems reminded me that a person may have to lose everything precious, but it is not inconceivable how it will happen.
If he sells himself to a general collapse, skepticically resigns, fearfully silences, or remains to the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamaček
The former Prime Minister and President of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The President and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamaček said that today in the Prima Party TV series.
That Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor, the server informed the message list on Friday.cz.
"From time to time we write an essay, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamaček said today.
He added, however, that it is not official and paid cooperation.
According to ČSSD, it does not have the means to pursue similar objectives.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, so there's a lot of people like that," he said.
In the following discussion with the ODS MEP, Jano Montenegro's Minister said that many ODS members are still "uncoverably listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
According to him, it is fine because it is an experienced policy and the former president of the party, which is also the Paroubka case.
The fact that the media are making an affair is a sign of this year's corny season.
Server ListMessages.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamáček's informal consultant.
He also wrote that, in the fourth place, the country's candidate is headed by a certain president of Petr Benda's cell, who is connected to Paroubka and acted as vice president of his LEV 21 party.
Today, Hamaček said that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile ahead, it's a kick in the ass, it's a Swedish challenger.
The 22-year-old American ticker has ambition and potential to be among the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to defeat the younger Duplantise in two years, last year he beat her at the time of the Association of the University of NCAA.
"We had a battle a year ago, then he won, and I was the second, then we passed it.
In both cases it was a very good fight," describes Nilsen, who secured his victory with a score of 5.95 meters.
Although, from that time on, Duplantis has been shooting up a steep slope and is currently located alone in the highest spheres of ink.
In just twenty years he became a world recordman, this February 8th in Torunu he crossed a plane of 6,17 meters, added another centimeter a week later in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters in 18 years when he graduated from high school," recalls his cousin Nilsen for the World Sports web site.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up with a boy in a man, all his potential and talent would be tenfold.
Twenty years is a good age to jump the world record," she thinks.
Whether Nilsen's record of success is more accurate than the one proud of Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
So far, he pointed out his options at the NSAA competitions, which he regularly won, this year in February, he improved his internal personal record at 5.93 m. In August, Loni won a gold medal in the Panamanian games in Lima, and in 2017, he competed for the American championship in the world where he finished 13.
Then the closest lover for him is to taste the diamond league for the first time.
"It is my priority to get to the professional district and run the most in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can definitely take the same action as the Olympics, the world championships or the Panamanian games."
But because of the pandemic, these top festivals are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other tickers time to improve.
But will this be enough to get Duplantise, which can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere silver fight?
"Everyone is trying to achieve it, but I don't think it will be possible as soon as possible," Nilsen thinks.
"The boy's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got all the other miles in his training."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, he'll want to raise it even more.
A woman lost a statue of a disabled son's pension.
The court is waiting for her.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from a state as an invalid income is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
A woman is threatened with rape for up to eight years in prison.
Because of his poor health, the court of the sick man of his right and his mother set up a guardian, who, among other things, was supposed to manage the money.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 to January 2013 used part of her son's income as a means of income for her disabled son and prepared him for 440 thousand crowns," said police spokesman Dana Ladman, who complains that the accused woman was particularly obliged to avoid the interests of the injured.
The woman, as instructed by the court, arranged the account for her son, since her pension was transferred to her own account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of the son in the medical device and the replacement of the necessary medicines, the remaining funds were used for the purchase of vehicles, electricity users and at home," the complainant said.
That he can't use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
She was, however, shocked by helping them pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems from our income to keep away from homewalking.
We've never bought anything super standard.
It was always about the things his son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't know that I was going to commit a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to pay her son back.
North America has been situate for 30,000 years, hard scientists have found tools
The findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools from the armor, including fine sharps that could be used to cook meat, and spicy objects that could be used as caves or cups.
Scientists have found that the oldest instruments come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said the archeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies that were published on this subject in Nature magazine.
The youngest tools are 12 500 years old.
According to experts, the people of Chiquihuite caves, located at a high altitude, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely recognized theory has said that the first representatives of Homo sapiens passed through the fortress bridge from today's Russia to Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique games of digging used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this clovis culture subsequently expanded in much of North America.
However, this model has been achieved in the last decades when several old settlements were discovered, which were between two and three thousand years older.
In the second study published in the journal Nature, 42 different locations across North America have been reported, showing human presence on the continent from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American fortress before it was imagined.
Some could have gotten ships to America at the time.
"It is obvious that people in America have been long before the development of so-called Clovis culture," declared an anthropologist Ruth Gruhn from the University of Canada in the province of Alberta.
So far, the interest in airplanes is filling up an optimistic scenario, hard salesmen.
The prices are also gradually falling
He sells summers in the Czech Republic grow every week.
In contrast, last summer's interest is still almost half, but demand increases by 20 percent every week.
The evolution after the crisis thus, according to the sellers, fills the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of the aircraft are being gradually reduced.
Among the most sought-after destinations are according to sellers, in particular the South European States.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At the Portal Letuska.cz the most sold flights to the Croatian Split.
From other countries, then, is the most sought-after Great Britain, which, of course, always belongs to the most difficult destination.
The average price of flights is also reduced.
At the portal Letuska.cz, approximately half a month, around 6250 kroner, between about 3000 kroner less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, even prices in some European places, such as Spain or Italy, have dropped by about five in the last few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who now buy airplanes with much less precedence than before because they are afraid of further development of the coronary situation.
According to previous Kiwi.com information, the time of purchase of the flight before departure was reduced by approximately ten days.
"It confirms the future trend when people will order flights with a much smaller front, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice-President for Kiwi.com Michal Šindelář.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with sales growth, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic also rises.
At Prague airport there are currently regular lines to more than 60 destinations.
Last summer's season is about half of the destination.
Big finals already tonight!
Follow the spear battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organisation ended up at a large final.
It features an experienced nine-to-four-year-old Scottish skier Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, a six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson took Justin Pip in the first round, then hit his neighbor in the tableboard.
James Wade, however, advised himself, and in the quarter-final, he strongly opposed Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home a world unit.
"Flying Scott" was in trouble in the semifinals when he was facing Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he fled the tomb from the shovel, dominated in the long run, and after the result of 18:16 he fought a place in the final tournament, which he ruled already in 2018 when he defeated Mensura Suljovice 21:19 in a great battle.
The biggest surprise World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent uses the tournament and perhaps knowing that it has nothing to lose helped him to play on a totally fantastic wave.
Seventy years ago, the shooter first struck the world's sixth Nathan Aspinall, pressed Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and won Adriana Levise in a quarter-final.
A big check was semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the start, but then, in a calm Belgian series, he obtained a leap, which then kept to the end almost without problems.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high score, which affected temporary uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavir cases occurred at least from the beginning of the week, decreased the number of tests
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has been reportedly infected by 15,212 people.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already been treated, 368 patients have died.
At present, there are 5 254 people who are sick.
It comes from data on the health ministry's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times two hundred.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, there were positive 235 tested, the day before 246 and Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 were injured.
Out of the cavid-19, 9,590 people have been cured in the Czech Republic, 63% of all those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease had a slight duration.
In the hospital, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir have a condition 19 of them rated doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, estimated at 100,000 residents, is still showing Karvinsko, which is nearly 59.
The following is the period of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected to 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Because of the increased number of infected in Czech Republic since Saturday, new measures against the spread of coronavir are in place.
People have to wear gloves on internal collective actions of over 100 people, it's about cultural and sports events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited from the present thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who are manifestly infected with the new coronavir has already exceeded the 16 million limit.
It has been introduced by the American University of Johnse Hopkins, which is monitoring the development of the pandemic worldwide.
The victims who died from covid-19 diseases are estimated to be 645 thousand, according to this source.
The latest million infected were added to statistics in just three days; the 15 million threshold fell on 22 July.
In recent days, the United States, which has registered more than 4.1 million infected, has the highest rate of rapid growth in cases in Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been ordered by the authorities.
The infected are now at a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that from Thursday to Friday, more than 284 thousand new cases have been reached worldwide, which is the highest daily balance from the beginning of the pandemic.

Health damage to air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only the poor air quality in outdoor spaces but also at home.
She pointed out that the Israeli expert on human health, Carol Abraham, had already quoted The Jerusalem Post.

During long-term exposure to non-healthy substances, internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all of the damage, but it comes from objects within the household, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
