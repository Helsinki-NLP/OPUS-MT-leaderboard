New issues on the California Water Supply Project
Critics and state legislators say that they want to know more about who pays for a $16 billion project worth of Governor Jerry Brown, following the statement of the California Water Supply Administration’s leading representative, that the Brown administration is offering government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government's funding described by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Administration may contradict the state's long-standing claims that various local water supply administrations, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision to extract two equal 35-year-old tunnels to transfer water to the south of the Sacramento River, mainly Central and Southern California.
Initial expenditure on tunnel construction of US$ 248 million, which is still to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already been launched by the Federal Audit Research Centre.
On Wednesday the state legislators also ordered a state audit on the construction of tunnels.
On Thursday, State Speaker Nensija Vogel said that, despite the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Management Account, no money will be used from the state's general budget to complete the current planning phase of the dual tunnels.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the representative of the Assembly, Susan Ega, one of the state legislators of the audit ordered this week, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
"It is a game of shopping stones," said David Wolfs, Legal Director of the Howard Jervis Tax Association.
In my opinion, this is called to the hearing of yesterday's audit (the request): there are a lot more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water supply management and water consumers in Central and South California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide more safe water supply to Californiars.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the state will use tunnels to channel too much water from the Sakramento River and the San Francisco Bay, causing damage to Northern California and further endangering local species.
Metropolis and other water supply administrations intended to receive water from tunnels still have to be committed to paying for their insecurity as to whether the investment of large resources will really provide enough water for it to be repaid.
The same water supply administrations also announced this year that they will not be paid for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project is first authorised by the supervisory authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report published by the Los Angeles Water Supply Administration on the tunnel project mentions that "the Fund has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be granted from state or federal budget."
After all that local water supply administrations have spent on the project, including $63 million from their water supply management, "is expected", that the state will use national money to complete planning," said Bob Muirs, a spokesman for the Los Angeles water supply management.
He continued to ask questions to Vogel, the state speaker.
Vogela said that the state plans to allocate money for the completion of the planning of tunnels from the fee for the existing half-century old water network, the State Water Project.
However, the tunnel construction opponents point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009 which, they say, prevents the state from spending money on the construction of tunnels until the water supply authorities that benefit from it will assume payment obligations for them.
"The project contractors have promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to cover these commitments," said Patrízia Šiferle, environmental consultant and former planned tunnel opponent.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Addressing a business group under the Chinese Cybersecurity Act
The coalition of international business groups has addressed China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will harm the country for trade and isolation.
The letter to the Chinese Prime Minister Li Kecijan has signed 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, expressing global concern that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese security product market.
Among the signatories are the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter dated Wednesday said that this data loss could make it easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianjin: a year since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that the company has earned to know what happened in Tianjin.
Chinese leaders plan silent reminders to mention a large - scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people on the first day of the year, but not all agree.
John Sadvorts reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world would be the time the nation remembers and remembers the anniversary of such a great disaster.
Not China, however.
Although a memorial service for the memory of some dead firefighters is held in the city of Tajin, such reminders are excluded elsewhere.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors as well as family members are warned not to speak with foreign press.
However, 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan does not want to be silent.
"This year's society should know something about what happened," he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On 12 August last year, Zhangs was a radio operator in the military firefighting brigade, which was only a mile away from the explosive epicenter.
"The call was received yesterday at 22.53, and we started sending my team members," he says.
Instead, they could arrive within 10 minutes.
The burning of large fires in the chemical warehouse also rushed teams from other places in the city.
None of them drew attention to the fact that a large quantity of volatile and toxic substances was illegally stored, with a sharper than the permitted quantities and without proper monitoring.
The fire began when nitrocelluloses, which were allowed to be used in nail lacquer, were consumed by the party and then burned in the summer.
It then spread into a huge area - 800 tons of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
There were windows and a fire department, where Zhangs Mengfan was waiting for a radio station news from the scene, to enter the roof.
This information was not received either.
"When I saw the fairy tale, I fell into confusion," he told me.
I knew what it meant to my friends.
Of the 26 fire extinguishers who were sent to the site of the explosion, eight of his units never returned.
Many others have suffered serious burns and other injuries.
Most of the two major explosions were compared to an earthquake, and the blast wave was felt many miles away.
The total loss is estimated at more than US$ 1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
In general, 173 people were killed, 104 of whom were firefighters.
The remains of eight people have not been found.
The authorities of the official government investigation are guilty of corruption, political contacts and official secret agreement, which has allowed circumvention of the rules and ignoring security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse should never have been built close to home.
More than 100 officials and management officials have been involved in some form of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, as long as the government can point to the progress achieved - thousands of homes and compensations for citizens, these sensitive issues remain relevant.
Tragedy has emerged in a complex system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
The courage and sense of duty of the evening is not questionable, but without a fireman as a hero’s image, the scene is not entirely pleasant.
It contains a firefighter as a victim who was sent to fight a man - made disaster without any warning.
Zhang Mengfan no longer works in the fire department, but will visit the memorial service in Tianjin.
He will carry the message of his dead loved ones with him in his heart.
Most of all, I would like to tell them: I have visited your parents and they are doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I will fulfill your duties as a son.
Cold spring could affect the Scottish ruby shooting season
Scotland's rubbing season will start later, as the number of birds has decreased this year because of the cold weather.
Shooting in several properties has been postponed, as many of the new rubies have not survived in cold weather.
Noting the beginning of the season, the Association of Scottish Players (SGA) announced that the shooting of rubella provides more work than the Edinburgh Festival.
However, the OneKind Animal Welfare Fund calls for the end of the "gross killing of birds".
The director of the organisation, Harry Hutton, said: "The work that is invested in providing large numbers of birds for shooting is huge and unrelentingly involved in all the contentious activities."
There is no surprise that the society is avoiding this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban unwanted, unnecessary jobs enjoyed by only a very small part of the people of Scotland.
Landowners both insist that they undertake to keep the number of birds and that the shooting of rubella is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA President Alex Hogs said that the sector provides 8 800 full-time jobs in the less-favoured regions of the year and that it has been a 'rich job drop' in uncertain times.
He said: "In Scotland, compared to many European countries, there has not been so much a culture of hunting, and some people don't even know how the shooting season affects the country's economy."
Hogs said that the number of jobs provided during the shooting exceeded the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, Fringe Festival, Festival of Celebrations and the Old Ages together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is currently quite worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game managers and their families want to see the sector rise.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that those who work hard can rely on these jobs in the future as well.
RSPB Scotland considers that at least eight golden eagles have been killed near the ruby habitat.
Many game managers recognize that rubbing is not generally popular, but SGA claims that the industry has "taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the Ruben shooting season is traditionally known as the "Holy Twelve."
However, there is still much discussion about this type of sport, and the management of rubella shooting sites is related to the persecution of some of the offenders by the nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, the RSPB Scotland said that in less than five years, in the mountains of Monadliata, in the southeastern part of the Invernes, eight golden eagles were missing.
The Natural Welfare Fund considers that they have been illegally killed near the rubble shooting sites and their satellite a process has been destroyed.
Scotland's Environment Minister Rosana Kaningema said that these reports are "very disturbing and distressing."
Ms Kaningema asked officials to analyse evidence of approximately 90 survivors and missing eagles with transmitters to determine whether there was a trend in criminal activities.
The Scottish cleanup group blames the RSPB for attempting to raise anti-fouling feelings before the beginning of the rubbing season, and said that there was no clear evidence that the birds had even been killed in the vicinity of the Monadlit Mountains.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Brionija Pejža Great Britain pours silver in the tramplining
Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Pedža's silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver-silver
Briony Peigga became the first British woman to come to the Olympics medal in tramplining, Rio throwing the silver.
Peiži (25) to the gold ran out of 0.425 points, because Canadian representative Rosana Maklena already won the second Olympic title with a result of 56,465.
The world champion, the representative of China, Lī Dana was at the bronze, while the second British finalist, Katrina Driscola, finished her sixth.
I can't believe I fought the Olympic medal.
I am so happy," said the emotional Paige.
I did not feel that it was a medal, but the ability to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and hard work had been paid back.
I am so happy that I could start at the end with Kata, already the participation of one representative at the end would be historic, but we were there two.
Peiža’s highest achievement in international competitions was the fifth place in the 2015 World Cup in Denmark.
Tramplining in the Olympics was included in 2000 and this is the first time British women have managed to get to the finish.
Reaction to medal.
The British team's representative Nathan Beilis, the only representative of men in the race for the tramplining week, was in ecstasy.
Hanna Velana, who has been involved in the Olympics for the second time, quickly began to celebrate the success of Paige.
Peigga has gained a bachelor's degree in biology with excellence at the University of Shefylda.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans lead gold medal in the regbi-7
12-year-old boy to watch the game, watch half the javelin in the fields of sugarcane to the nearest television
Fiji after its history, the first Olympic gold medals begin to celebrate an unprecedented scale
Banks closed, shoplifted and celebrated Suva streets, singing, singing and dancing
Fiji won a gold medal at the Deodoro Stadium in the 7th row at the end of 43-7 with the collapse of Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island stopped their normal work to watch the historic game.
Fiji's Lead in Its History of the First Olympic Medal
Many fellows wore Fiji’s colors and rhymes, wearing the national flag, and encouraging the team.
When the games were finished, the thrillers went to the streets, humming and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the streets of Suva and joined with Fiji flags, not paying attention to the small bottlenecks they created," says Fiji Times.
Sweets will definitely continue at the end of the week and next week.
Irish Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Arons Makenefs entered two first half-time sentences in Finnpark.
Derry City has risen to the second Prime Minister, winning a convincing victory with the result of a 5-0 fight with Finn Harps.
Arons Makenefs put in charge of the "confection strips" by successfully implementing two first half-time sentences, which were awarded for violations against Lucas Schübert.
Nathan Boil entered the gates at the beginning of the second half, and Šübert’s ability to fight in the fourth quarter before the attacks of the Kitta Varda were delayed, ending the opponent’s funeral in Finnpark.
Derry is one point ahead of Cork City, and both teams will be in the decisive game on Monday evening in Brendwell.
It was Derry's first victory over his North-West competitors in the season, and they disturbed me on the part of the HARPS.
Makenef saved the game in 17 minutes after Kiran Kola left for Sübert, even though the offense turned out to be outside the court.
There was no doubt about the second sentence, the former semi-sguard of the Caramel Strip, leaving Sübert to fall to the ground and Makenef to achieve the result in the third minute after the break.
Boil added the exact point after Dina Jervis's match with the foot within the eighth minute after the game began.
Derry City Guard Gerard Doherti had a peaceful evening, but he managed to protect the gates perfectly, overcoming David Skalli's guests in the best opening of the game.
Sübert snuck a ball long before Colam was pulled out in 83 minutes, and soon Varda’s wisdom was reflected in the protection of the Harp Center, Richard Brass.
It was Derry's biggest competition series and a great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test for mass unorganised tests at the University of Highlands and Islands (UHI) course of the Inverness College
All 20 students could have been expelled from the Inverness College UHI's highest media course.
Most of them were 17 - 18 - year - old students who hoped to use the notes they received in their studies to attend the university.
The Inverness College UHI argues that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) investigates this case.
The SQA press secretary said that the highest media assessment available throughout the country in 2016 was "as planned".
Twenty students enrolled at the offered and evaluated course of the Invernes College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who were learning online, but they often had to go to Inverness Colleges from their homes, such as Locheiber.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications on social media that she had not received any evaluation for her work, at least 10 also reported that she had received no evaluation of her course work.
He told BBC News Scotland directly that about five more people who took this course at Inverness College last year and who managed to contact him said the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glázgova, but she will be able to accept another university offer thanks to the qualifications obtained at school.
However, her father said that there were also others who visited the college's organized media course that had not been carried out and were now in "forgetting" and insecurity about whether their work would be reviewed and evaluated with a view to their admission to universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Uppers and Islands.
Diāna Rovlinson, Head of the Inverness College UHI and Executive Director, said: "Our exam results and student success are very important."
This is also confirmed by the excellent review of the Master's Education Inspectorate (HMIE) received this year, as well as by the improved levels of achievement in both continuing and higher education over the past year.
As we have done every year, we are making an overview of all the results published compared to those predicted by each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were carried out and the assessment body recently reported "significant improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "evaluations were consistent with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
The SQA press secretary said, "We are pleased that 2016's highest media evaluation has taken place as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there has been a slight increase in the A-C performance rate compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers in prison for samurai teeth "inhaled" in Kilmarnok
Jason Braidena was attacked with samurai teeth, Nazis and nuns
Two brothers were imprisoned in prison for killing a man with a samurai tooth after drug-related beatings in Airshira, which was "inhaled".
The victim, Jason Bradens (38), was found several times at his home in Kilmarnok on July 5, 2015.
At the Supreme Court, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after the death penalty.
His brother, John (38), was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less severe charges of murder without prior payment.
By forcing both men to prison, Judge Bill Danlops told the brothers that they had committed "an unforgivable, cruel and vicious attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Braden had slept and waited for them, armed with a samurai tooth.
Judge Danlops added: "You are planning illegal entry together with at least one Nazi and a Nazi."
Jason Bradens may also have been a drug addict, but he was a son, a father, and a friend.
You put her down.
After the two men were imprisoned in prison, the criminal police inspector who conducted the investigation said, "John and James Clark's violent and horrible action has resulted in Jason Bradeen's death."
Go to the world at 38 years of age in such dire circumstances, there is a heart - to - heart situation that needs to be experienced by the family.
The court heard earlier that the brothers in Kilmarnok had decided to seize Mr. Braden’s golden attitude, which they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both alcohol and drug abuse went to his house, masked his face with helmets, and armed with noses and eastern fighting.
It is believed that the tooth used in the skull belongs to the dead.
The neighbors said that they saw Clarke shoot Braden when he sat on the couch at the window and heard his scream.
Prosecutor Richard Godards at the courtroom said, "The assault on this man was sustained, chaotic."
Thereafter, the place of killing was described as "inhaled".
In addition to the injuries from the footholes during the Braiden attack, he suffered a severe trauma with a troll object.
Three days later, he died at Kilmarnoka Kroshaus Hospital.
Both brothers do not confess to murder.
Giving evidence, James Clarks, who had been tried 38 times before, including a murder attempt, said, "I didn't want it. It was an accident."
John Clark, who has been tried 23 times before, said that he was just involved in helping the brother who, according to him, attacked Bradens."
A man is sentenced to imprisonment for the slaughter and extermination of his infant’s son
David Sinclair admitted his guilt in the murder of his child in his home in the Real Kilbraid in 2012.
A man who was whipped and killed by the rage of his childhood children because he did not want to eat will be sentenced to seven years and three months ’ imprisonment.
David Sinclair cut four months old Joshua when he "lost control at the moment" at his home in the Real Kilbraid, South Lancashire, on December 6, 2012.
The cause of death was determined only after a court medical examination.
Sinclair (34) was initially accused of murder, but was found guilty of murder without prior tax.
In the Supreme Court of Glázgova, instigating him to prison, Judge Lord Briesidls Sinclair said: "You attacked your child's son by cutting him, causing the injuries he's dying of."
When you cut her, you had to know that, but you didn't find out.
Only after thorough medical examinations you will know what you have done.
Your wife believed you.
Now his feelings have been transferred and you can no longer be supported.
Lord Briesidls described the consequences of Josh's death as "catastrophic" for everyone and added, "Nothing will return Josh."
The court had previously found that on the day that the child died, Sinclair and his wife, Kersty, had gone to swim with Joshua and to buy a pair of shoes.
At 5:30 p.m., Kersty Sinclair went to meet his mother and sister.
Only 11 minutes later, she was called by Sinclair, who heard "shocked."
He said to her, "Joshua doesn't breathe like he's coming, right away, even coming home."
Then he ended the conversation and called 999.
The infant was immediately taken to Hermira’s hospital, where he died.
The original cause of Joshua’s death was unclear, but they were examined by a team of judicial experts, who found that shortly before the effects of the trauma of death in the eyes and brains, such traumas were not possible by chance.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richards, a neurosurgeon at John Redklip Hospital in Oxford, said: "It has happened because the child has been tortured and thus has suffered injuries, as well as has been assaulted with more force than daily."
The representative of the D.J. told the court that Sinclair was "extremely sorry".
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Holoja Tatone threatens the position of July Jefimovas
To the representative of Britain Tatoni discharges from the hands of bronze in the swim 200 m
The UK representative, Hloja Tatone, criticises the participation of the contrary-rated swimmer, Julia Jefimova, in Rio's games after the Russian representative rushes him 200 m in the swim.
Jefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games following the complaint about the prohibition of participation on the ground of the doll, made a silver coin leaving Tatoni in the fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be completely clean," said 20-year-old sailor.
I haven't already decided who's in there.
I'm not satisfied with it, but that's it.
Jefimova, who fought the second place, learned about his participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see people get out of sports, but I don't think it's really right.
She was not supposed to participate in the competition, and a 20 - year - old British representative had to score a medal.
Rie Kanetto won Japan's seventh gold medal in 2016 in Rio, overcoming Jefimovu, who was at the gold medal.
China's representative Jinlinga This was at the bronze, only six hundred seconds after Tatoni left in the fourth unit.
His British teammate, 20-year-old Molly Rensov, finished at the sixth grade.
"Remaining in the fourth place is a bit of a disappointment, no matter what's ahead of you," Tatone added.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little confused about fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and that would have been a dream.
However, the final meeting itself is an excellent experience I will take with me in the years to come.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long run it will make me strong, and it will make me look more and more for the medal, so I'll probably get closer to it next time.
Tatone was only 0.01 seconds away from British record women at the end of 200 m swimming.
"Each person must give a second chance," - Jefimova.
Jefimova, who said that he had been tired of answering questions about her doping in the past, defended his right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was banned for 16 months after her body had found anabolic steroid traces.
The Sports Disciplinary Court (CAS) stated that athletes cannot be prevented from participating in Rio games because they have already been subject to sanctions.
CAS examined my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and has another opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Each person must be given another opportunity.
When you go out and you get the ticket, no one puts you in jail.
Bens Prauds removed the place for 50 free-style swimming
The British record was previously installed to protect the position of men at the end of 50 m of free-style swimming.
The distance of the Union champion Praud (21) was 21.54 seconds until the fifth fastest qualified Friday final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is harmless and ugly
Indian Sports Minister Vijays Goels Rio Olympiska has been an all-embracing character, often myths in the courts, encouraging Indian athletes and taking the selves after their start.
However, he and his large company have apparently caused the anger of the Olympic game organizers due to their uncontrollable behavior, repeatedly trying to break out to the competition areas without proper accreditation and rude response to the news agency Press Trust of India when being tested.
Vijay Goels, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
Wednesday, the organizers of the Olympic Games threatened to cancel Goel’s accreditation if his behavior did not improve by sending a warning message after he and his company tried to enter restricted access to the restricted access areas at the venue and in the arena where the event is held.
"We have received a number of reports that your sports minister has tried to enter the accredited competition zones with people who have no accreditation," says the Continent Manager of the Sára Peterson, Rio 2016 Organizers Committee.
When the staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the people who were with the minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes went away with our staff.
"If the team of our protocol becomes aware of any other such behaviour, your sports minister's accreditation will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be cancelled," the letter continued.
The head of the Indian delegation referred to this case as a "puzzled zilon", and Goels himself said that he had done nothing wrong by writing it all as a "understanding".
On the tweet he wrote: "As far as I know, we have observed all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
In other words, India has all the fuss of these Olympic games, there are no medals at the moment.
Hopeless fans in the social media pointed out that Michael Felps has won as many medals as India’s history has.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinas Bindra, who fought for a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he left the fourth.
The wind launches money and opportunity," author of the Sardinian script and column author Shoba De.
However, there are still some strange hopes, as there will still be competitions in the box, golf, tennis, light - yellow and, yes, in the fridge.
Dipa Karmakar, India's only winner, will focus on the finals of the season on the weekend, showing his terrible double-turn "Death Lens", the "Prodova" race, which only some other winners have tried.
In a country where 1.25 billion people live, the low number of medals awarded by India has always been a cause for concern.
Analysts say it has countless reasons.
National anger is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a substantial contribution to infrastructure and Olympic training - Karmakar’s first tool of training was made from old-fashioned spare parts.
Parents have always stressed the overriding of academic knowledge about sport.
And sports authorities have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has replaced the Indian Olympic Association for Violations of its Statutes in 2012, as it has elected leaders against whom criminal proceedings have been brought.
In Sochos three Indian winter participants were even prevented from representing their country, wearing a flag or wearing any national symbol.
They meet as independent athletes.
When people get the blame, the turbulence jet-blue plane on the Boston-Sakramento route is forced to drop off in South Dakota.
The JetBlue aeroplane was forced to perform an emergency landing on Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sakramento.
Reiss 429 from Boston to Sacramento left in Rapids, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 p.m. after the local time.
The airline reports that the injured have been transferred to the hospital for inspection.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to help the injured, has banned the spare aircraft to deliver the other passengers to Sacramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) launches a long-term opportunity for medical marijuana
Unfortunately, the answer is: I don't believe it.
This is a loss of opportunity which may lead to even more delay in treatment for countless people.
To date, only one source of medical marijuana has been approved at the federal level at Mississippi University for scientific purposes.
It seems to be a little more positive today that the DEA has also announced that it will now allow other places to apply for the same permit.
There is hope that the level of marijuana available for scientific purposes and diversity could be expanded.
Although this will draw attention to a good study, it will be symbolic to a large extent, as no matter how many marijuanas are available, if access to it is still difficult, it is of little importance.
Imagine a product that is very required but is stored behind closed doors.
Responding to a request for a product which takes a difficult, understandable decision to produce it more, but never shuts the door.
This product is a marijuana and its location in list 1 is this closed door.
Medical marijuana is present in such an unpleasant situation.
Since marijuana is a substance listed in list 1 (respectively, as defined by the definition "not currently approved medical use and there is high potential for unexpected purposes of its use"), there are significant barriers to unlocking doors.
Potential researchers usually focus on DEA because it allows them to start scientific studies.
Even if an authorisation is granted for the examination of substances on list 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and must establish high-level safety systems which may be costly.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of obtaining authorisation from its academic authority to conduct first-order studies of substances included in list 1.
Even if individual college representatives want to conduct this study, university management may not want problems or some potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at Arizona University when Dr. Søu Sisley was released from the post after an effort to advance medical marijuana trials.
Sisley eventually sought private funding for his project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was proposed, her project became the first medical marijuana attempt to prevent posttraumatic stress for the veterans, approved by the DEA.
After years of fighting bureaucratic barriers, the National Institute for Drug Addiction has believed in the key to the last lock.
At present, it is the largest federal researcher in the state of marijuana, and it is the only provider of marijuana itself.
Even if a higher amount of medical medicine is available in free circulation studies, the Institute will still have to approve all its funded studies.
The problem, however, is, in its name, 'disposal'.
San Francisco University representative Dr. Donald Eibrams, who interviewed his documentary film Marihuana, says that the Institute's main task is to study substances in the context of their potential dependence, not as medications.
Ebram pays attention to an important fact.
Even if the study will overcome all the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to investigate the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the damage it has caused.
Note: In a quick (and unscientific) search in the U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1,434 works on medical marijuana have been found in the last five years.
In this same search only 57 works were for the benefit of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the harm done by marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marihuana caused by pancreatitis" and "The use of marijuana and the risk of lung cancer."
Such a disproportion creates a completely distorted view.
The way to medical marijuana is mixed with surprises and beauty, where the sight is open.
As long as the DEA is in possession of the status of list 1, without considering the medical effect, the US Department of Health and Social Affairs maintains a large-scale patent of cannabis for medical purposes.
DEA continues to establish marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as a potential drug with high dependence, even though DEA’s prime administrative judge Francis Jangs objected to it.
Strictly medically, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, 10 fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuana in order to incur death.
Marihuane is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to man.
Rationally analysed, marijuana can be safely used in the treatment under supervision.
It must be said again that it was proposed by the Dea judge himself.
And yet, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, all of us in our daily life accept some of the benefits.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it loud or we're so stupid or stupid that no one seems to have noticed it.
As far as the case is concerned in the context of the federal medical marijuana policy, there must be a capacity to present facts without delay.
The lives of patients, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose attacks are reduced by medical marijuana, and many other lives depend on it.
The fact that the plant can do so much good and remain behind closed doors is worth speaking at the highest level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donalds Trumps "Blondais Berlusconi"
Bloody Beetroots is known in electronic dance music context
The musicians say that Trump dominates the media like Berlusconi
You know, we've been to Berlusconi in Italy, and Tramps looks like Blonde Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music band "The Bloody Beetroots" told CNN.
The President of the Republic is a candidate and a politician, an Italian media magnet, both known for his overriding personality, the ability to attract the press attention and the changed story media.
In the composition of "Bloody Beetroots", Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with legendary Seru Polo Macartnius and ending with electropop singer Greta Svabo Becchi in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basano del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which coincided with the time of Pancrok’s birth, and the figures “1977” were placed on the chest.
"The English language is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black fee he is familiar with.
I am trying to explore, and I am trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited the Americans to look at "Videocracy", a documentary film that examines Berlusconi's monopoly on the Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy a trak," said Rifo, adding that Trampam had a similar effect on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and displace everything... by his own," he said.
I don't think Trump's good in this country.
Two Turkish sailors imprisoned in a prison of more than 500 million pounds in the drug market
Two Turkish men were convicted of worth more than 500 million pounds of cocaine smuggling on a North Sea ship, each being sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mother Sahins and Emin Ozmens were found guilty after a trial in the Supreme Court in Glázgova after about 100 juries from the Aberdina coast on the MV Hamal deck were found three tons of Class A drugs.
Persistence in 2015 is the largest shipment of cocaine held in Europe at any time in the sea.
Mominam Sahinam and Eminam Ozmenas sentenced a prison sentence for his role in a large-scale drug deal
The cargo found on the ship is one of the largest in British history
Drugs were found hidden in a particularly well-equipped shelter in Tanzania, which was registered from Istanbul to Tenerifi and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British fleet frigate "HMS Somerset" and the border force angle "HMC Valiant".
Sahin (47) was sentenced to 22 years, while Ozman (51) was sentenced to 20 years in the Supreme Court of Gázgow.
Justice Lord Kinklevens told men that the amount of drugs was not only "significant but ambitious", and drug smuggling has a "grassy effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said: "You have been involved in commercially in the most extensive operation, including the transport of cocaine by ships, in an operation that has crossed the international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said the captain of the ship Sahins was not a "drug at the end of the tree", but he had had an important role in the crime, while the second captain of Ozmen's role was "to some extent less".
The inspectors went up to "Hamal" on board following an introductory information from the French customs authority DNRED, and when it came to Aberden, they rushed through the steel plate, accessing a secret section where 128 soldiers were found with cocaine with a weight of 3,2 tonnes, as the approximate value in the black market is 512 million barrels.
"MV Hamal" last year checked the royal fleet.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
During the examination of the vessels, it was found that its ballast tanks are packed in tonnes of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the Bosphorus Sea to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this place was discovered under the cabinet in one of the crew’s premises, and the hole was cemented.
Sahins and Ozmen were found guilty in the transport and hiding of cocaine on board from 20 February to 23 April last year and in the supply of cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
Both uncondemned men who have worked in the shipping industry since the end of school continue to claim that they are not guilty, yet they take the oath.
The charges against four other men are missing evidence.
Sahina's lawyer, Jonathan Kravs, said that a married father of two children was "glorified clay".
He said, "Someone who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to drive a ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahins is certainly not a drug in the bottom of the tree, but a little lower.
Extensive quantity of cocaine on board means that it was to be transported by road
The police went through the entire ship for days before drugs were distributed through these boxes.
At Sahina asked questions about his captain's work on "Hamal" in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr. Krova said that he was "shocked" about the long-term important events of daughter (9) and son (13) and "just want to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since the arrest in April 2015, as families are still struggling to obtain visa approval.
Ozmen's lawyer Di Murs said that he "excellently" wants to see his family, but he knows that in the future it "will not be possible".
Speaking after today's judgments, the Scottish prosecutor, David Harvey, said: "The international drug trade has no frontier, and we, whose task is to destroy it, are increasingly working together to achieve that we are one step forward.
"The progress of Scotland in the prosecution of criminals is indeed global, and in this case we have caused significant economic losses to organised crime representatives."
Drugs were grounded in all the gaps on the ship, including under the floors.
The inspectors of this smuggling pack found a hidden vessel in the vessel's laundry area
Mr. Harvija added: "Hamal" was identified by the French authorities for information on the investigation, and by a rapid cooperation with Tanzania, where the ship was registered, a general prosecutor who also allowed to board the ship.
"Our investigation then came from Gijana, who gave access to important data on shipments, to Spain, which gave us very valuable information about the ship's detentions in the Canary Islands.
We also cooperated with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to combine specific evidence elements.
Despite the basic information that Hamal is being used to deal with a large amount of drugs, representatives of the British authorities in international waters on it were unable to dig without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something like what they had never given before.
Sju Peitena, Head of International Justice and Organised Crime Control of the Office of the Royal Criminal Cases (CPS), said: "By acting quickly and accurately, the CPS Criminal Court council was able to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board within 24 hours of receiving information.
Under international maritime law, British officials are not entitled to board international waters on board a vessel under the flag of another country unless that State grants a special legal authorisation to do so.
Without our criminal adviser's quick action, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people to responsibility.
Photographer Brians Romeidgens lives on the busy "East Express" train
Photographer Brians Romeos from Rotterdam has taken pictures of this abandoned train in Belgium
In images, the inside of the train is visible, the seats are hidden, the windows are covered with dust and the cabin of a narrow machine.
It has already been designated an Eastern Express wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian National Railway Company
The city explorer has taken these important photographs, which show that the remains of the passenger train have been one of the best modes of movement.
Its flowering times have long gone by, and the train wagon and locomotive have been left to feel the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photography and adventure search.
Photographer Brians Romeidgens, 40, has taken these terrible photographs, where the train’s rolling inside is visible, carved seats, dusted windows and the driver’s cab
The train wagon and locomotive have been left to feel the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photography and adventure search.
These trains were a symbol of cowardice when they operated under the legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
The Belgian National Railway Company was used by locomotives about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on track, the last train running with the name of the Eastern Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, closing the famous history phase.
Eastern expression was famous on the Paris - Istanbul route.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as the French language Express d'Orient.
It became the Eastern expression in 1891, and by the 1930s it had already been regularly traveled throughout Europe.
This should not be mixed with the private "Venice Simplon-Orient-Express".
And he's left a very small "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury car.
In this photograph, measuring instruments and open guides are still installed in the narrower machine cabin in which the equipment is in the basement.
Romans said that the machine cabin is "in its own way claustrophobic, and the locomotive noise must have been insurmountable."
The abandoned locomotive and wagon have become the object of a popular photography and adventure search.
After a forgotten train visit in Belgium, the Romans MailOnlineTravel said, "I could really feel how it was used in its flowering times."
Women are accompanied by beautiful garments by good - looking men on high heels.
Grima artist Ketrina Gelovey's overtop series "Arrested Development" in Blood
Thanks to her impressive healing skills, reviews and revalues, textile and YouTube censorship Ketlina Gelovje has joined the fan army.
However, her last conversions to the Buster Blut from "Arrested Development" are totally unbelievable by any standards.
In a three-minute video clip uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Gelova slowly and continuously turns itself into a failed image with a hook in place of the hand.
Even at the end of the clip, she uses an audio recording from this dangerous but at the same time excellent performance.
A talented clay artist begins his video in his, blonde woman's image.
Then, using slow photos, she slowly turns into a brilliant "memoral" that is already disposing of her hair, and that is Tony Heila Busters Bluts.
Gelovey does this with colored contact lenses, shadeing and pulling contours around the nose and eyes, and drawing Baster's face on his head.
Smart methods: Using slow photography, she slowly turns to Tony Heila Buster.
During her video, she also takes over the cult TV image personality and manners, also attracting teeth.
The clip inserted on YouTube has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and all of a sudden, famous comments by the artist:
"You're extremely talented," someone recorded under the video posted by Gelova.
During her video she also takes over the cult TV image personality and manners
"I like how you do it while you stay in the picture," someone else added.
Video blogger Ketlin Gelovey had already successfully converted to Ron Svenson's Parks and Recreation image.
She told her YouTube followers that in the future she was looking forward to creating grey conversions every week.

The Lancashire father is expelled from school for wearing a T-shirt with a bad name
The father of two children was expelled from the children's school for their arrival on their sports day in T-crekle with an offensive inscription.
Craigs Makbets (36) from the Children's City in Lankashira says that he "lost" when he drew a crack with the inscription "Laižam and Dr.!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his miscarriage and pulled the T-shirt vice versa, the next day he found that he was forbidden to enter the school territory.
The only father who worked for four years as the principal of the Park School in Cologne, Children, was unable to come behind children because of the ban, and the staff even summoned social services and police.
Craigs Makbets (36) from Children says that he was not admitted to school after having arrived on the children's sports day in an offensive T-shirt.
Mr. Childrenlija accuses the school director of Saru Midjulia of overreacting tears.
He says that he has been unjustly punished for having, before going to see his two children's competitions, the errors immediately attracted the T-shirt.
Father, who no longer works as a school manager, said, "It was a mistake and ignorance on my part."
I don't think about the sports day and I'm rushing when I pull it off.
Near the end of the event, we had our father's competition, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said it was inappropriate.
I apologized and cut it off on the other side, and that ended the case.
However, a 36-year-old man said that he had received a letter from the president of the school yesterday, where he was invited to a meeting with the director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"The school director then called me and said that I was forbidden to enter the school territory," said Mr. Bernley.
I learned that after the sports day some parents on Facebook had been worried about it and that many people were interested in it.
Anyone who is thought to be guilty would say that it is overconfident.
Mr. Makbeta, who is the editor of the online Love Mini magazine, said that he thought he could not even come behind the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this was a reason for calling from school and social services.
On T-crekle was the image of Craig Charlza Lister from the BBC cult comedy "Red Rouch" with one of his iconic statements "Laize and Dr.."
He said, "I told them I wasn't there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then he called me from the social services and asked why I wasn't behind the girl.
The school also called the police because I didn't come after the girl for 40 minutes."
Mr. Makbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer enter school and that the ban would be in force until further notices.
He also mentioned that he had been warned that he could apply 500 pounds of fines if he was affected by the violation of this rule.
Sarah Midjly, the principal of the Park School, said that the case is now over.
Sarah Midjly, Director of the Park Primary School, said, "I can confirm that Mr. McBeta has withdrawn from office and is no longer our school manager."
This case is now over, and I hope to return to my school life in September."
Children’s city counselor Joe Küney said that the school has clear policies and guidelines.
"We must all keep in mind that by taking up the position of an adviser or a leader, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not meet these standards," he said.
Counsellor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school should be banned and that he had been thrown out of the shell.
Mr. Nixon added: "The wearing of such a T-shirt was stupid, and he apologized for it too."
The Lancashire police confirmed that they had been called from school, but they did not.
In recent times, the VEF premises of the former factory, located on the streets of Freedom, have been renovated - there are several IT companies, the industry has already started to call this area a local Silicia valley.
The rest of the VEF area, including Bérzaunes, is also being developed.
The development and construction of the project for the 2nd class of the LU Academic Centre in Tornjakala will pay EUR 21 million.
He concluded a contract published by the University of Latvia on the design, construction and authorship of a second-class technical project at the University of Tornjakal, Riga, shows a notice from the Procurement Monitoring Office website.
The procurement is organised in the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of the contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with the public LNK Industry Group, which has committed to carrying out these works at EUR 21 186 560.
As explained by LU, the university, starting with the planning and implementation of the project planning period of the European Union Fund for 2014-2021, continues to develop the academic complex's next series - the building of the Science Centre - the design, authorship and construction, in line with the Skik project and the specified construction target.
The building of the Science Centre is similar to the building of the Science Centre, which is designed and constructed in the first place, and which is similar to that of the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as the scientific and academic staff and students in the building.
The competition rule was added to the SIA's Sixth style sketch project, which provided all possible suppliers with information about the academic development vision of the University of Tornkal, including a listing of the planned objects of the University of Latvian Academic Centre, indicating the name of each particular object, the expected area of the object, the planned object transfer in operation of the year and other information.
At the end of 2015, the 6th style of SIA carried out pre-designed meta corrections of the complex area of buildings complex of the University of Tornjakala in Latvia, which made it possible to specify the location of the academic centre buildings and their interconnection, as well as the transport organisation in and around the meta area.
Announces a tender for the application of the medicinal product in the road section.
The LAU is informed by the LAU by the LAU by the LAS Latvian Road Operator who has announced the purchase of a mechanised cure in the lanes of the road in the regions of Latvia and Pirīga.
The item is divided into 9 lots: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgavas, Rēzeknes, Valmieras, Talsu and Riga for the area of roads.
Applicants may submit an offer for one or more batches.
It is necessary to insert the product into the lanes of the road sections in order to improve the transparency of the roads and the surrounding areas, to promote the water flow from the road, and to limit the medicinal product’s seating and the formation of the body.
The most expensive product coating works are for farmers in the Tals road area for a total of 28 coaches in 637 km, in the Valmiera road area for 20 coaches in 432 km, and in Aluksne for 17 coaches in 384 km.
It has already been announced that in June, the company completed the product loading work on the main and most important regional asphalt roads, but on the smaller regional roads and on the local highways, the holder of part of the loading work was planning to trust farmers.
"We have the opportunity to make more effective use of the funding allocated to road maintenance works, while giving farmers the opportunity to make full use of the technique and to earn a profit," stressed the Chairman of the Board of Director Vladimir Kononov of the VAS Latvian Roads.
The time limit for submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Legal guardian: Demagogy of the compulsory health insurance model with an additional financial burden on citizens is not subject to any criticism.
Any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and substantial burden on citizens, is not subject to any criticism, is considered by law enforcement officer Juris Janson.
Janson met with Health Ministers Ando Chakš today to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, the journalists were told that the model of financing for the health sector offered by the Minister of Health is a sustainable and developed health care system that would make it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that additional funding for health care should be mentioned in this case, as it is not sufficient at the moment.
Janson also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and high-paying burden on citizens, is not subject to any criticism, especially when the Dutch model is called.
Janson said that the Netherlands allocates 11% of its gross domestic product to health, while Latvia is only 3%.
Therefore, the government and Parliament must be sufficiently responsible to understand that there is a need to rise from this point of meeting, the Ombudsman said, and added that the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) would otherwise not work.
Chuck thanked the lawyer for his support and pointed out that the main concerns are for the patient to be approached by a doctor, which means that the health care system needs additional funding.
The Minister pointed out, however, that the planned additional 35 million euros would only be possible next year to do the most accurate things for oncology patients and maternity specialists.
As a result, VM has developed a plan and has submitted a request for an additional EUR 41 million to be allocated to health care in order to reduce the numbers of specialists and investigations.
"The question of priorities is whether or not funds will be available," Chakša said.
This amount does not include an increase in remuneration for doctors.
Commenting on the fact that doctors are not interested in driving all three options of the health care financing model for the examination of VM to the government, including those that provide for additional payment for patients, Chaksa said that the government is given the opportunity to choose from all three models.
Janson also added that, by moving all three models, it is possible to show clearly that Latvia is not ready to impose an additional burden on the population.
It has already been reported that the VM will defend the variant of the health care financing model which does not provide for an increase in the overall tax burden, but requires part of the social tax to be shifted to health, says the summary of the concept report on the change in the financing model of the Latvian health care system.
At the same time, the Ministry pointed out that the best option for the financing of health care will be chosen as a result of discussions by the end of September.
Local jobs are ready.
Arbūsi has given up this year, the owner of Arūjs Rolands Dambis, in the municipality of Medzes.
The works are already purchased on the Liepaja market.
By producing several early varieties, but later bubbles well abandoned, the regional newspaper Kursa Time sends.
"This year the work is growing better than last year," says the great river grower in the village of Rucava.
In time, too, it was much more favorable summer than it was in the past when it was cold and windy.
The opening of the Liepaja theatre in Riga.
On August 12 and 13, the Dailes theatre will visit Liepaja’s theatre in Riga, offering to the viewers both the performances nominated for the “Play Night” award and the brilliant intrigue – the solo performance of the director of Liepaja’s theatre Herbert Laukstein, the portal “Delfi” informs the theatre representatives.
On the evening of 12 August, viewers will be presented with the human drama "Silion Man", invented by director Laura Groza-Cyber.
It is a story of a real historical person - John Mariku - who lived in the Victorian era in London and his body, because of the deformed body of the inherited disease, was invited to be Zilonjnhuman.
In the interview, the titler Egons Dombrovskis, who received the title of the title "The Night of the Games" for the representation of the role of the Americas, named "The Year of the Actier".
As critic Norman Aktos described his performance, Merik is "through the heart" a role in which the gender is not repeatable".
On 13 August, the presentation "Portraits" will be offered to viewers.
The exhibition received six "Game Night" nominations, including the "Year Big Form Exhibition".
The director has created an invention as a self-contained portrait gallery, while giving each play an important role, each of which has both a center and a background.
The display consists of a number of mini displays that are locked in a uniform health.
It is a observation of the nature of a man, where the main conflict is between true emotions and a cold calculation, by discovering how man changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf, who, for the sake of their wealth and benefit, splits up the surrounding, sometimes the sheep which has been split up by someone else.
On the other hand, both dates will be played in the Small Hall by the director of Liepaja theatre Herbert Laukstein "Man, who is more of the lift" in the Polish style of Galina.
It is not a sad story, but a full story of how a person’s only friend becomes an elevator.
Despite the capsulated stylisticity that dominates the visual image, the dominant intonation of the intruder is still bright and even optimistic.
"A man who is more of a lift" is not about loneliness and age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.
Also, if it turns out that there is nothing," critic Liga Ulbert wrote about the performance.
Tickets for all interviews can be bought in the "Billes' Paradise" box and online.
Detective Olga: My work is not a serial, but a real life.
I already have a half-way waiting for Olga Zeļik, the owner and investigator of the Riga Detectives Agency.
She smiles loudly and leaves a very positive impression on the person.
Dressed in white pants and in white jackets - a very elegant woman who embraces all my ideas about what a woman-detective should have.
She's waiting for me with champagne, which I'm gonna say good-bye.
I'm saying I spoke to her because I thought it was interesting that a woman was dealing with such an unusual thing.
It's always the work of men.
Olga has higher legal education - Master's degree.
He's been working with the criminal police in his own time.
You realized that he wanted something of his own and founded his company.
That's what you've learned.
"I really didn't want to go back to the police," Olga says.
It's routine.
There, in the criminal police, we were investigating cases, collecting information.
We work with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Riga Detective Agency."
She's calling for the anniversary celebrations: "There won't be a drink."
They're all solid people.
The question about her business, Olga says: "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a team.
Then I realized that sometimes working on a team is dangerous.
It's a business when, if someone does a non-professional job, they can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are fifth, then we're the second.
Spherical, of course, is not simple.
Many try to buy us out because we are involved in cheating on our marriage mate.
That's what people think!
Many come and ask if you can put on hearing aids, attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detective business is serious.
"It's information collection," says Olga.
If there is a crime under the law, I have to warn.
We call green teeth and laugh - to have at least a chest to hold and lead the negotiations.
I've been a client of my husband's.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have protection.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first, everything is always beautiful and good, but then it starts.
"It's the most dangerous thing," says Olga.
Psyche is broken, and what happens is that you can be treated like a wolf.
It could end badly.
God don't give it to me.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Many women try to leave their families and then return," she says.
I refuse the last order.
"That's the first time in my life," says Olga.
There was such a strange situation.
The woman was pregnant, she had a son.
"His husband beat his son and made him disabled," Olga recalls.
I believe that a woman has the instinct of mother, and first of all, she needs to protect her children.
When all this happened, she came to me with a request to be free of her husband.
There are people who are obsessed with activism.
The most dangerous thing is that the mother noticed it.
I can't understand it.
Her child is now disabled.
We couldn't find a body once, and the dog was very helpful.
The drug department can't go anywhere without dogs.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who don't have a whole psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are relevant.
Is there a divorce in the family, and information needs to be collected.
It's clear which side is the fault.
The last thing I had to do was think of other brothers and sisters.
That's interesting, because sometimes men smack, now women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women's "lost" threats of 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when traveling abroad because they can be sold in slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and have a lot of confidence," Olga says.
There have been cases when couples go abroad to get married a second time.
It's not legal.
Olga relates that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
It's growing up, it's maturing.
When I was 22, there was a tragedy.
He had a severe headache.
He returned as a completely different person.
"I'm his extract," Olga remembers.
It could be compared to hell, it was terrible.
The question is, what is the most unusual thing you've ever met, Olga says, "They're all special, but it's the most spectacular thing where trust is used."
When friends "get" friends.
Take away and don't give up the money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, another to be," Olga says.
The situations in which we deal with mistrust are extremely tense, as women are often not prepared to solve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unexpected situation, for man is not ready to lose his family.
Not every woman was willing to accept reality.
Often young girls who feel the taste of money use wealthy married men.
One man who pursued his wife said that she could not be loved because all the wives had deceived him.
"He had been married three times," Olga recalls.
At the same time, it is a man’s problem if all his wives cheat on him.
Olga tells of a case when a woman with all the children left her husband and asked him if he had ever raised his hand against her.
Above all, I kept looking at him, he answered.
In such cases, I will refuse to work.
I think it's interesting how things are handled - whether photographs are taken and shown to a living partner, if there's evidence of fraud.
How's it going?
"There is protection of the data of natural persons for the work of the palale detective," says Olga.
This is a challenging question.
One law allows everything to be done, the other does not allow anything.
For personal interest, we can take such photographs and videos, but not for public viewing.
If a case is brought before a court that does not comply with the law, there may be serious problems.
To become a detective, education and experience must also be mentally healthy and meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, it's handled by the police.
I tell clients - get out of the series, here is real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, they also had to use dogs, and they helped a lot.
"The drug department can't go anywhere without dogs," says Olga.
Some clients are looking at me in connection with the murder investigation, but I don't like taking such things.
These are very serious things.
Now there are more and more customers than men, because women tend to compete for men.
It used to be different.
Now women are having fun, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, most people suffer well," says Olga.
I like Deil's Carnegie.
He says - stop acting and start living real.
We all know that if you're on one side, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
You have to say that you're uncomfortable.
It must not be done.
You must not be afraid to lose what makes life miserable!
You must not become a minor, and what we are allowed to do with ourselves is what happens to us.
Yes, my first case was directly related to a man’s infidelity when the woman was not ready to accept the fact that the man was cheating on him.
She called all the time and asked what she was doing.
"I now ask all clients whether they are willing to accept the situation when they know that the man is really cheating on them," Olga says.
It's not fun, it's life.
If you're a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theater, it's a show, it's a real life.
I'm also an expert.
It is a heart thing and is related to Japanese medicine - hand-treated.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why did I start working on it?
This is associated with a large amount of adrenaline, and I need something to calm down myself.
Not only do we need to calm down, but it restores energy, light.
"People get out of my office positively and satisfied," Olga says.
She has enough signs at the wall office, and Olga tells us that they are written, not by a staff, but by fingers.
I didn't just go there, the book is literally in my hands.
Feel it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
You need to know more about it here.
Olga also sang.
It's her mood.
We're all in the mood.
I've been playing guitar for 11 years.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I am positive and smiling, but I have to rest to get back.
Others save alcohol, I need it.
Alcohol in the bush.
The police use it a lot because work is full of stress.
"It causes aggression, and walking can be unpredictable," she says.
I'm interested in sports and needs.
I'm 15 and I'm a tennis player.
I still needed horses.
I would like to write a book in nature, articles.
The detective's work has a narrow limit when work comes into your life.
"It is a work that should not be allowed to live," she says.
The question of how to combine work with private life is, Olga says, "My loved one is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
At that time there is the greatest love in my life.
I think enough about her, and I feel better already.
Detectives don't usually believe, but he's taken my job.
Actually, I'm separating work from private life.
I'm not the same in this business.
Needy's got me in the way.
Already when I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to the need, intuition opens up.
There's a lot of detectives, but they're really working - little.
In any case, it is work with the brain, and it is difficult to turn off.
You need rest, too.
"Wherever you can't come back," Olga admits.
The hardest case I've ever worked with is the Constance story.
I've been working on it for a year.
The man was literally joking about their woman.
I did so, however, that the child and his mother went to England - far from danger.
There was no other option.
We can't love each other.
We're looking for compassion.
You can't do that.
We have to rejoice in every day that we have.
Thank God.
Every day, three good things must be told to someone else.
A good work should be done or a day should be set aside.
We can't do that with men.
That's a big mistake.
We need to understand that there is a man next to us, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If it's not good, you have to go back and get away.
You can go to church, it has helped me a lot.
You don't have to be a fan, but you do what you like and help.
Nothing will change if you don't change, you have to leave and change your life.
You must never risk yourself and your children.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
Humans are created to do good and to support one another.
If God created us, we are already in need and are not devoted to this world.
You must never sit on the ground!
How better to prepare for the family photo session.
The summer is still in full swing, as is the immediate present of the current year of education that families are accustomed to enjoying in photos.
To illustrate how all will look happy and beautiful, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photo session in advance.
Ihappymama advises a multi-child mother, Alexander Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
It needs to be photographed in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
In the study, children find it much harder to feel and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style of clothing for the entire family, preferably in one color range.
For example, Alexandra tells us that she chooses clothing for all six family members so that the clothes are not more than three color tones and possibly less inscriptions on the clothes.
Don't forget about the good condition.
Ask yourself, joke, play, but don't bother, and don't psycho, if the kids aren't as obedient as they'd like right away.
And, behold, the following tips are already tasted from the professional photograph port charge!
You have to understand exactly what you want to experience during the photo session and tell me about their photograph.
Some of them will be beautiful, neat children and ideally made family image, others - "life is what it is," i.e., in their will to see true, true emotions, or how to love to say the photograph itself, - "escape-backs", "contained eyes", "surpassed deggingal".
Of course, it's possible that someone wants "two in one" too, but it happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photo session, you have to understand that they are only a few hours away from your life, and you're less likely to get started than better.
You are yourself - not the hard mom who works, prepares to eat, grows and continues to grow, and not the ever-lasting dad who talks on the phone.
And not the man who lives among you after an unknown plague.
Be a family, remember how wonderful it is to hug each other, to smile at each other, and to laugh at each other.
And then the task of a photographer will be to capture only the real moments of emotions that are in control among you.
If you choose a photograph, trust him.
Stop 250 times asking to show what has happened, listen to his advice in choosing clothing, instead of better frames.
Put all the necessary clothes on and off before the photo session day should no longer be handled.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the photo-session site (especially when photography takes place in the study and time is limited).
If you have young children, choose a time for photosession that corresponds to the day-to-day withdrawal regime, so that it does not happen at a time when the baby usually sleeps on a diner.
And, of course, don’t forget to take with your children food, vegetables, water and favorite toys (to use almonds and sweets only in extreme situations).
He prepares Dad that he may need to pull the bags, but he does not usually write them in these tips, and only the photographers know what the problem is, he recognizes Marina.
Do not drink much water before photosession and get well before it.
And it would still be advisable after the photo session to organize a party together.
Go to the attraction park, eat some ice cream, go to the ski slopes - which the family likes more.
At the same time, you will have received wonderful pictures and pleasant memories of the day shared together.
Krasnopjorovs and Fadejeva: Minimum wage for the economy - a miracle bird or a brake?
The issue of minimum wage raising in public debates is almost or is the status of the holy cow: either it is necessary to support the increase, or it is necessary to mention some unspoken, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (we have barely avoided technical recession), we believe it is important to stress that minimum wage raising is not a miracle that reduces income inequality with one home, closes to the level of Latvia's wage in Western Europe and fills the national budget.
On the other hand, if the minimum wage goes too far, it causes more damage than good, as it reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, especially in sectors and low-income regions.
In the first moment, despite a number of increases in the minimum wage during the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia does not seem to be so high as to reduce the competitiveness of businesses in the first few decades of the year - only EUR 370, while the minimum wage in some countries of the European Union (EU) is around half a thousand.
However, a different approach is open when compared to the average wage country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
As the proportion of the minimum wage beneficiaries in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6%[1]), the increase of the minimum wage is due to the majority of companies.
According to the Latvian Bank’s survey results, each of the five companies in Latvia replied that by increasing the minimum wage at the beginning of 2014, it was important or very important to increase the prices of the products.
This means that, firstly, the minimum wage increases were partly financed by consumers (i.e. Latvians); secondly, price increases for several companies meant loss of competitiveness on both the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports).
Due to lower competitiveness and smoke production levels, almost every fifteen-year-old Latvian company was important to release workers (i.e. higher unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleven companies replied that it was important for them to limit the employment of new employees.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if each five-year-old company considered improving productivity as an important factor in the assessment of the minimum wage for 2014, this does not mean that similar results could be expected in 2017 (the increase in the fourth minimum wage could in turn exacerbate productivity opportunities).
Another important result is - due to the increase in minimum wages, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees who earn more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for those companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the increase in minimum wages in all three Baltic countries exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Thus, the further increase in the minimum wage due to the increase in productivity (even though the overall low level of the euro is relatively low) will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
When assessing the validity of the minimum wage collection, it is not sufficient to analyse the average economic performance.
It is also necessary to assess whether the minimum wage is raised in the "panesome" sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most frequently used.
The results of the Latvian Bank's surveys show that employees with minimum wages have the highest concentration in small enterprises (the number of employees is between 10 and 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), could be more damaging by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining that already high unemployment) and promoting shadow economic sustainability.
Some of the signs show that the growth in the minimum wages implemented in 2014-2015 (a total of 27%) has slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that would so significantly leave the average wage from the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the minimum wage fixed by the country.
Lithuania's lowest wages are in the Tarage region, but also there were 54% of average wages in 2015 (after two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016 this figure could reach 58%).
In the public discussions, the time-consuming call for a minimum wage up to 68% of the average wage in the country (e.g. here) lacks an economic basis and is not implemented either in the short term or in the long term.
Firstly, such a high figure of average wages or even so close is not in any EU country.
Secondly, it would mean raising the minimum wage above average wages in several sectors of the economy (which would mean the bankruptcy and massive dismissal of these companies), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, food services and veterinary services; it is also more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
The minimum wage raising from January 2017 to €400-410 per month, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of average salary) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% and minimum wages are at least twice as fast, it has a clearly negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
Such negative effects will be most widespread in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is already often used, for example in Latvia.
The fact that we cannot now allow a significant increase in minimum wages means that other mechanisms must be used to support low wage beneficiaries.
An immediate effect can be achieved by means of an indispensable minimum of income tax (within the limits of budgetary possibilities).
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality of education, as well as unsatisfactory health status (which is often due to the greed and long-lasting range of medical services) are mentioned among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey, 521 responses from Latvia were received to the minimum wage increase in January 2014.
The survey took place within the framework of the project of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) of the European System of Central Banks.
These figures represent enterprises with a minimum of 10 employees.
It also explains the proportion of low employees with minimum wages in construction.
11 fires are registered in Latvia on the day of departure, according to operational information from the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
In the case of Latvia, the largest fires were fired in the village of Ogres novad Ogresgal, where 80 square meters of fuel units were unmanaged in the dwelling house and in the railway street in Jäkabpil, where with an open fire of fire filled with a clear beam in the 30 square meters area.
Firefighters also went on a Thursday to call for fuel waste, tyres, two light cars, building walls and ceilings, stoves, living roofs and food left unattended.
During the day, the service also participated in 21 rescue work.
No reports of death, injury or rescue have been received.
During the total day spent, the VUGD responded to 38 calls, six of which were misleading.

The legendary editor Hafington abandons "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Hafington, an influential U.S. media holder of "The Huffington Post" and editor-in-chief, announced the departure of the company after 11 years of work.
The "The Huffington Post" created in 2005 and awarded the Pulicera Prize, which offers every day both serious policy and economic journalism, as well as the reflection of internet sensations in entertainment, is seen as a source of media development at the time of rapid development of digital technology solutions.
The media, already starting work in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time under conditions where there was no Twitter yet, but the Facebook gained popularity only among students in national colleges.
Shortly after the re-election of the representative of the Republican Party, George Bush, in the position of President of the United States, Hafington did not hide that the media journalists represented liberal values, and with such a view of the world also prepared news material.
Now Hafington has found out that after leaving he is about to start a new business - he plans to create a "Trive Global" launch that would address the health and overload of employees.
In the meantime, it is not known who could take her place under the leadership of The Huffington Post.
During her work, the portal rejected anonymous comments, stressing to Hafington that freedom of speech is granted to people who stand up for what they say and who are not hiding behind anonymity.
She was also led to a decision in the summer of 2015 to publish the news section by Donald Trump, the US President.
The Court of Justice, at the end of 2015, stating that the trampa rhetoric is dangerous to the U.S. society, republished the news about the audioozo candidate in the policy section.
In 2011, it was reported that the US Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase the fast-growing news website "The Huffington Post", which visited almost 25 million readers each month at the time of the transaction.
The transaction amounted to $315 million.
In 2015, however, the huge Verizon telecommunications purchased AOL for $4.4 billion.
"Verizon" was also purchased in 2016 by Yahoo's online business.
With these transactions "The Huffington Post", an influential and independent media, became a small part of a huge corporation.
Currently, the content of the famous brand media is available in nine international versions, the total number of unique visits per month is estimated at 81 million.
Four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand.
During the last 24 hours, nine explosions have occurred in the southern provinces of Huahin, Thailand, with at least four people killed and several dozens injured, the authorities announced on Friday.
Two explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday at eight o'clock after the local time.
One blaster exploded in the basement in front of the sea police building, killing the municipal staff and hurting a man, the governor of the province of Vongsiri Promčana said in Surattāna.
"I think this is related to the explosions in Huahin," said the Governor.
The second explosion took place in front of the province police station.
On Friday morning in southern Thailand, two explosions took place on Phukete Island.
On Friday morning, two explosions exploded in Huahin at the bell tower, killing one and hurting three people.
It has already been reported that two explosions occurred in Huahin City shortly before the Thursday evening, killing one woman and hurting another 19 people, including foreigners.
The woman who was killed in Huahin on Thursday was a Timekeeper.
Of the 19 injured, three were in a serious situation, and seven of the injured were foreigners — four women and three men.
The bomb was hidden in Huahin in two wells, 50 meters from each other.
The syringes were detonated with mobile phones with a half hour difference.
Before that, on the fourth day, one man died in an explosion in the province of Trana in southern Thailand.
Police rescue infants from a car overcrowding; parents are threatened with a flashing glass with judicial work.
In Riga yesterday, municipal policemen rescued infants from a trafficked car, while the child’s parents threatened the police with judicial work on the glass of the car, the agency LETA informed the Riga City Police (RPP).
Yesterday, at the patrol, a man who told me that he had seen a car in Spice’s shopping centre in a car with no adult presence for half an hour.
On arrival at the site of the event, the vehicle indicated by the eyelid, placed in the sun position.
The front passenger seat was a baby seat with a baby.
The sun was shining directly on the child.
The baby cried out, was intensely breathing, and her shirt had been reddish and worn out.
In view of the fact that the owner of the vehicle did not appear on the spot, an immediate decision was taken to release the rear-view glass of the vehicle in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with all the seats is removed from the contact vehicle, and the doctor is summoned.
The child was breathing, the skin was reddish and hot, so before the doctors arrived, the guards on the wall imposed cold compressions.
At the same time, doctors and the parents of the child arrived at the scene.
The baby’s father, ingesting the window on his vehicle, remained aggressive and the doctors did not let the child in.
Talks have been conducted with parents and it is explained that children under the age of seven are prohibited from leaving one without supervision.
In addition, the child was left with health and life under dangerous circumstances.
After a discussion, the doctor examined the patients and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
On the other hand, the children’s parents categorically refused to provide any explanation about the incident and threatened with court proceedings about the glass of the car.
During the conversation with the parents, there was no indication that they would be in a state of alcoholism or that they could otherwise harm the child, so a four - month - old baby was taken into both care.
The material of the case has been sent to the Children's Prevention Department, whose staff will assess the responsibilities of parents.
The RPP recalls that even if the outside is not very hot, the car left in the sun will burn very quickly.
If a child or pet is left in such a car, it may endanger their life.
The LPF members could request the resignation of Poni.
The members of the Latvian Federation (LPF) could soon ask the Federation's president to cancel his current leader Kasparus Poni, the agency LETA told the Federation's former vice president, Janis Dhenis.
Jeanis said that given the criticism of Poni and his activities in the federation of the last days, several LPF members have signed a letter calling for a general meeting of the LPF, which is the highest federal institution, and it is right to decide on any issue raised in the LPF general meeting.
The members of the federation are not satisfied with the style of Pones management, as well as his going to the Riodeganeiro Olympics, which, in turn, were not able to go to the Latvian record of the Olympics by the swimmer Allãos Ribakovas coach German Jakubovski, is regarded as an unethical and undeservable act of the President.
Jeans pointed out that the LPF members, as well as the Secretary General of the Federation Aivars Platonovs, have done a great deal of work for the development of the federation and sport, but the contribution of the Ponies to the Federation is not very welcome.
Jean, who worked in the federation for a long time, explained that the federation was an attempt to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
Consequently, the members of the federation could also request the amendment of the regulatory statutes for the operation of the LPF which would exclude such a possibility in the future.
Jean explained that the dissatisfaction with the work of the Federation has been long past, but the events of the last days have served as members of the "last pillar" of the federation to decide that action should be taken.
The former Federation Vice-President said that the work of the Coach and Judicial Council was very limited during the work of the Pones.
Jeanis explained that, in order to ensure a faster process and the adoption of decisions in the Federation, the LPF members at a general meeting had decided on the authorisation of the board of directors consisting of Pone and two Vice-Presidents to run the Federation.
However, as Janis acknowledged, Pone joined the federation.
The members of the federation trusted Ponm, considering that this would make decisions in the federation more quickly.
"He committed the trust of the members because he practically took power in his hands by taking non-ethical steps," Janis said.
"This attitude cannot be one of those who should serve as an example to other sports representatives," Jeanis acknowledged.
According to Jean-Claude Pone, he has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which, in turn, does not honor him as the president of the LPF.
LETA told LPF Secretary-General Vladimir Maslovski that the letter could be submitted to the Federation next week and that the LPF's general meeting should be reached within a month.
In his view, the general meeting has "all the matters that have been hurt" and it must decide on the action to be taken.
Mr. Friday had not yet been informed that the LPF members were planning to convene a general meeting that could decide on his resignation from office.
In the meantime, I do not know anything about such a meeting, so I have no comment.
As for the fact that the members are not satisfied with my work, so far there has been only one case, with the former coach Jakubovski, when some dissatisfaction has been expressed.
Prior to the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and asked Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case, Jakubovskis lost his senior coach's job, because his actions were not in the interest of the LPF," said Mr.
He also pointed out that the meetings of the LPF members, which have been reported on their achievements, had not yet received their resignations.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the Federation's work has improved," said LPF President.
He also explained that there was no need to engage in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, but to work.
For most people in Latvia, it is not clear and they do not understand what the functions of the federation presidents are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these positions, and, for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive wages.
At the same time, we need to make sure that the sport federation is adequately financed, as only 10% of the required amount is received from the national LPF.
During the Olympics, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international federations and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"The negotiations have also been introduced and I have been working to make one of the stages of the World Cup in Riga in 2018," said Pone.
According to the company.lv portal data, in 2015 LPF revenues totaled EUR 249 444, which is less than EUR 36 000 in 2014.
About 40% of this amount was made up of the targeted grants received last year, with an increase of approximately EUR 10 000 compared to 2014.
Also, in the form of membership, accession and other annual contributions, the LPF received around 43% of revenues, namely EUR 109 442.
In the form of gifts and gifts, the Federation received an additional EUR 35,532 per year.
Previous federal expenditures compared to 2014 were increased by around EUR 70,000, totaling EUR 263 876 in 2015.
Major expenditure was not related to payments of money to persons, material expenditures, or salaries - 215 733 in the euro account referred to as "other expenditure".
Money payments for persons spent €20,549, while wages paid €14,684.
If the 2014 Federation had closed with a positive balance sheet, the 2015 LPF had closed with a negative balance sheet.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) requested an explanation to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) for the participation of LPF President Pone in the Olympic Games of Riodezaneiro, on the other hand, where the coach of the Latvian swimmer, Ribakovas, Jakubovskis, did not go.
Latvian nationals have not been affected by the explosions in Thailand, the record of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AM) on the social site Twitter shows.
The Ministry pointed out that according to the Latvian Consulate of Honor, the information available in Thailand was not affected by the public explosions of Latvia.
LETA has already reported that the AM calls for travellers to follow regularly with information on the political and security situation in the country and to make sure that the place of residence is safe, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia’s AM calls for avoiding places of assembly, to be particularly attentive and attentive, while staying in public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
Travellers who are in or are planning to move on to Thailand shall be invited by the Ministry to contact tour operators or airlines by specifying whether the journey will be carried out in accordance with the planned plan.
The Ministry also invites travellers to follow regularly with information on the development of the political and security situation in the country and to make sure that the place of residence is safe.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Given the unstable security situation in the country, AM does not recommend going to the border of Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces on the border of Thailand and Malaysia - Patany, Jala, Narathivata and Sonkhla.
In an emergency situation, the Ministry invites you to contact the Consular Department’s daily daily telephone service +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
Similarly, the AM strongly recommends that anyone who travels abroad, before travelling, acquires a life and health insurance policy, which also provides for repatriation in the event of illness or death, and is registered in the consular register.
Mess, however, will not miss Argentina's football selection.
The football superstar Lionel Mesi, however, decided to return to Argentina on Friday, the player himself announced.
In July, the second year of Argentina's election failed by a series of hard work at the finals of the Copa America tournament, in the decisive match again recognizing Chile's superiority.
Immediately after the loss, the Messiah announced that he would end his career in the state union, but it was then reported that he could return in the election.
"I seriously consider the possibility of getting out of the election, but my love for Argentina and the election is too great," 29-year-old Messi said.
The Spanish Grand Barcelona intruder Mesi in the ranks of the state union won 55 gates in 112 games, which is the best indicator of all time.
Together with the adult sample Messi had not been very successful, even though in 2014 Argentina became a world champion.
Mesi has been called the world's best football player five times.
For the Chinese, Jean and Dzelinas, double-dwelling Rio 20 km.
Chinese dreamers Vans Jeans and Cai Dzelins fought double-forced riodineiro Olympics 20 kilometers on Friday.
Jean was crowned as an Olympic champion, who spent 19 minutes and four seconds at a distance of 12 seconds at the end of the race.
On the other hand, the Australian salesman Dein Bärds-Smits, who lost Jean in 23 seconds, beat the bronze.
The householder, Kai Bonfims, corrected Brazil’s record, but he needed five seconds to climb to the honorary stand.
Four years ago, Jean received a bronze medal in London.
He also has two gold medals in the world’s championships at the same distance.
Judo Coach Baskins: Nikiforenko is not a real weight.
Latvian Jewish coach Olīg Baskin acknowledged with honesty that Arthur Nikiforenko Rio was not able to survive the severest Azerbaijani sportsman Ushangi Kukauri in the Olympics.
Practical opportunities were not limited, only if they were able to put them in some way or in a party.
We had already predicted it would be.
He was well - prepared, and he fought well, but the opponent was stronger.
The antidote was well known, because Nikiforenko had fought him twice and both of them lost.
He's tougher, though.
Arturus has been artificially transferred to the heavier weight category to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category up to 100 kilograms had already been borrowed, and Arthur used the European weight category.
Arthur, who weighed 100 pounds [100 kg], fought a Jew who had 140 pounds [40 kg] and who had won several major tournaments.
In the heavy weight category, there is a very little random moment at all.
If all the shifts in weight categories are mild in years, they are very rare.
On the question of whether Nikiforenko would further be better fighting one degree in the lightest weight category, Baskin replied positively.
I think we should - Arthur would be better off fighting in the category up to 100 kg.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the real weight.
65% of Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are willing to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to leave President Nikolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Elections Board announced that "no time" for the withdrawal of the vote this year, with which Chavism will be at the top of the power by 2019, people in the streets of Karakas continued their days of coming, as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I was looking at the Olympics and how Michael Felps got two more medals," said Rafael Deian, a 36-year-old office worker who rested in Altamir's field on Wednesday.
The area of Altamira, located in the eastern part of Karakas, was at the beginning of 2014, an asylum-free epicenter protested against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition has to exert greater pressure than ever before in order to achieve the referendum this year, people throughout the country no longer show such energy.
"I would like a referendum, but for reasons of security, I will not participate in the protests," Deian said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, yet admit that the Venetians are not so motivated.
The President of the Election Board, Tibieseis Lusen, comments that the government is hindering the process of revocation.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reijjess, (60), said Fox News Latino.
Therefore, in addition to all the barriers the government has raised to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces a new challenge: to motivate people to go out the streets and protest.
Recently, the referendum initiative has had extensive support - in the process of collecting the signatures, people have arrived in an unprecedented number of dome.
However, when it comes to protesting against government movements to block efforts, the number of miners is likely to be smaller.
"Some people focus on the creation of food lines, while others are afraid after 2014 arrests and deaths," said Cipriano Eredia, opposition legislator.
After Lusena announced that before the next step of the referendum process - even more sign-taking across the country - would have to wait until October, those who oppose the socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to remove Venezuelan courage by making them believe that the vote is practically impossible this year.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum was held in 2017, Maduro could be removed from office, but he would be allowed to appoint the next president.
If he was left out today, he has an obligation to declare general elections.
The US Department of State addressed this issue in a statement on Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure compliance with Venezuelan constitutional rights.
"The last steps towards the implementation of the presidential referendum must be made clear, concrete and immediate, thus contributing to the rapid and effective resolution of the political, economic and social difficulties of the current country," it said.
Luis Salamanka, political analyst, who was a member of the election board between 2006 and 2009, that changes are not expected so soon.
"I thought there would be no referendum this year unless the social unrest and protests would become even stronger," he said to the FNL.
He said that Lusena and the government were violating the law, but as a result, they would achieve their goal if people did not protest.
The opposition called for a wide-ranging demonstration in September. First, in Karakas to demand that the process be speeded up so that recall could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilized in the capital this day.
The government will feel the pressure," Eredia said.
Salamanka, on the other hand, believes that this situation cannot be expected for so long.
"They should respond to the Lusena Communication faster and stronger, because it practically kills the referendum," said FNL expert.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties want to make the demonstration happen faster, but another group wants more time to organise.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the second signing campaign activity will be low," Salamanka said.
The referendum process to activate it must be supported by 20 per cent of the national voters, who are almost 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analysts are confident that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavasmo will be offended.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government closes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal possibilities," Eredia said to the FNL.
The Directors of LNSC, A.Pučíti, shall be represented on a temporary basis.
At the extraordinary meeting of the council of the municipality of Big Várdas on 12 August, the majority supported the resignation of the director of the municipality of Big Várdas Sport Centre (LNSC) of Ainara Pučiša from the performance of his duties for the period of service inspection.

Ogros seniors have a holiday.
Today, the Sports Festival of Ogres pensioners took place at the stadium of the centre of Sport.
The senior stage was hosted by the organizer Sanita Taurinja, who had prepared a special programme for participants in the Sports Festival.
There will be no evaluation of individual results at this time, but participants in sports holidays will be divided into four teams.
"Each participant will meet as a result of the team," explains S.Taurinja.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball speeds, Eiffel tower building together with memory game, florbola fitness staff, summer hiding.
In order to successfully launch all four-week program disciplines, participants had to carry out the heating tasks - "Unity circle", "Rinča dancis", "Impletnis", and three stadiums - with horses, to carry out the Frisbian and Badminton elements.
All the tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and the participants performed them with joyful, smiley and funny comments, supporting each other.
A special sensation led to summer hiding, which took place in the organizer’s clothes.
The competition followed closely with the volunteers of the centre of the town of Ogres Sports, who conducted the tasks, fixed the results and did not interfere with the advice.
There was also the symbol of Ogres Čikurs, who inspired the participants of the Sports Festival.
Ogros seniors proved that they are quite healthy, attractive and are in good sport.
Green team representative Peter Zeps, who had just spent eight times in a minute, had just one successful year in the basketball game, was released by his team member, Janis Staudžs.
In Hungary pensioners are active.
On excursions, buses are always full, and there are about 300 people on the ball.
"We meet twice a week in the rooms of the Family Support Centre, where we can play new, table tennis, use coaches," says the president of the Ogres Pensioner Society, Janis Staudžs.
At the end of the sports holidays, all participants received thanks to the Sports Centre of Ogres novads, but the greatest benefit is fresh air, good weather and shared time.
2016/2017 Preliminary provision No 19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict position 14 (Note: it's not just Alan Smith's forecast, but our journalists' advice in general)
Item 14 of last season
The prospect of winning the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week it looked after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will once again be a struggle for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how much "empty is glass" under Tony Pulis' leadership.
However, Jeremiah Pius sold 88% of his club shares to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, in an architecturally safe hand, which the bukmeikers immediately made to be a favorite in the unfavorable first discounted manager's role.
The situation has inevitably changed Balack Country - and not only Hawthorns, but also some of the jealousy in the north-west Volverhampton, where the new Chinese owners, while not wasting time, refused to provide services to Kenya Jacket.
To confirm that his work is not immediately threatened, however, the company has also expressed its desire not to change club culture.
"I don't want to change the trusts of the club or start an unsustainable sensitisation," he said, taking over responsibilities.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our goal is to ensure that we remain the Prime Minister and then go further, I would like to see the club at the top of the division.
I think it's the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Púlis, and the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break down to the top of the table, but the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base will be important to look forward to a quick draw in the table above to find out that this is an extremely difficult task, taking into account the basic work that has recently invested in the other side of the table.
To go beyond the 14th place of the past season, to get up there, there will certainly be more work to do.
Only Aston Villa, which is located at the bottom of the table, enters the lower gate and is worth recalling that the Christmas Albion averaged less than one stone by the gate in 90 minutes, almost or the worst indicator of the division.
They failed to obtain gates 13 of the 38 games and enter more than one gate in only nine games.
Out of their 10 wins in no game failed to get more than one gate, and the seven games ended with 1-0.
As expected, a total of 34 gates were taken from standard positions.
There is no wonder that Hawthorn's team ruled dissatisfaction, possibly most visible after the shocking 0-0 was not separated by Villa at the end of January when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only six of the best teams had better protection indicators - although no club has been able to include the four side guards on the list.
These safeguards are often not sufficiently assessed, especially by John Evans, who wants to be Arsenal, taking into account their recent crisis in the sense of the guilty players.
The Northern Ireland International Team has had a great start at the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend a lot of time in order to sell.
Ben Foster's doors are reliable, and they are well integrated in the middle line.
Darens Flechers, much like Evans, showed to a large extent that he was still able to play at a high level at 32 years of age, and Claudio Jacobs was underestimated.
It is disturbing to all parties that the long and lycocaine story of the future of Saido Berahino is still unclear.
In short, the owner's rates from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected, but they still maintain peace and Mark Hijudgs is ready to wait.
After the last season, being close to the liquidation, it is worth acting on all the parties involved.
The climber is certainly talented, but as Pulis has mentioned several times, he has been on one side, on the other side, for a long time, it has been visible that such relationships are not working.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the documents for the change before allowing the former UK U-21 sampler to go, but his 15 million worth of walking with Diafro Saho disappeared a few days before taking over, claiming that he had passed medical examination and had all agreed, but he had a back injury which meant that he would have to release the beginning of the season.
This brings great pressure on the Venezuelan Solomon Rondon, who in the past season looked very polite, but he needs to improve the performance of his nine gates, especially if Rickie Lamberts continues to be so inefficient.
The decision to release Viktor Anicèbi and Stefan Sesegnon's retrospectives also seems strange.
Puliss in his entire career is sadly famous with his slow new players moving up and three tunes - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts' appearance in the last season of the previous season with undisclosed 1-1 with Liverpool, almost or will become a norm.
He will return to those who have already tried and tested, but Leko is worth keeping in sight.
The 17-year-old gunman, in general, participated in five games during the previous season, becoming the first female player in 1999, who is also highly valued in the English football system.
Mets Phillips, with a 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he's the only new player who took part in the first week of the game.
It would not be safe to say if the end could be rather urgent.
"All," Pulis said in the past, "Express and Star about what would be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen the back players, the middle players in the field and the players in the front positions.
Targets are, we know what we want.
They appear to be much more difficult than expected, mainly uncertainty about the takeover process.
The season could determine how they began, with seven to a great extent winning games before the difficult competition with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
At that time the pressure on Pulis will become less or impossible.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will find a new club.
Tata Steel UK is closer to the rescue transaction after the authorised changes in pension support
Behind Tata Steel UK's pension authorities said that the scheme could be restructured without involving the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) by increasing the company's ability to conclude a rescue transaction.
The British steel sector's pension scheme has a commitment of 15 billion sterling bills and is estimated to be at least 700 million sterling bills deficit, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the business of Britain, which employs 11,000 people, ensuring the future after negotiations with the Minister of Economic Affairs and Pension Regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including business with ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alans Johnson, the pension president, said that this scheme could avoid the PPF if the benefits received by employees were modified.
Although this is well funded compared to other schemes, with a deficit narrowed to 300 million pounds for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its liabilities.
Johnson said that the authorities recognize that it is "not real" to the joint venture or to any Tata Steel Uk buyer to assume responsibility for financing the current and future deficits.
The modification of the benefits obtained from the scheme was a much more binding option than the addition of the PPF, he added, where workers should accept the most advantageous conditions.
Tata Steel sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel mines, since the negotiations on the future of its business in the United Kingdom began in March, and this has been put in place as a short-term negotiations with the British government.
Kusiks Chaterje, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable".
Speaking at the Tata Steel Annual Meeting in India, Chatterie said that the negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes were moving forward, but he argued that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to different stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Wales Government, etc."
There is an opinion that pensions have a known impact on goods such as steel business, so we need to find a structural solution that does not lead the business forward.
The authorised wish to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
The potential changes in the scheme include the direction of how the increase in annual inflation-based benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index and the limitation of future pension payments to the minimum laid down by law.
Johnson added: "The CEO and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period and a low level of risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not affected the decline in the market in recent securities in the same way as in other UK pension schemes. We are still convinced that the scheme is capable of providing benefits at the proper level.
CBS commenter joins Michael Felps and Rayen Lohti in all lengths of the competition
The comment by the Canadian radio organization CBC The Olympic Games on Thursday evening caused anger by mixing Michael Felps with his rival Rayen Lohti.
Eliot Friedmans both enjoyed all 200 m of individual swimming length, where Felps won, honoring his 22nd Olympic gold medal.
When Felps crossed the line, Friedman held her for Lohti, the Felps people and already the old competitors of the world's top swimmers.
The man called out, "He'll do it at last!"
Rains Lohte will beat Michael Felps in this game!
Felps could not even get to the honor stand.
But Felps won, but Lohte finished the fourth.
Immediately after Felps was at the gold, the CBS transmitted the silence.
In a miraculous way, the pope even admitted his error.
I'm sorry, I mixed up the roads.
Felps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism was widely appreciated by error, once again acknowledged his error and apologized to the Twitter viewers within the next hour.
I'm sorry.
I'm surprised.
"No justification," he wrote.
At the time, Felps survived 2,168 years of record as a full-time Olympic winner.
The previous record belonged to Leonidad from Rhode Island, who played more Olympics than anyone else in the ancient Olympics.
Russian hackers attacked the former NATO Force Commander's computer.
The hackers published General Philip Bridlov's lists and data on one of Soros' funds.
The same hackers, who had been able to have carried out an attack on the US Democratic Party's e-mails and published its lists, could also be guilty of a new series of attacks, reports Bloomberg.
According to its information, these cyber attacks were carried out against the former NATO Commander General Filip Bridlov's list and the services of the Open Society Institute, which are part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
Drivers have published the information obtained on the DCLeaks.com link.
There is a list and data on the operation of the Open Society Institute.
It is reported that hackers have had access to the Fund's computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that this is about the same hackers who attacked the US Democratic Party's computers that are run by the Russian Squad.
The U.S. Investigator has already warned high-level officials of Congress about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party.
The news agency "Reuters" reports that it has information that the missionaries have told a number of politicians at the time - cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence officers or their controlled organisations.
However, Congressionals were unable to pass this information on to the victims of cyberattacks, since it was hidden.
The scandal about attacks on the Democratic Party's computers began after about 20,000 e-mails were published online, written by the party's representatives during the presidential campaign.
The party candidate, Hilaria Clinton, announced that the release of these letters was organised by Russian envoys.
Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has announced that Russia has no connection with cyberterrorists.

Disneyland has come up with information on its long planned site structure, consisting of a transport pool and a new touring bridge on the east side of the park.
The project, located in the east of the attraction park in the vicinity of Freeway, includes a 6 800-place parking structure and transport hub, where buses, buses, taxis and other vehicles can release visitors to the park.

The transport unit will replace the commercial property acquired in 2014.
The project is to be opened in 2018.

Two thirds of its population will have to be accepted for heating in Liepa’s home.
If the owners of the apartments are very loud and specifically speaking about the technical condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and to arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is the fact that EU co-financing from this year on can be obtained from any multi-dwelling house, only a condition is that the façade of the building must be necessarily heated.
In the past, it could be used only in a series of multi-dwelling houses.
The biggest roots for housekeepers are the organization of meeting of apartment owners.
The important problem where this process is now being collected is that 67% of apartment owners are required to agree.
"The previous programme required 51%," says SIA "The Home Manager of Liepaja" (LNA) project manager Toms Círulis.
"Of course it is very difficult to ensure this because, in most collections, the number of owners of such apartments does not occur," said Project Manager Gints Ločmelis of Home Service APSE.
The largest housekeepers in Liepaja - House Service APSE and LNA, which serve about 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 multi-dwelling homes by 2020 during the new programming period.
They do not rule out the possibility that it will be difficult at the beginning to convince people to vote for renovation work, but the attitude of the citizens of each project implemented should be improved.
I also needed a bank loan, 76% of the population.
"In explaining what will be - but I have produced them," the oldest Vita Iesalniece of the most energy efficient buildings in Latvia points out.
She agrees with John, who also lives in a warm building.
Well, it can't be that the side is making up, and the other side plus one person doesn't agree.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agrees with the whole measure," says Janis.
Altum representatives of the financial institution have proposed an amendment to such provisions.
They explain that with 51% of the number of votes in banks, it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has also been experienced during the last programming period.
Most commercial banks require two thirds of the owners of apartments.
As one of the recommendations for home managers, the head of Anda Lagzdinja, the European Union's Department of Finance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has the opportunity to present to the public the existing examples and the various benefits that will result from the renovation of the building, such as energy saving.
In the new world, Aaron had a long history of his mother’s death.
The operation of the potential suicide bomber's arrest operation in Canada was worthy of the press film.
It all started when the Canadian police received a video captured by the US Federal Investigation Office.
Very early this morning, the Royal Police of Canada received reliable information from the Federal Investigation Office.
Among other things, it contained a video of the so-called "mocelle" recorded by an unknown person who was clearly present in the final stage of the attack.
"And he was going to work it with a self-adhesive spark," said Deputy Chief of Police of Canada, Mike Kabana.
In the video, a man dressed in black masks in English and Arabic posed threats to Canadians and promised to act on everything they had done to Muslims.
In about three hours, using facial and voice recognition software, the Canadian police have managed to recognize this man.
It was 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the Probation Service about celebrating the idea of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
By judgment of the Court, Driver was forbidden to do so further and also to participate in any radical organisation.
However, the authorities did not consider that the Driver could create a physical threat to the environment until then.
When the police arrived at his apartment in Stratro, in the province of Ontario, the new man came out and sat in a taxi.
At that time, the guards tried to arrest him, but Driver, sitting on the back seat, had started a spark.
To prevent the detonation of the second spray, the police shot the new man.
From the trauma he suffered, he died.
The cabometer driver is not solid.
In a neutralized terrorist interview, Wayne Driver told Canadian television that his son had turned to Islam in his teens.
It had helped him to deal with drugs and alcohol at first.
Yet, Aaron was a troubled teenager, who was a long - term nymph to the world about his mother’s death.
Just when I saw the video in the news today, I could see how far he had gone.
I had no feeling that he was so radical.
"But I also didn't know that he was so good at speaking Arabic," says Aaron's father.
Canadian police recognize that if they had arrived a few hours later, the development of events could have been quite different.
Radeviča will go to Rio as a tourist and will support Latvian lighthouses.
The former Olympics and Lightweight Ineta Radeviča LTV in the Olympics said that the performance of seven sportsmen Laura Ikaunieces-Admidės Friday in the first two disciplines was not bad, given that the athlete had a trauma.
On the other hand, Laura’s exuberance was done with a good foot, not as usual with the left.
Radeviča pointed out that this is comparable - just as a person who experiences writing with the right hand would suddenly be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, the result of Icaunieces-Admidina in view of the trauma is not bad.
Radeviča discovered that in the meantime he has not yet contacted Ikaunieci-Admidini, but actively follows with her beginnings and feels with her.
Ineta learned about Laura’s trauma recently and expressed support for the athlete, stating that the delay did not begin to create a safety shield, but showed the character and the spirit of the fighter.
In other sports, Radeviča believes that the Olympic laws are very high, so one of the Latvian athletes is to transfer that he went to Rio as a tourist, is wrong.
She recalled that she herself was called a tourist, and this caused negative emotions when she went to the first Olympics, where she fought for 13th place.
Ineta sometimes remembers its beginnings, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results," Raděviča discovered.
She told me that it was always important to have a person in the courts who gave the energy of coexistence.
Raděvič will, however, be a tourist this year - she will be going to Riodezneiro next week to support Latvian athletes in the presence.
She points out that she will definitely go to the athletic contests.
Ineta Radeviča won the European champion's title in 2010.
In 2004 in the Olympic Games in Athens, she took 13 seats in the distance and 20 positions in the triple oil, but in 2008 the sportsman did not start because he was waiting for his son.
In London, Radeviči had a 4th place to travel.
In the walls, the film "Quanta Code" will be shown by physicists in Kaštjevi's main role.
The film's note says that parallel to the breaking of electrons in the laboratory Kaštjevs is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civilist man and father who is looking for a connection with Visvarano.
The film hero himself pointed out in the Latvian TV broadcast "Rita Panorama" that he had had an interesting experience.
I learned how to make a movie, how to film it, how to record a sound.
"And really fantastic work," said the physicist.
He admitted that the film was two years old.
The biggest disagreements with the directors were about the name of the film.
I'm categorically against this name.
No quantum code.
"There is no secret that, when watching the film, could know and is all clear," added the professor associated with LU.
Kaštjevs admitted that he liked the fact that the movie’s premieres were going to take place in the evening of Murjan’s free movie.
They are organized by friends from the "Eiegli" fund, and these cinematics will take place every evening until 9 September.
In Thailand, four people were killed in bomb explosions at the sight of tourists
After the Thai people voted in favour of the adoption of the military-supported Constitution, Thursday and Friday in the five southern provinces of Thailand - in popular tourist destinations - a number of bomb blasts occurred in which four people were killed and many people were injured.
The first two explosions take place at the seaside resort in Huahina on Thursday evening, next Friday morning.
The city is about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok.
The police reported that in the first explosion one Thai woman was killed and 20 people were injured, 10 of them were foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions occurred in the southern cities of Phuket, Tran and Surathan.
Two bombs are blown up in Phukutas in Patonta and two more in Phanna province - in the tourist region north of Phuketa.
During the last 24 hours, 11 bombs have been fired in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Krisana Patanačaroen of the Royal Police Officer of Thailand announced that the explosions were not related to Islamic extremists and were considered to be local acts of sabotage.
"It's still too early to make conclusions," he said.
"But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly linked to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is a local-scale sabotage, and we are trying to find guilty people."
On 12 August 2016, the investigators gathered evidence from the crime scene after a small power bomb.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people were killed in a series of bomb explosions in important tourism areas in Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorist attacks.
"That is why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack, and no specific group has been accused by the competent authorities, but the explosion occurred the same week the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phuketa and Phanna - have rejected the military-supported referendum, and in the south-eastern provinces of Thailand, where most of the population are Muslims, more than 6,500 people have died in peace since 2004.
The event took place on the day of the birth of the Syrian king of Thailand, which is the day of the national holiday in Thailand.
The capital of the King is Klai Kangwon, or "city far from the roots", where the royal family of Thailand is often kept.
King Bumibol Adoljade was the world’s most powerful monarch.

Portugal and Besa - which we have earned a long time ago!
There are endless numbers of operas that have never been scanned in Latvia.
And that's very rare.
However, it seems to be wrong if, in the 1970s, George Gürschvina's Opuss Porgy and Besa has not been studied or replayed since the last century, there is no such thing as the sumertime periodic display on the scene (including the title work at the Summer Festival held by Ines Galantes), certain student projects, guest shows and so on.
It has its own reasons - since Latvia is a civilized Western state, it has binding the rules and copyright licenses of the Güršvina family, which are valid for Portugal and Besu until 2030.
The harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, the author wanted all fourteen soloists to be black.
In Latvia, of course, the existing discussions and contexts of this opera in the US are not known and the composer's desire to perform would be difficult.
The concert held on the way to compromise with four black American soloists and the help of their Latvian brothers and sisters on August 6th was staged at Cēsis Art Festival on the 10th of July, recalling the beautiful song of Göršvina, in which her European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, ladies, the early 20th century’s fashion dances and the remaining hits in memory, showing the famous Katfishrov dome in the Ubag of Portugal and the light music lovers in the musical quality of Besas, who had earned a record for the musical life story rings.
First, LNSO and director Andra Pogas.
Despite the complex location of the concert venue in the city park, the orchestra was located on the side of the scene next to the audience, on which the soloist and singer (and excellent singing!) choir While, the overall scan was stylisticly toned, the contrasts rich and precise in both stylized and metal-puzzled instruments and pianos (Martinis Zilberts).
Second, because of the excellent soloist team.
The charismatic dramatic baritone Lester Linčs (Portugal) is a popular singer in Europe and America, whose repertoire includes both baritone and basbaritone parties, especially Verdi operas.
Portugal's role has been countless times, as well as the Krauna - he felt as a fish in the water in this operation and inspired viewers even at concerts to excite the emotional atmosphere of solidarity between the fishing villages of poor people.
Latvia Mura in her second concert venue in Portugal and Besa (the first in 2012 was no more, no less than with Berlin Philharmonics and Ser Simone Retlu) found itself as a vitally plastic vocal-style combination with dramaticly toned tembra and fantastic piano in the top register.
She is one of the most famous today's Aidas.
Attractive Jamaican tennis player Germain Smitt, Andris Poga, who was in Boston at the time, is an image of the drug dealer Sportinlifa, a company in four continents.
In it he demonstrates his skills of singing and singing as a well-trained music actor.
Smit is one of the rare cleans found in the vote, which seems to still conceal the undiscovered vocal opportunities as 15 years ago when the opera was accidentally found by caring it to smear the unicorns.
It is unlikely that even from the 24th and relatively dark German Smith’s expressive language, it allows him to see the dusty bag of happiness in his hands even if it is not there.
How could the poor Besa fail to follow such a mephistophilic charmer, who in vain causes the illusion of a wonderful life in New York City?
The role of the blood was created by Rodney Clarks, a gift - giver.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team of Cēsus was Sonora's Child's Regiment of Sirina - a bold top record, a skilled balance between the spoken and sung text, according to a change of voice position, the performance of vocal acrobatics and dramatism both in Sirina's favourite My Man is Gone Now and in the stylized prayer of the predecessor Oh, Doctor Jesus.
The clairvoyant played a well-scanned Margaritas Wilson's voice, but the iconic Summertime itself sparked a little bit of noise and nervousness when it gained its true character in its replay.
The dyes and ornaments were carved out by Mikhail Chuilpajev, Rihard Macankovski, Andrim Lapiņas (especially by the Krabs seller on the city walls in response to Irmas Pavāre's lovely Soprano seller in the soprano test).
Ilonas Bageles, Riharda Miller, Emila Kivleniek's paintings, as well as the role played by Ivo Martinson, a prominent investigator and a white lawyer in the image of Extradela, the director of the Cēsis Festival and actor Juris Žagars, were not expected to be present.
In the spatial design of the concert hall in Kairis, the choir worked on steps, mainly in the procession, rarely coming up or going up the stairs.
In a rather dynamic exercise, a little comical situation took place in the hands of Latvian soloists.
Their presence, however, has an entirely pro-active explanation.
First, some soloists sang several epic roles (sometimes made it difficult to trace the identity of their audience).
Secondly, there is a lot of dialogue in Portugal and Bessa, in the conversation of the phrases, a replica, which is easier to track with in front of the scenes.
Listeners were greatly helped by a titre machine in Cēsis to get into the opera's art nuances.
The timing was not maintained and the first part of the concert was long enough.
However, it did not stop most of the listeners from staying until the end of the day to entertain the artists.
The nine evenings are quite a time to start full-length operas, especially if a longer journey from Cēsis is expected, but opera Portugal and Besa have returned to Latvia's music course and will probably become one of the most exciting music experiences this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it appeared yesterday evening and in other acoustic conditions.
In the Russian field, the man was afraid of the children with a bow.
Yesterday, August 11, at eight o’clock in the evening, the State police received news from a beloved mother of a child, who was concerned that a man in the street of Lomonosova, in a child’s field, was in fear of children.
The lawmakers immediately responded to the call and arrived at the scene, where they also met this man with a worm, who at the time was very heavy in alcoholism - 3.07 promiles.
It was found that in 1962 the man who was born had already feared children so that they would not be perfect.
This time, however, an aggressive man used a worm that was strapped on the child’s field equipment.
The man was arrested.
In connection with the criminal proceedings initiated on the violation of gross public order, which is manifestly disrespectful to the public or to the public, disregarding the rules of conduct adopted and disrupting human peace.
Such a crime shall be punishable by the withdrawal of liberty for a period of up to two years, or by the withdrawal of temporary liberty, or by forced labour, or by the penalty of money, and by the supervision of the trial for a period of up to three years.
The presidents of the Federation in the Olympic Games usually use guest accreditations.
The presidents of the sports federations usually come to the Olympics for a few days and use the guest accreditations that allow them to change their names, so they have several owners during the competition, LETA told the agency the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV).
On Wednesday, a wide-ranging axiom was triggered by the remarks made by Allon Ribakov coach German Jakubovska, who discovered that at the last moment in Riodjeneiro Olympics decided to go to the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) leader Kaspars Pone, while the coach had to stay home.
Later it became known that Mr. Brazil had come with coach accreditation, which the president himself said surprised, because "now there is nowhere inside".
As told by Vilcinas, only two federation presidents - Pone, as well as the head of the Latvian Veglatletika Union (LVS) in the London Olympic Games, lived in the village of sportsmen.
In the Olympic village, sportsmen live as well as officials, including coaches, doctors, delegation administration.
Thus, it is likely that London Ponem was also accredited as a coach.
"The former federation presidents come as guests, and they have different accreditations - they come for a few days and then use someone else," said Vulcinis, explaining that the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village either.
Mr. Riodezaneiro arrived at the end of July, leaving Brazil on 13th, and he will probably be there the easiest of the presidents of all the national federations.
Significantly, Latvia started only one day in the swimming season - 10th of August.
Latvia Riodežaneiro will be represented in 11 sports games, and the Agency's LETA calculations show that the presidents of the six or seven federations will be driving for the four most important competitions.
Zālitis will be in Brazil on Saturday, President Igo Japiņš of the Latvian Rising Federation (LRF) will be attending the BMX competitions scheduled next week, President of the Latvian Windserfing Federation Ansis Dāle to Riodežaneiro scheduled to fly on 16th of August, when the beginnings of Ketia Birzulai have already been completed, and President of the Russian Federation Dzintars Urbančiks - the day before.
The next week, also planned to join the Latvian Shooting Federation President Kārlis Krēsliņš, when the shooter Dainim Uppelniek's start has already been completed.
The president of the Latvian Judo Federation Raymonds Rublovskis at least did not find Riodežanire during the Latvian sports competition, although his arrival was planned, the Latvian Canoe Federation is currently not the president, but the conflict will continue in Latvia’s dating society and its athletes apply to the international competitions of the Latvian Olympic Committee.
In the meantime, the president of the Latvian Volaibola Federation, Atis Drynītis, and the head of the Latvian Tennis Union, Juris Savickis, decided not to become a Riodežaneiro.
Vasiliev is evaluating the natural breast of Latvian women.
The world famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, screenwriter, book author, reader and collector Aleksandr Vasilijev is very often visited in Latvia over the last few years.
Recently, he finally praised the competitors "Mis and Misters Latvija 2016" and acknowledged that, unlike the Russian women's sex representatives, Latvians can boast with natural breasts and lips that have not been improved with silicone and botulinal injections.
In a conversation with "Vakara News", Aleksandr Vasiliev told us that for years the jury has been the president of the popular "Mis Russia" beauty competition.
That is why he was also very interested in evaluating the participants "Mis and Misters Latvia 2016".
At the request of different standards of Latvian beauty competition from similar competitions in Russia, Vasiliev stressed that Latvians and Russians have a completely different figure: "The participants of the Russian beauty competitions have more doubly breasts than the Latvian competitors."
However, Latvian young people are beautifully dressed and fried, and they can be proud of natural beauty, not of the marvels performed by plastic surgery.
I therefore particularly congratulate the participants in the Latvian beauty competition with their natural beauty.
In connection with its professional activity in Latvia, Vasiljev has great plans.
At present, a collection of fashion historians' exhibition "Reared Nature" is viewed at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
On the other hand, in Ventspil, in the castle of the Livonian Order, the exhibition of Vasiljeva "Caesar clothes 1860-2010".
Vasiliev loved Ventspils so much that he also enjoyed the hospitality of the city for a few days and walked along the sea.
I like Latvia very much.
It is especially now that there is a threat of terrorism across Europe, here is a real paradise.
"To spend time and rest in Latvia is a pure pleasure," the fashion guru acknowledged.
On 23 November, Alexander Vasilijev opened the Museum of Private Fashion.
Please help!
Please donate our son, our brother, for the treatment of the baby.
We, the Rinalda family, are grateful to the amazing people around us and to God that there was an opportunity to save Rinalda, but unfortunately, currently there is no way to fully cover the medical costs of his own forces.
Rinald Grinbergs is 11 years old and is diagnosed with brain tumors at the end of July.
This year he graduated from the 4th class at the University of Milzkalne with excellence, a powerful sportsman and a very talented artist.
He seems to have done everything for him.
A healthy, lively, unrelenting, diligent and active boy.
Always funny and nice.
On July 26, he will remain in our family for life.
During the last couple of weeks, I had trouble with headaches, but the doctors took it on the abdominal virus.
And at first it seemed that it did.
Because who could imagine that such "innocent" symptoms of guilt are much more serious than the thought incomprehensible.
On July 26, we received a diagnosis - Rinaldam is a brain tumor.
Fast storage fluid in the brain, but all that doctors can help in Latvia is to perform a surgical surgery to dispose of excess fluid, as direct surgery is practically not available.
It is also not possible to determine whether the farmer is benign or malicious.
Next national plan: start radiation and see what happens.
Like in a bad mood -- we're going to experiment here, we're going to look at the results.
Fortunately, Rinalda’s investigation resulted in an opportunity to show the doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice President of the World Neurosurgery Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgery.
He took the surgery, and it turned out to be surgery immediately.
The sower creates enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the farmer is benign or malicious in order to develop a plan for further treatment.
Not for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to save his son.
At a fantastic rate, on August 8, Rinald was in Spain with his mother, Evie, and on August 9, he was operated.
A very difficult, more than 6 hours long operation was performed.
The operation took place at Santa Elena's clinic.
The majority of the tumours were removed, reduced the pressure, obtained samples of analysis.
Rinald is already on his way from bed, and as a regular teenager, he asks for fri potatoes in the evening.
The results of oncology analyses should now be expected.
Thank you to Dr. Araez and the management of the clinic, who understood the situation and operated urgently without receiving a full fee for treatment prior to surgery.
They hoped that the remaining amount would be paid, only requested the first €10 000 contribution to operate and save Rinalda's life.
6 000 euros were made available to parents by selling machinery, but the other necessary amounts for travel, living, hospital first contribution was made to borrow from relatives and friends.
But at least EUR 24,000 is needed to calculate the first stage of treatment in Spain and to deliver the money that we have borrowed for the first contribution.
Please help us to repay this, Rinalda's health-related operation.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to enable Rinalda to continue its treatment successfully.
The signs of unrest in Ukraine raise the question: What about Vladimir Putin?
It has been decided on the truth of these claims.
Ukraine rejects them, while the US and the European Union argues that Russia has not provided any evidence.
An open-ended analysis group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday's interrogation, but it's not enough to delay Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for distorting events or for misinterpretations for political purposes, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Ukraine's opposition forces broke the electricity pillars that were supplying the Crimean Stream last year, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempt to attack in Crimea remains a topical issue, although there is little doubt that the Ukrainian government would sponsor the scenario of such events.
Whatever happens, the images found by the open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturdays - before the expected attack.
It shows how heavy weapons convoys move halfway across the coast, including missile systems for the protection of the coast.
Russia’s Famous Escalation
Some reports show that the Russian forces in Crimea had already been scheduled for a rotation that could help explain the activity, although it would be very much inconsistency that it was simply expected to take place at one of the most stressful times since the 2014 annex.
In order to make it known at the end of the week, Mr Putina has undoubtedly turned even further to Ukraine by choosing to use this episode to the extent that it is also realistic for a greater purpose.
Analysts point to disturbing parallels with how Russia dealt just before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar talks and military maneuvers provided a mandate for Crimean Volunteers to take part in a semi-sale that was still under Ukraine’s control, only to reveal that they were in fact the Russian special units that started the military occupation.
In August, when Russian-supported separatists did not take part in the Eastern Ukraine, Putin placed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed for the "protection" of the ethnic Russians in Ukraine, which he said was attacked.
He organised a convoy of aid to a region that, according to NATO, was only protected by the Russian invasion forces.
What is Mr Putina planning to do in Crimea?
Some reported that Moscow alone did not plan another military intervention.
The fight in Eastern Ukraine has intensified, just as it was before the attack in August 2014.
But this seemingly parallel could be the point where fear of military action, not of actual action, is to be introduced - it will be short for Putin in relations with both Ukraine and the Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, Professor of the University of New York, who is investigating Russia, pointed out that Crimea was of little importance as a point from which military action against Eastern Ukraine, which is bordering the Russian territory, rather than Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is a very small chance that the Russians are really planning a major offensive," Mr Galeotti said.
Rather, "we can observe a classic Russian strategy in creating pressure."
The international peace negotiations on Ukraine, which once was the mechanism with which Putin made contact with Western leaders who ignored him because of the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly considered to be ineffective and irrelevant.
Assuming that there is a threat that the conflict can be resolved again, Putin gives a new meaning to the negotiations: to get her put off the edge of the abyss.
"This is the standard Putina tactics - he wants to try to start from the force position," Galeoti said about the next peace talks scheduled at the beginning of September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted to, I could make it much more, much worse."
To reach agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the struggles in Crimea, it was not important to continue the negotiations by telling the other parties to convince them to return to the negotiating table and to come to the centre of the process.
What does that really give him?
First, it allows Russia to continue to be strengthened as a world power, even though its economies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having a veto right over Ukraine's sovereignty, to a certain extent maintaining the country under Russian control.
This can also benefit Putina's long-standing hopes for a broad-ranging agreement with the United States, which would resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, under favourable conditions, of course - also by ending Western sanctions against Russia.
A number of times since the deterioration in the state economic situation in 2014, well-known homes have been identified, mainly as a result of a decrease in the value of national oil and gas exports.
Since the attack in Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the Western authorities to join him in the great coalition of extremists.
However, the leaders of Russia may consider that they would need to ensure such an agreement before January, when President Obama's term of office expires.
The Russian officials believe that the next president will be Hilaria Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Trump, although he is considered friendly with Russia, is still considered unforeseeable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered to be one who "seeks solutions, not conflicts," Galeoti said.
So it is wise to close the window of opportunity to get something done quickly.
In the meantime, in the absence of a broad agreement, Putin seems satisfied with the preservation of Russia's weak neighbour by mentioning what will be further.
The earlier version of this article did not correctly state the year Russia invaded Crimea from Ukraine.
This took place in 2014, not in 2013.
When the convention came to a halt, the White House devoted funds to fighting Zika’s virus
Obama’s administration said Thursday that it would divert 81 million US dollars from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programmes to pay for a vaccine against Zika’s virus development because Congress did not approve new funding for the fight against the virus.
In a letter to the participants of the Congress, Silvija Metjus Barvela, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, pointed out that without the funds being channelled, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical Research and Development Authority would remain free of money to fight the disease of leather transmitted by the end of the month.
Therefore, the development of the vaccine should be stopped at an important time, as Maiami increases the number of cases of Zikas disease in the country.
Last week, 7,350 Zikas virus cases were reported in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to the control and prevention centre data).
Ms. Barbelas said that 15 babies were born with Zika virus-related birth defects.
The virus may cause brain development abnormalities and other serious defects in the unborn child.
The spread of the disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has raised the political rates for the federal government's response.
On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton stopped in Vienna, Miami, where there was a local outbreak of Zika's virus, and pressured Congress to return from its five-week break to confirm emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republics of Congress have been controversial in most of the year's Zika virus issues.
In February Obama requested $1.9 billion for emergency funding.
The Republics stopped it by requesting a more detailed report on the use of the money.
The legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
In the last month, the Democrats blocked the review of the proposed measure by the Republicans when US$ 1.1 billion was allocated to the fight against Zika's virus, but included conditions prohibiting the allocation of funds to family planning for the provision of contraceptives in connection with a virus that could be so transferred to the family.
The White House in April was forced to spend $589 million on fighting Ebola virus, fighting Zika virus. About two thirds of funding is intended to be used inside the country.
Ms. Barvela said on Thursday that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The failure to take a decision on emergency funding for the fight against Zika virus has led the administration to choose between the suspension of the work of the important vaccine development and the disposal of other valuable national programmes in order to avoid this suspension in a timely manner," Barvela wrote.
The Democrats agreed with this Communication to transfer to the Republicans the non-proportion of additional money to the fight against Zika virus.
At the news conference, the representative of Nensija Pelosi from California, a minority leader, asked the representative of Poland D.Raien, the Speakers of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the continuation of this event.
"All possibilities are exhausted, and now we are turning to the National Institute of Health," said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr. Raine's advisors say that the transfer of funds is a step that had to be stopped a long time ago and which Obama's administration has withdrawn in order to express the maximum political benefit of Zika's virus problem.
Last week, the National Institute of Health announced that it had started clinical trials against Zika virus in 80 people and hoped to start the second phase of Zika virus epidemic countries in early 2017.
However, as officials said on Thursday, without immediate additional funding, the study will be stopped.
Barvela said that she would target 34 million US dollars from the National Health Service for the fight against Zika virus, including cancer and diabetes.
Another 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of medicines and vaccines in response to emergencies in the field of public health.
This money will come from several accounts, including 19 million US dollars from a programme that grants small-scale subsidies to small-scale families, and 4 million US dollars from drug dependence programmes, such as opioid dependence.
Even as Barvel said, additional money will only be sufficient for the next month, when the agencies come to "reasonably narrow up their activities" in the fight against Zika's virus if the Congress does not act.
Over the last four months, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has spent 60 million US dollars to help the states protect pregnant women, 25 million US dollars to strengthen their preparedness for Zika's virus and plans to fight it, and 16 million US dollars to help it establish data recovery systems to quickly detect microcephalus and other symptoms associated with Zika's virus.
The Thai leader links attacks to the favorite sites of tourists with constitutional changes
The leader of the Thai Hontas called on the public to be patient on Friday until the investigators found out that a series of deadly bomb explosions took place in Thailand this week.
General Prajuts Çan-oča, Honta's leader and Prime Minister, said that criminals have been "bad people", protesting against the new Constitution approved by the voters in the referendum on Sunday.
"There are still bad people, and they worked before the referendum," he said to the people.
The bomb blasts in five provinces were killed on Thursday and Friday, including Phuket and Huahin, in the sight of tourists, four and two people were killed.
The authorities of the country of origin shall declare that the attacks of the firefighters are linked elsewhere.
Analysts claim that the bomb explosions were not intended to kill many people, but to harm the tourism sector, one of the bright points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"Whatever the motive, explosions and attacks by the firefighters are surrounding the hunta's claim that the post-reference situation will be stable," said Sunajs Fasuks, the senior researcher in the Human Rights Watch.
These attacks result in discrediting the authorities, terrorising the public and harming the tourism-based economy.
Photo of Thailand rescue services are providing a bomb blast in Huahin on Friday.
The police claim that in their view these explosions are not related to international terrorism or prolonged Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They consider attacks on "local sabotage", not terrorism.
A strong political symbol for the time and location of the attack.
The event took place on Friday, when people were prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Siricita, which is considered Mother’s Day in Thailand.
Four explosions took place in the royal residence of Huahin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where there were also most injured.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of the political parties and grant the military greater powers even if the government is again in control of civilians.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory without allowing opponents to campaign against it.
Mureis Hübert, South-East Asia expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, pointed out military suspects that the attacks had been carried out by people who were not satisfied with the vote.
The signs were "precisely coordinated, but the eyes are clearly aimed at creating fear and confusion, not mass damage and damage and injuries," he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed in an explosion at the popular Erevan shrine in Bangkok.
The Thai officials linked the explosions with Uighur fighters who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uighur to China.
General Preijuts, who has been in charge together since 2014, when the business was abandoned by the civilian government, said that this week's explosions "pain the heart of the Tayemais."
Why now, when the country is getting better, when the economy is getting better and the tourism sector is getting better?" he said.
We have to ask why and who did it.
Gold reaction: as seen by Simone Manuele's historic moment
This evening when I started fighting, I was trying to remove the weight of the black community from my shoulders, which is something that I am not with me simply in such a position.
However, I hope that will all be gone.
I am more than happy that I am able to serve others as an inspiration and, hopefully, by different forms of sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to be the day when we have more, and it is not Simone, a black swimmer, because the term of the black swimmer makes it look like I should not be able to beat the gold medal or that I should not be able to skip records.
It's not because I'm working as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and I want to win like everyone else.
The fight for students - Lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (L.G.B.T.) - defence in Colombia
Two years ago the 16-year-old Sergio Urrego moved away from the shopping center in Bogotá, before leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, quoting Pink Floyd's song "Goodbye Cruel World" ("The Wicked World").
Her death was the beginning of a conflict in Colombia this week, where efforts to extend the right of L.G.B.T. were seen in the broader political struggles that divided the country into two camps.
After his death, the mother of Uruguay, Alba Reijes, filed a complaint against the officials of the school, blaming them for the exclusion of her only son when it was found that he and his class had intimate relations.
A year later, the Colombian Supreme Court issued a favourable judgment calling for schools across the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories for the gay rights movement in Colombia. Some time earlier this year, the movement celebrated the decision to legalize marriage.
However, this week they faced a barrier in their struggle for equality, because the minister of education, who is openly gay, became a scandal about the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when social media began to circulate sexually exposed content from the porn magazine, spreading talks that it was part of the textbook issued by the Ministry of Education.
Perody's doing this.
Although the Ministry offered help to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with a view to helping them focus on the rule, it did not try to impose the standard rules.
"What we want for schools is tools to solve conflicts," Mrs Perdodia said in a Thursday interview.
The debate began before the national debate on the future of the country, where peace negotiations between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or FARC, will be fought by a group of partisans.
The political coalition and the leaders of the Catholic Church in opposition to the government have been extremely quickly mobilized, accusing President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting one sex union and gender change.
In order to make it even more difficult for everyone, a government delegation participating in the negotiations with FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and the equality of L.G.B.T., calling on the government to adopt a more inclusive policy.
The government's criticism and peace negotiations, which have attracted 42-year-old Perody, Colombia's leading star.
They showed a number of posters at the meetings and some have also threatened to resort to violence against them and their partners, Cecilia Alvaresa-Correa Glen, former trade ministers.
Perodya kept a wonderful peace throughout the week, trying to correct the error and restart the debate with constructive conditions.
"In part, what makes me stand and keep a clear head is the awareness that there are children who will only be discovered," she said.
This is a very tight field of work and a very simple time.
She also pointed out the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Columbians continue to assess the benefits of a transaction with FARC, which would be a turning point for the country as an earthquake, they have to consider the rise of the conflict, she said.
"Is there a state of peace that promotes inclusion or exclusion; or is it where everyone has equal opportunities?" she asked.
Even though this week she was not pleased to be the target of insults and relocations, she is pleased that today's gay students in Colombia can take an example from her and think that they can also one day try to become ministers.
"I am very important that they are calm and realize that they can fully realize their potential," said Mrs. Perody.
We can't wait for a new suicide to start something change.
Do you want to save your vote in cybersecurity - The New York Times
"ASV is looking for ways to keep hackers per piece from election urns" (news article, August 4)
Minister of Internal Security, J. Johnson, says the Obama administration is thinking of additional protection of the security of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
In the various manifestations and recent revelation that foreign forces may be national countries are increasingly interested in the influence of our elections, demands that the federal government pay further attention to the provision of our electoral system and perhaps consider it a part of our country's essential infrastructure.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that assist in the election and offer assistance, consultation and management of the Department of Homeland Security.
As long as the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure prevents efforts to ensure it, it tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.

A boy injured in a carousel in Pennsylvania, this week the third case of attracting parks
On Thursday, after a car accident, a boy was taken to Pittsburgh Hospital. The Rapid Assistance Service and Park Officers say this is already the third incident this week in the U.S. Attractive Parks, where children suffered.
A child whose name is not found was only taken to a children’s hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 km) west of Aidvailda and Soukzona’s attraction park in Lajjonjer, Pennsylvania, said a quick assistance representative of the Westmürland area.
The three-year-old boy, who visited with his brother while he was being helped on the spot, was aware of the e-mailed by the park representative Jeff Krushors.
Krušor said the attraction "Rollo Coaster" will be closed for the investigation period.
Children in Aidvaild should be at least 3 feet (91 cm) long in order to be able to visit the carousel, and those who are less than 4 feet (122 cm) should be accompanied by adults.
The deduction, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938, and the Department of Agriculture indicated that it was examined in August.
The hospital representative refused to comment on the condition of the boy.
On Sunday of the neck injury that will come from the world’s highest water mountain in Kansas, Kansas, a ten - year - old boy died.
On Monday, three 6, 10 and 16-year-old girls who fell from over 30 feet (9 m) above the height of the hospital were sent to the hospital to report to local media in Greenville, Tennessee, on a panoramic shift during the annual market.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe World War II will not visit a shrine that honors the memory of the war: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that Prime Minister of Japan, Sindho Abe, will not visit the Holy See of Tokyo during World War II, which honors the memory of the war.
Thursday, however, you reported that Abe planned on Monday to send a ritual gift to Jasukuni for the anniversary.
The sanctuary also honors 14 Japanese caravans, who are only convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it a symbol of Japanese Kingdom militaryism.
Both have not visited the shrine since December 2013, when he announced that he has visited to show respect for those who love his birth.
The new Japanese Defence Minister Tomomi Inada has not answered the question of whether she will visit the sanctuary, explaining that it is a matter of conscience.
Inada - near Abe society and Japan's pacifist constitutional amendment advocate - visited Jasukuni regularly in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that on Thursday, Masahiro Imamura, the minister of reconstruction of the territories affected by the Japanese disaster visited the sanctuary and said he was praying for the peace and prosperity of Japan.
Relations between China and Japan, Asia's two largest economies, have become more difficult after the increasing presence of China's coastal guards and other country ships near the Mediterranean islands, which are known in Japan as Senkaku, but in China as Diaudzu.
Arrested two suspects in the planning of the terrorist acts of Rio Olympics: police
On Thursday, the police arrested two people suspected of supporting the Islamic State group in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Prior to Thursday, the police had already detained 12 people, all suspected of cooperation with the Islamic state fighters.
The Brazilian Federal Police report that three more people were understood and then released.
The two prisoners are Brazilians on Thursday, but the police do not reveal their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts in the history of Brazil with known groups of fighters, the government reports that the Olympics have made the country a more up-to-date goal, in particular because of the participation of the countries fighting the Islamic state.
Its fighters are controlled by individual Iraqi and Syrian territories, and the US-led coalition has carried out air attacks on them.
The group has supporters all over the world, who have been questioning and harassing civilians.
Official charges against the murder of the newly suspected French priest
In the course of the French priest's murder investigation against the man arrested on the previous day, official charges were filed, and on Friday Reuters reported a source of information to the police.
A 21-year-old suspect is being investigated in cooperation with terrorists, and he has been planning attacks on people, the source of information said.
The man was contacted by telephone with Adele Kermis and Abdeu Malik Petitdjan, who stopped the church service in Sentetjên du Ruve, West France, on July 26, and turned the weapon over to Father James Amell, an 85 - year - old Catholic teacher.
Both the police are dying.
The suspect had left his home not far from Tuluza, on the Senate of Ruva and spent the night there before the attack, mentioned the source.
The young man, who had not previously been convicted, admitted that he spent the night there, but told the investigator that he was away the next day because he did not have a good relationship with Kermic and Petitdjan, said a source of information.
The investigators are trying to determine whether Kermic and Petitdžan were participants in France and whether they were related to the Islamic State that has assumed responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, a pretrial detention was applied to the Brother Pettjanna.
Doruss de Vriess before transferring to Celtic
Nottingham Forest Club Guard Doruss de Vriess arrived in Glázgov, hoping to conclude an agreement on a transfer to Celtic.
De Vriess was photographed, entering Roshol's hospital before medical examination after Hope agreed on conditions with the Sky Bet Champions Club.
Parkhead Club leader Brendan Rodgers is looking for an experienced centre guard to compete for Craig Gordon's current first number.
Tomert Rogers trusts the old de Vries because he worked with the Dutch team at the Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which they played under Rogers’ leadership in 2011 and won the privilege of moving to Premejerly.
He has been changing the form of welcome to join the "Vilkis", and has been City Ground since 2013.
During his career, he also played in Scotland after the Diumvergline season, after moving back in 2006.
His stay in Istandbar ended with a convulsions, however, Pars experienced a double agony, being "sended in triumph" from the highest level, before the loss in Celtic Scotland's cup.
The guard under the contract had still remained a year in the Forest composition, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's gonna close 100 stores.
The wholesale giant Macy's announced on Thursday its plans to close 100 shops, which is a dramatic step towards helping the shop chain to get ahead of the potentially syllable problem: In America, it claims, there is too much online shopping for the era.
Macy's regularly reduces its shop portfolio, often closing several dozens of insufficiently profitable shops immediately after the annual holiday harvest.
However, following its summer announcement that it would close 15 per cent of its 728 trading venues, shops chains appear to have received much more aggressive positions than many of the like-minded representatives of the retail sector in terms of reducing its turnover by adapting to a very variable procurement environment.
Hikers and buyers go long to Macy's shop in New York.
The retail giant announces that it plans to close 100 shops.
Macy's has a lot of reasons to try to change: many of its shops are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has particularly affected the flow of e-commerce.
The wholesale category has generally been more difficult because buyers are increasingly choosing lower-price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion workers such as H&M.
These factors, due to such short-term difficulties as increasingly less international tourists spending and seasonally inadequate weather conditions that Macy's have put in a unstable situation that has been straining for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales volumes in the last quarter had fallen by 2.6 per cent, with a weak improvement, however, taking into account the very bad 6,1 per cent decrease in the annual cut found in the previous quarter.
The retail income was US$ 5.87 billion (US$ 7.64 billion), which is 3.9 per cent less than it was in this period.
Macy's said that closing the shops would cost about 1 billion US dollars a year.
And the closure of such a large number of shops could at the same time be considered a recognition of the retailer’s collapse.
However, the company’s share value fell by 17 percent on Thursday, which shows that investors view this move as a proactive measure that describes Macy’s stronger future.
In itself, Macy's reducing the number of shops should not be surprising.
The retailer's Director General Terijs Lundgren has already said that the chain is simply too much store.
At some point, senior managers said that they had adopted a new strategy, with a special focus on 150 of its most profitable shops, in an effort to achieve higher sales volumes in the already profitable trading venues.
Jeffs Jenette, director of Macy's, who has been appointed at Lundgren's place since 2017, said in his statement that almost all of the shops that the company plans to close are where sales volumes and profitability slide down.
"We are aware that in these trading venues we still do not receive adequate return on investments and often there is no level of buyers' shopping experience that reflects our efforts in connection with Macy's brand," said Janet.
The company announced that it would submit a list of shops to be closed at a later date.
Macy's said that still being decided on closed shops and that is why it is not yet clear how many employees will be fired.
The retailer does not completely deviate from the main markets where he currently owns shops, but this concerns closing shops in less active places.
This move will most likely not be for the managers of shopping malls, which will count on large tenants such as Macy's to attract and maintain their shopping malls.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, drinking from a refilled bottle can be "a lot worse than dropping your dog’s toy", given how many bacteria are going to be affected.
The website Treadmill Reviews asked EmLab P&K to check 12 four different types of water bottles - with a screwing hook, with a flip-off hook, with a push-in hook, and with a straw.
Each bottle was used by a sportsman for a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle may be as dirty as the dog’s toys.
"On the basis of 12 of our tested water bottles, we found that the reusable drinks can contain a large number of viable bacteria: more than 300,000 colonies per square centimeter (CVV/kv.cm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
Bottles with release caps detected a maximum quantity of microbes, more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CVV/kv.cm.)
The bottles contained microbes that may cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood clots.
Bottles with pressed corks were the next worst with 162 000 KVV/vv.cm., while the screws with screws contained only a little less than 160,000 KVV/v.cm.
"Drink water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet dish," is indicated on the website.
A much better picture is observed in the case of straw bottles where only part of the bacteria in the other bottles was found - only 25 KVV/kv.cm.
This could be because the water is full of up to the lower part of the salmon, not adjacent to its edges, thus attracting moisturizing microbes.
Bottles containing the lead are described as "mostly safe."
"On the basis of the results of our test, we recommend choosing a bottle with both the number of small bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes," said the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles with no gaps and difficult cleaning sites will be less microbial.
On the website, readers are advised to wash bottles after each use, ideally with a weak cleaning solution.
Religion needs to be modern or forgotten
The U.S. Democratic Party recently nominated Hilaria Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the last polls are really the same, the Americas will innovate their first president - a woman in January.
In the preceding week, over the ocean, British Prime Minister Terez Meja discussed Britain's withdrawal from the European rules with German Chancellor Angelo Merkel.
Women raised in Western society have been raised to know that by means of education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity.
And today, new girls can target a number of existing role models in the field of higher leadership.
So is the fight for equality finally over?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become president of the United States at any time, but women's leadership in the field of religion remains a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership remains a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women were to be adopted in a diacon order in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church welcomed Libya Lein as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a unsuccessful attempt in 2012.
While women's rabbinic movements have been ordered in the Jewish movement since the early 1970s and the conservative movement since the early 1980s, the concept of rabbinic women's rabbinic in orthodox Judaism still has a very strong resistance.
In November 2015, the American Orthodoxal rabbinic Council published a sad news that the concept of female rabbinic is contrary to the law, in its third attempt to stop the growing wave of support for the proper ordering of women in rabbinic order.
Not without irony, when Hillary Clinton was appointed as the candidate for the presidency of the Democrats, the group of the American leader of the correct rabbin, who objected to women's order, started a series of "debate" on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between time and time?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be a lasting traditional value.
This shows the ability to resist pressure to adapt to changing society.
Those who oppose women's order do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."
However, taking over with the preservation of traditions is such a price.
And such a unilateral thought price can paradoxly contribute to the tradition of itself by removing the traditional community oxygen that it needs to maintain life.
In the book "August Firearms", in World War I military history, Barbara Taczmena stresses the danger of giving priority to the tradition of what has become known as the "red bull tragedy."
By the beginning of World War I, war had taken its way from the close of battle to the heavier artillery that is being spread from the farther, and it was profitable to hide the soldiers as long as possible.
The British and German armies reacted to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms with the long - standing walls and browns.
However, the French soldiers still wore the same red hats and trousers that made them easy to reach.
The proposal by French War Minister Adolph Mesimius that the armies under his command could act in a similar manner was perceived with ridicule and opposition.
The red whips reflected the military's pride and prestige, and the military traditionalists were not ready to give it up.
Speaking in parliament, former Minister for War Affairs Eigen Etienne spoke on behalf of France.
"Refuse the red pants?" he exclaimed.
Sometimes!
"There was an inexplicable and idiotic annex to the most visible of all colors," he later wrote in Messim, "that there should have been bad consequences."
Leaders of faith who are fighting for the inclusion of women in the leading religious roles could enter the same ranks.
Focusing only on the "traditional" religion, rather than asking the important question: "What changes are necessary for religion to flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the whole community of talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
Introducing men to continue wearing bikes when it comes to religion can be traditional, but, as the red bikes ’ funeral shows, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is the founder of JOFA (Women's Orthodox Feminist Association) in Great Britain and student of orthodox rabbinism in Jeshivat Maharat in New York.
The children of the province of Rojas gained new skills in the camp.
From 1 to 6 August, Rojupe's children and young people took place in the centre of the "Varawiknes Bridges" camp, during which participants were creatively manifested, sported, and gained new skills.
We arrived in Nomatna on the day of the closing day when the children were very excited about the glares of glass.
Younger Māra Folkmane told Rojupe's child and youth initiative specialist that this was one of the activities that the participants liked most.
It was also a great pleasure to visit the "Mazbebriņi" table of Einar Kalniņa.
Most children liked lasergravier because it was possible to see the picture on the computer being gradually placed on the child.
E. Kalniņš has told us what subjects should be taught in school if he wants to work on the table, that is, the main thing is mathematics, in particular geometry, computer science, and technical drawing and drawing.
He also stressed the need to work more with brains than with muscles in this profession.
In a small shop there are individual orders, and it is important first to plan everything.
To get to know others better, at the start of the camp, participants participated in various games, as well as jointly formed camps "herbs".
On Wednesday, crossing the sea from Paradise to Zocene, natural materials were collected that were later used to make maps.
Sports games that are particularly important to participants were also wanted.
We went to a multi-dwelling house where we had a sport and recreation area, playing football and a network ball.
Children like sports activities, we have lots of kids playing football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sportsy.
Girls like more peaceful jobs.
On the next day, with the help of self-contained mass, decorative burskins, which can be used later as seal holders.
It was also a talent evening, and the children chose to stand together, and one evening they were assigned to the front.
Table games were also played, each one could show his knowledge at the time of the photo orientation, where objects were to be found and photographed after the billets.
The task was to meet differently in each picture.
We also dyed mandalas - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one role that will be enjoyed by everyone - one that is closer to sport, another that is creative.
"Now it seems that everyone is doing an interesting job of glazing glass," said Mr. Folkman.
In conclusion, diplomas were issued on creativity, sport and assistance - several children helped directly in economic work.
The name "Varaviksknese bridge" was created because children from three associations - Rojupes and the Youth and Children's Initiative Centre, as well as the "Strops" multifunctional centre of the province of Rojas.
They're such agreeing bridges.
If parents think of something more quickly, we borrow ideas; if they do, they borrow from us.
We share experience.
This year, 30 participants were involved in the camp - children who were active during the year.
"We had planned that there would be 30, and so did it," says Mr. Folkman.
It's been five years.
It began in 2010 when the Social Service of the Rojas Municipality decided that a camp should be organised in summer for multi-child families and for children with disabilities.
However, the situation in Roje has improved since now, and the camp is now intended for the inhabitants of the municipality, who come and work in youth centres.
The goal is to spend a lot of time on it.
There were two camps in the past, with 20 children participating in each of them, while only one camp is being held in general because of the country’s decline in the number of children.
Similar activities take place over the next year.
The children drew a glass of glass, came to the villages of Einars Kalniņš, who taught wood burning, machine making from wood, with figurines in various forms.
There is also a new technique - encaustics, it is coloring with hot wax cream.
Under Ilze Shelkov’s leadership, the teacher was involved in the production of polymer material, and we made balloons and various puzzles.
We make paintings of natural materials, interesting mandalas of bees, bees, linseeds, autumn leaves.
We're trying to use what's around us.
The youth centre works from 3 to 20.00 in winter, and in summer - from 14 to 20.00 in winter.
"The youth centre in Rudje visits 15 children per day on average," said Mr. Folkmane.
She emphasises that great support is provided by the council of the Municipality of Rojas, which understands the need to give money to children because they form our future.
Charlton Athletic fan "may have a season ticket only if he signs a behavioural contract" and agrees not to criticise the club's social media.
Although we recognize that everyone has the right to his own personal opinion, the publication of pulsating comments on such websites is not beneficial.
A fan working in the field of administration was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from former senior police inspector Clif Iger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career police force.
In the following letters: "I must inform you that the award of the season ticket will be renewed on condition that you sign the "Acoordinated Conduct Agreement" (ABC), which will provide that you will continue to refrain from publishing negative or dissuasive comments about clubs or clubs to people representing all kinds of social media websites or any other behaviour that might be considered antisocial."
Speaking to Daily Telegraph, the fans described how he called the club after the season ticket fee, which was not received either, and two days later a letter was received by mail.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said, "They told me that I was too much "twisted," telling others who are funny."
Cycling holidays on the coasts of Dalmatia
What do you mean, "sin"?
I am going here from all power," said Colina, former U.S. Marine Commander, who had just taken off a 25-year-old wheel ride along some uneven central part of the Croatian island, leaving nothing there, except a mixed expression of sweat and wooly sailors scattered in hostile mountains.
Some riders sing hymns or number of children’s garden flowers to make it easier for them to be on the mountain.
Colin's friend Petiya recommends "The Little Engine That Could".
Others have a number of holes or simply suffer in silence, thinking about what it requires to get to a transmony similar to what the wheeled riders are talking about.
Colina's going down faster than she's going down in a variety of ways.
To drive some gardens to her in the future is like the back of Hugh Greens as a film at the beginning of the "Four Weddings and One Bears".
Her and my mission is a week-long "luxury" yacht and cycling along the coast and islands of the North Dalmatian Croatia organised by Freedom Treks.
Walking in summer heat at a mountain spot such as Croatia may not be consistent with every sense of horror, but speaking that the North Dalmatian is easier to drive than the South Dalmatian, our sails are soft, and when we filled the booking forms, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a window that we didn't notice that could have provided us with the battery with a loaded e-velosiped.
The luxury part of the deal is our floating house for a week, the brand new Melody.
At the end of the trip, we can combine our bicycles in battle with our guides Ivan and Ivan and the ship's back to the blue water, without contacting seaweeds, ash stones and other people on the narrow stone strips that the Croatians call the beach.
In June the water temperature in the sea is perfect, all agree: it will be cold enough to cool, but not cold.
On Melody there are masks and breathing tubes and some kayaks, if any feel energetic after a heavy morning on the sails.
Instead, most of us come back to our cabins with air conditioners where Helen, the ship's massier - I'm not kidding - will have already put on our beds, added our mini-labour stocks and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that climbing after cycling is very important, and we are learning to jump on our beds or with the sunglasses on the upper deck with the bartender Antonio, who is always ready to prepare one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half-carved crews, not a released superjacket, but a stylish little cruise ship.
It turns against a small island port between fishing vessels and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Colina and Petija belong to the metup.com group of friends from Washington, Colombia: sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s grandiose and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something more rewarding, and so they are in Croatia.
The competing chapel from their church is on a boat and bicycle holiday in Provans, and every afternoon the air collapses the competing Facebook publication pingpong rail.
The element of holiday experiences can be over-reached because our schedule is nothing unless a specific regime is established.
"The lunch and dinner are in eight," Ivan told the new participants at the opening meeting when we started our way from the beautiful old Trogir port, which is near Split.
One ship’s call indicates that the buffet is open, while the other at the end of the meal invites you to listen quietly and listen carefully to the further information.
"Good!" is the cultural context, which may have been lost everywhere, but not in the British contingent.
A difference - the fun has already taken the turn, jokes are coming out of the race, while Ivana issues the day's excursion card, but we all seem to be afraid of snooping, exploding contours and profiles with increases and falls, even though any other would be a surprise on the Croatian road that starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," said Ivan.
The full balance is not recommended.
Ivan conducts an information meeting in parallel by freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different peoples, but we are a simple group - Swiss, German, American and British, who sit easily at the tables where two speak English but one at the same time in German.
On the way, we're all friends.
Driving promotes society, and only competition is within itself, respectively.
I do not recall when the dynamics of the group would have been more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we're looking at Ivan's wave.
A small increase is a slope that should not be mixed with inequality, which is a good thing.
Matatas are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same: "Take one by one, delay the distance, and they are no competition.
Stay on the coast of nine.
All right, five couples - I'll remember you're on vacation.
Take plenty of water.
From Trogira we will take a two-day cruise north through the Kornati archipelago, where we will go almost all along Dugi Otok - in the Croatian language "garo island" - and after a short walk through the natural park of Telašcica, surprised by its cliffs and salt lakes, where seawater flows through the underground channel.
It says that those who earn it by virtue of it become younger.
If we do, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
In the small island of Molata, we return to the south, moving from the continent to the nearby islands apparently by chance.
Most of our journey is on empty small roads outside the country with wide views of the sea and a variety of plants: olive groves, wine gardens, ash plant brigades, Mediterranean smells in the air and countless thorns in flight.
We go forward, there's always a moment, but then when Ivan stops, there's always a big shadow, and small mice are like a prize for those who have arrived faster.
Sports and public activists go a lot to the end of the week, and they know the rules of conduct by sending warnings in a row and leaving free places so that motorists can carry out fire drills much more safely.
"You're almost hit," said one driver to another after the heavy car driver decided to take the ignition manoeuvre on an invisible curve and quickly stopped.
Fortunately, the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups each by a few short steps to travel on the main roads, with Ivan himself in the back to provide and "give the tempo", as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we will all gather, get off the bikes and safety after the ride with our bicycles on the other side as we were instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan knows he's not talking to a group of kids?" asks the Swiss wheelman, when we stand on the side of the road and wait for a signal when we can cross it.
We can't spend all afternoons on vacation.
In the city view, a Roman forum and sea eagles are discovered in Zadar, playing music that tastes like a sea monster’s oar, through stone-based pipes in the promenade and open water.
Zadar's famous sunflower perfectly falls between the main meal and the bottle, and after dark entry we return to the sea eagles and see the wave-operated lights game in the glass sidewalk, which is actually the dance floor.
When "Melody" early in the morning starts the way to the giant Biograd resort, the cheerleader's song is nothing more than just a smell.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from the wheeling.
The trip to the eastern part of the river Krka to view its waterfalls; then the afternoon tour in Sibenik, where we look at the thought cathedral, the masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as the steps of the chair on the peaceful Zlarin Island, looking for its local precious coral, makes this day interesting.
Lurda is about to take the St. John's in the shadow of the attack.
During the annual Catholic celebration, people gather at the Shrine of the Lord.
The French security forces are on high alert because thousands of Catholics gather at the annual celebration of the Lord’s Church in the shadow of several acts of terror.
On August 15, each year tens of thousands of people gather at the Pyrenees ’ Hill to observe the arrival of the new Mary in heaven.
This year’s celebration takes place at a time when Catholics were shocked by the killing of an older French priest on July 26, by two Islamic extremists who attacked the church in the north of France during a mission and turned his arm over to him.
Zaka Amela's obscurity took place two weeks after a Tunisian man -- the investigators claim that he was radicalized by the online video of the jihadist -- he broke up with a load car at the Bastille Day party in the city of Nicaea, killing 85 people.
After three large attacks in 18 months, many French citizens are cautious about visiting public events.
The number of tourists declined dramatically, and the authorities insisted that the number of visitors this year could fall quickly.
However, fear of mass withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organizers say that even the inflow of visitors' applications has been observed recently.
Approximately 25,000 faithful arrivals are expected, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and about 200 members of the Eastern Christian community - the correct delegation of representatives.
Many pilgrims have announced that they have not allowed themselves to be stumbled.
"We do not intend to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Christian said to the agency AFP, describing prayer as "the only weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life will continue," said Matey Guinars - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
As a result of the concerns about the security in France since the attack in Nice, a number of large measures have been lifted, including a huge drop in the northern market in Lille and the European Championship on cycling through the cheese that was due to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in one call to call for applications," said Fabjen in Legesne, a priest responsible for the official celebration last weekend.
"On the other hand, it seems that the attacks have mobilized the believers," he said and announced the influx of last minute's applications.
The head of the trade union of local hotel staff, Christian Ziel, confirmed the "high interest" of the holiday after the attacks.
In 1858, the site where the young Mary appeared to the poor sheep of Bernadette Subirū was a place of extreme security.
About 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been appointed to protect the site, including bomb neutralisation experts and experts with explosives search dogs.
In addition, the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three at the entrance point of the safety barrier.
Katrina Simkoxa, who took a trip from northeastern England to Lord in the beginning of this month, described the enhanced security measures.
"By the morning of Thursday morning there were armed guards in the temples, and then through the gates (with metal barriers) could only enter one by one, and the sums were searched," she said The Local.
"This all made up for my three children who have gone to Lurda, and it was difficult for them not to avoid them when they asked why it was happening," she said.
It didn’t hurt my impressions, but it made me sad that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were calming down.
The opening process of Friday is also shortened - instead of starting in the city of Lurda and moving further to the temple, it will start and end in the temple.
Other measures include the closure of the airspace for flights over Lurda, the closure of the streets in the vicinity of the hall and the replacement of the waste urns against transparent plastic bags.
French Interior Minister Bernars Kazeneev will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people go to Lurdu each year, making it one of the world’s largest Catholic pilgrimage destinations.
Many visitors lead relatives who are sick or with disabilities and who come to swim in the well where Bernadette has seen Mary, subject to water medical properties.
There Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's meeting as "a bit unusual", taking into account "the threat as root seems to be being sought in France."
However, he argued that this would not affect the quality and depth of his experience.
French, 58-year-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that in her opinion, the presence of soldiers dressed in civil war was "a bit overwhelming."
However, if it all calms down, it's good.

The discovery of the season for aquatic honeybees is imminent.
Each year, on the second Saturday of August, the season for water-bird hunting is opened.
This year it will begin at 16:00 p.m. on 13 a.m., so the State police call on both hunters and citizens to be particularly careful and to comply with security rules.
Water bird hunting takes place not only in hunting areas but also in public waters, and although weather conditions do not change for the next few years, it is also permitted to be used by vacationers along with hunters.
Both the fishermen and the restoratives and those living in the watercourses call for special caution in the vicinity of the lakes and rivers and for compliance with safety rules, without endangering themselves or others.
As it has been observed in previous years that a large number of hunters are involved in the first days of the opening of the season, this year, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will also have increased control of hunting.
Legislative officers will draw attention to the compliance of arms and ammunition with the rules of the law and will monitor the conduct of hunting without the effects of alcoholic beverages and aprivileged substances.
The police recall that water birds are prohibited from using semi-automatic firearms with a total capacity of more than three cartridges, including the amendment of the Arms and Special Means Act, in particular section 22 (91), which states that persons with large-scale firearms or large-energy pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sport, and during the short stop period of two hours when these weapons are transported to or from hunting, have the right to keep weapons and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but they must be placed as safely as possible in order to ensure that the furtral or other equipment in which the ammunition or weapons are placed, do not show off the vehicles during the pursuit of the road, to the roadside and to the roadside and to the roadway.
The police are calling for the security of their own and fellow humans during the season and, if you consider violations of law or any threat to security, we are asking to report immediately by telephone 110.
In any event, the legislators are prepared to respond to the information provided by the citizens.
New Caledonian coasts satricin 7.2 magnetite earthquake
New Caledonian coasts have damaged 7.2 magnitude earthquake on Friday, reported seismology, indicating that there is no tsunami threat.
The Earthquake epicenter was located nine kilometres deep 109 kilometers east of New Caledonia at 1.26 p.m. after the Green Age (see 4.26 p.m. in Latvia), the U.S. Geology Research Centre announced.
In the Pacific Ocean, the tsunami alarm centre indicated that there is no warning or recommendation at this time in relation to possible tsunami threats to the region.
"The earthquakes in this region, as it is known, are not undetected, nor are they undetected in the last period of activity," said the senior seismologist Fils Kaminss of the research centre Geoscience Australia.
Potentially, it could be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonian islands, but I doubt it is so powerful to make excuses.
New Caledonia is located in the "Fire Circle" - the Pacific Ocean in the tectonic activity area, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree on the opening of the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open checkpoints at the borders of both countries, which were closed on Thursday after the Venezuelan initiative, told Presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro.
The initial border points will only be open to passengers.
Starting on Saturday, five border points will be opened every day from 8 to 20 hours.
The President pointed out that it would be possible to open the borders to transport once individual cross-border agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded.
Maduro was forced to close the border in August in response to the attack by the Colombian soldiers on the Venezuela border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in this attack.
In July this year, the Venezuelan unilaterally opened the border twice because of the economic crisis in the axles - the Venetians who came to poverty tried to cross the border to buy the first necessary goods at the border stores.
This was used by 200,000 Venezuelan citizens.

"Facebook" applies to combat-advertising blockers.
The most widely used social network in the world Facebook has spread a warning like this, making it clear that blocking advertising banners using special tools is not acceptable and that users will also have to look at advertisements.
The popularity of special advertising blockers is growing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is directly advertising are falling.
Facebook has now made it known that it is good to understand the harmful nature of advertising banners, but users will also have to live with them.
The truth is, they will be provided with tools to choose for themselves what kind of material they are shown, the BBC reports.
"As we provide people with more and more control options, we will also start to show advertisements to those who use advertising blocking software," Facebook advertising vice president Andrew Boswarts said.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of advertising they see by selecting brands and sectors that they think are interesting.
"People don't like to see advertisements that don't apply to them or interfere with the enjoyment of content," Boswart said.
Advertising blocking tools in mobile devices usually do not work, from which Facebook receives the biggest visit, but the reduction of banner exposure generated by them is also measured in billion terms.
According to BBC information, advertising blockers are used by about 200 million people.
It has already been reported that in the previous quarter of the business Facebook revenue from the advertising was 6.2 billion US dollars or 5.55 billion euros.
It should be noted that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their news streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just begun to act to remove or at least limit new streams with the headlines that actually hide "empty" news.
At night, asphalt works will be carried out on the streets of Freedom; traffic restrictions must be calculated.
At this time, asphalt insertion works will be carried out in the freeway phase from the Bērzaune Street to Gustav Zemgal Street, which means that drivers will have to calculate limited traffic at this stage.
As the agency LETA learned in Riga, traffic restrictions will begin at this stage from 21 a.m. tonight and asphalting works will last until 12 a.m..7 a.m.
Traffic in the direction of the South will be routed through the tramways.
Drivers must calculate limited traffic during this stage and the additional time spent on the road.
The municipality calls for an understanding of how to deal with the restrictions imposed and to comply with the rules of the traffic organisation.

More than €130 000 is suspected to be held by the accounting officer.
This month, the National Police (PD) Administration for Economic Crimes (ENAP) informed the Agency of the USO representative of Gita Gjibovska, who was detained from a Riga commercial company who had been working in the company for 20 years.
The current information shows that a woman who is suspected of committing illegal activities for several years and who has suffered a total loss of more than 130 thousand euros.
Given that the company’s officials did not closely follow the cash flow and entrust themselves to their employees, they learned about the current machinery only after several years.
The VP ENAP police arrested a woman of birth in 1963 suspected this month, and the company suffered shocks.
In the context of the incident, criminal proceedings have been initiated for recruitment, where they have been carried out to a large extent.
The law provides for the deprivation of liberty for up to ten years by confiscation of property or without confiscation of property.
The detained person is currently subject to a security measure that is not related to the withdrawal of liberty.
In Estonia, Zika virus antibodies were found in nine people.
In Estonia, nine people will be analysed with Zika virus antibodies, which means that they may have been in contact with this infection, the Estonian public radio organisation ERR.
The laboratory information indicates that this year Zika virus tests were conducted for 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been identified from Estonia in the neighbouring countries of Finland and Sweden.
Estonia’s health management data show that no acute cases of Zika’s virus infection have been recorded in the country and in cases of flu-like symptoms, people do not have to carry out a Zika virus test, but they should contact their family doctor.
We have found IgG (Immunoglobulin G-class) antibodies that show that the person being tested is at some point infected with Zika or similar virus.
"It does not mean that the patient has a virus of Zika," explained the head of the laboratory’s Synlab Disease Division, Paul Nábers.
The skin of the genus "Aedes" is transmitted by Zika virus.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of quality car purchases, BNS told the agency in an interview with Auto Association Vice-President Ingus Rúņš.
In fact, it is clear whether the car industry is in competition with dumped prices, Ruth replied in a positive way.
Of course.
The purchases of cars differ from the purchases of services in which handling at prices is easier.
The end result of the car must be paid in any case, since it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Either the buyer is incompetent and does not create a quality purchase, as a result, even though it is often unknown, "purchase".
"Or a very well-known purchase is built to get something concrete, and then there is all this wonder," said the Vice President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically profitable offer as a criterion for determining the buyer, but in part the public still has a false idea of these matters.
Now it's very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically profitable offer!
However, the criteria need to be set in both cases and, when taken into account and evaluated, the decision is taken at the same time as the lowest price principle.
The technical criteria for quality procurement should be very precise and market-friendly.
The point, however, should not be taken into consideration in terms of money.
The points do not require the assessment of fuel consumption, the volume of emissions, service services and the like.
It is the expected life cycle of the car, the journey, etc., and it can also be calculated as a whole.
"The question is then only about which of the scenarios is interested in the customer's own?" explains Rutuņis.
On the other hand, the director of the Auto Association projects, Peter Rubulis, noted that the problems are linked to the fact that often the same person creates purchases for both cars and workplaces and food and these purchases are derived from one sample.
We have also brought to our attention the spare parts of the shopping model, which was difficult to call otherwise than a detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the buyer is very often lacking any understanding of the subject matter and the requirements are simply copied from somewhere," Rubulis acknowledged.
Rutuņš added, on the other hand, that there is a smaller structure that announces the purchase, because there may be more problems.
"It is obvious that this is precisely because there is a lack of human resources and competences," said the Vice-President of the Associations.
Latvian volleyballists do not fight for medals.

"The Answer" accuses the "self-killing unit" of swallowing style.
The South African group "Die Reply" accused Suicid Sqaud of using the film "self-killing unit" for its unique appearance without permission, calling the respected director "small-fated food".
The group's lead singer in Jolandi's mobile app "Instagram" turned to the movie director Warner Bros, saying, "Just like that, David Ajer, you look at our style."
As she claims, the film stars of the War Delavines and Jared Leto have told you that Ajers was in the film field of "Die Reply".
"But you didn't ask permission to rob us," said the singer.
The 31-year-old musician claims that her group member Ninja (Ninja) addressed Ajera with a brief message on this issue, but he "did not answer anything as such a fine meal would happen".
Jolandi argues that Ajers took the scenes from the 2011 short film "Umshini Wam" in which the South African hiphop duo is visible.
She also published a video showing that Ajers Joker and Harley Queen took pictures from the audience.
Leto himself insists that the inspiration of Joker’s image is based on the image of the handicraft David Bowie.
In conclusion, Joland has voted in favour of the highly critical assessment of the film's achievements after the premiere.

Turkey Seeks Revolving Trial Diplomats · Global Voices
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who did not return with the withdrawn staff after the attempt to turn 15 July.
Foreign Minister Mevits Chavusogl said on Friday that from around the world to the time of the conversion attempt to Ankara, 208 Turkish ministry staff were withdrawn, and 32 have been missing "without permission".
Some 18 000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their duties in Turkey, viewing them as loyal US official Fetul Gulen, charged with the development of the government's bidding plan.
Gullen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is one of Turkey's most sought after people.
Kavosoglu said that the US Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss its possible issue.
This issue has become a problem in relations with Turkey, NATO Member State.
The United States opposed Turkey's President Recep Tayyyyip Erdogan's strong weaponry tactics after turning, and Turkey responded to it in an effort to establish closer links with Russia.
Kavosoglu said Turkey's military attachés in Greece have fled to Italy, the attaché in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia, but was sent back, and two Generals from Afghanistan were detained in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two Bangladeshi officials fled to New York, and one of Russia went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryet, quoting military sources, reported that Turkey's military attaché in Jordan was also lost.
The Wall Street Journal, quoting an official of the United States who is aware of this situation, reported that Turkey's military commander, based in Virginia, has requested asylum from the US.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," Kavosoglu said in an interview to the radio organisation NTV.
Since yesterday, the time has come for those who were initially called back.
We will take legal action against those who will not return.
Olympic game organizers are trying to clean the green-coloured diving pool
The Olympic kidneys, which were scheduled for training on Friday, arrived at the closed pool, as organizers needed more time to clean green water before the first individual competitions in the Olympic Games.
The water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, in the middle of a synchronized diving contest.
The organizers claimed that the water competitions were safe even after the larger pool next to the water pool and the synchronized swimming also had a slightly greening effect.
Diving was not yet possible when the athletes arrived at the heat of the morning, even though the pool was finally opened at 13.00 after the local time - only 2 1/2 hours before women competed 3 metres.
The water color looked closer to its normal color, but still with green color.
The American piper Ebie Johnson, who is struggling with a trampline, told her that she had come to the heat just to find out that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote in her tweet that "#FixTheSwamp (save the mud) should be fashionable.
British kidney Tom Deilis, who was blackmailing the bronze in the synchronisation of the platform, also commented on the status of the pool in the tweeter's record.
Hopefully, that means that in the last days, we are not as bad as we are!
Mario Andrad, head of the local organizers’ committee, stressed that the pool is safe for competitions by giving green light for 3 metres.
He agreed that some sportsmen had a problem with water, but he said that it was the result of the pool’s cleaning efforts.
"We repeat repeatedly what we have said all the time - water does not in any way endanger sportsmen's health," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they had no eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw the water becoming green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the amount.
We checked the water again, and it fully responded to the parameters.
Simon Langford, the main speaker of the Polish Water Sports Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision supports the world’s leading organisation FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water needs to be calm so that the pool can get back to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration in the condition of the pool had surprised unprepared organizers.
"Chemicals are not accurate science," he said.
Some things you can see take a while.
In the last few days, the formation of water color in the normal condition has made it even more difficult.
"It's no use," Andrad said.
He added that the sportsmen of the morning had access to dry workouts, but he acknowledged that it was "not ideal."
He explained that the change in the colour of the basin was elevated due to alkaline levels, like aquarium water can become green if not adequately monitored.
When we started doing something to prevent green color, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We cannot use too much chemicals in water because the athletes are training in it," Andrada said.
We could certainly have done better at first so as not to allow the water to become green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.

Shanghai, Taipei, despite the suspension of cross-border communication
However, Shanghai and Taipei will hold an annual city forum in Taipei from 22 to 23 August, the Shanghai municipality announced on Friday, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
This High-level Municipal Officer, Mr. Hailins Shanghai, will lead the delegation represented in the forum, announced by the Government of Shanghai in its official microblog account Sina Weibo.
The Forum has been in the process of rotation of both cities since 2010.
The 2016 forum will focus on the exchange of experiences in areas such as health care, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking "to step up the exchange of experience and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities as reported by the Shanghai Government.
The Taiwanese side has not recognised the agreement reached in 1992, which strengthened a single Chinese principle since the new leader, Tsai Ing-vens, took office in May, as a result of which communication and consultation mechanisms have been suspended.
Ma Ksiaoguang , a spokesman of the National Council for Foreign Affairs of Taiwan, said on Friday that peaceful cross-border relations can exist while the Taiwanese side adheres to the 1992 agreement's political foundations.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experience between the two sides of the city," said MA, stressing that the nature of cross-border relations and the exchange of experience of the city should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan President Meets Chinese Foreign Minister, Hopes for Closer Cooperation
On Thursday, meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Ji, Uganda's President Joveri Musveni thanked China for its long-term support for Uganda's development and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China is a sense of Uganda and Africa's friend, who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President mentioned Tanzania - the construction of Zambia's railway in the 1970s as evidence of China's support, even when China itself had not been particularly fed.
Museveni said that China has implemented multilateral cooperation with Uganda by investing both in infrastructure and business and in cultural exchange, and added that such cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than simply financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to participate in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and in the construction of industrial parks.
He also invites the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and travel it.
Wang She praised Uganda's activities in the areas of industrialization and agricultural modernisation and added that China will continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner for Uganda's cooperation.
Wangs stated that China is ready to do everything possible to help implement Uganda's economic and social development, and added that China and Uganda's cooperation is true and without any political considerations, because it is based on high-level political credibility and time- tested friendship.
He said China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda's infrastructure and industrial parks, as well as support the development of the energy and agriculture sectors of this East African people.
