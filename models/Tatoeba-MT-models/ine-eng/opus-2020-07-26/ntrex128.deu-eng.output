Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wallisian Parliament).
This is why plans to change the name of the National Assembly in Welsh Parliament.
National Assembly members of all political directions are afraid of becoming targets of the spot.
One member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly said that his group was concerned because the name “with “Twp” and “Pwp” is covered.”
For non-valisive readers: In Welsh there is "twp" for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A national assembly member from Plaid Cymru said that the whole group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "muppet".
In this context, the English word w is spoken similar to the English word u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee (National Assembly Committee), which currently drafts a bill for the amendments, said: "The final decision on the names of the members of the National Assembly is of course for the members themselves."
The government of Wales Act of 2017 authorised the Wallisian National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name of the ‘Welsh Parliament’ for the National Assembly was given.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, Welsh Parliament Members (Valisian Members) or WMPs preferred the largest support option for the MWP at a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly appear to propose alternative options, but the call for consensus for President Elin Jones to present a bill within weeks could be a problem.
The Law on Reforms will include further amendments to the way in which the National Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the design of the Committee system.
The members of the National Assembly can finally vote on their names in their debate on the Law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country in "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set up to wage a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with similar name Macedonia.
Athens has long been saying that the name of its northern neighbour means that it raises this claim in the Greek field, and has repeatedly voiced its opposition to EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President, Mr Ivanov, opposed the vote on the amendment, said he would not accept the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name for accession to the EU and NATO is the price to be paid.
The bells of St. Martin's in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"There are no two more today."
He said that the disappearance of the bars would be possible.
"The social life of people today looks different," he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood in which people regularly meet.”
He fears that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the church leaders accept, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with apartments in which people live who do not support the remaining shelters.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings will be white," he said, "and in order to speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these properties will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community came out in the 1930s.
A black community that took up their services nearby became the owners of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street to a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson’s members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "an unscrupulous historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game played worldwide by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind. This was changed 18 years ago to the largest bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been brought up partly by the lay leaders of the church and partly by the Bishop Diocese.
The municipal council – the community’s leading body consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns about the diocese in July that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the community board, although it was not involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured 13-year-olds in California while diving to Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, according to official statements, a Hai attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the broadcaster KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been with friends on the dive for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry of help and rode with several others to the boy to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy would be happy to have caught a praiser. But then he realized that the boy shouted, “I have been bitten!
I've been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his whole cell bone had been broken.
"I write that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’ added Hammel.
The boy was rushed to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The nature of the Hais responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue Swim Captain Larry Giles told the media that a couple of weeks ago a shark was seen in the area. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials stopped for investigation and for security reasons 48 hours the beach access of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Encinitas.
According to Giles, there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans ahead of the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's tackles cosmetic units that are available in shopping houses with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a major effort on the UK's 2.8 billion-pound cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods come back, the larger cosmetic distributions in eleven branches will be tested throughout the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked with the search for supermarkets to make different use of charging surfaces used for television, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of its cosmetic offer for the first time doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket conducts a relaunch of its makeup series "Boutique" so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that younger customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branch sales outlets. The first sales outlet was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second one will be opened during the next year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local needs stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets will increasingly look like shopping houses, as the supermarket chain tries to fight against the discounter Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has set up a series of Habitat sales outlets in hundreds of branch Argos sales sites two years ago. This has increased the food supply and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was sparked.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats early in the year 2000, but ended up after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the drug dealer's branch offices in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds would play a role in the plan when an extended range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, were added to four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetic departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand palette is tailored to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the affordable locations, we are now an attractive goal for cosmetic shopping, which challenges the previous type of purchase."
Peter Jones "excited" after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
"Dragons" The "Star Peter Jones is "slow", after the TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand True.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Mark Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced their withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby crushed "Dragons" The Star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new covenants with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to be "exciting" when the "Golden Girl" of television was added during an intense discussion on Tuesday at the center of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, due to its new business – in the value of up to 1.5 million British pounds – the common homewear and accessories brand Truely can no longer devote enough time.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Mark Goop and would have probably doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from True at Instagram, left Jones Great Britain on the way to one of his holiday resorts.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly at a distance.
It should ensure their long-term future for them over the next decades.
Your decision to withdraw was totally surprising for all the parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch of the market.
In the center of Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" moderator, which is one of Britain's most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the introduction of the market.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, came in March as president.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40% share of Baldwins TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as moderator of the I'm A Celebrity broadcast.
A nearby source of Jones said last night: "We do not comment on his business matters."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism he would have received from the news media for a comment that some would view as "non-presidential" and for such positive statements about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said that the voice of a news moderator follows:
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June of Trump was praised as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have gone to the ground.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's top diplomat, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North did not see the "reaction" of the United States to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he found that the United States had imposed sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We faced a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the mortal remnant of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here," Trump said and showed the crowd directly to him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so this is something difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children are preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on the spot.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the disaster protection authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international actors should participate in the relief measures.
In view of the earthquakes with which Indonesia has been constantly fighting, the country is still being prepared to suffer from natural violence.
While Tsunami protection events were created in Aceh, these are not a daily sight in other coastal zones.
Despite a warning in force, apparently missing Tsunamiwarsirene in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travels between Indonesia and many islands already present a challenge in the best case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster in three days earlier.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure to the core of his campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Yoko seeking re-election next year suffers from financing deficits.
Yoko is also under pressure from constant confessional tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were expelled from their homes and homes when bands from Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with Mackenzie, arrows and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep balance between Chelsea and Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 level of his team in about 27 meters away from the gate of Chelsea.
He shot the ball to the left and then shot him towards the back of the pfosten.
The gun sealed high over the chest and drove to the right top corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get in this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for me,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to see edge and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just accepted the gun."
Chelsea followed a hit in the 25th minute by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard for a half-time with 1:0.
The blues storm gave a pass with the verse back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinkled half into the Liverpool.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good strike pass, so Hazard got into the chest.
Hazard left the defender behind and locked up with a left shot at Liverpool's Alison Becker in the back of the net.
Liverpool plays at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea is facing the UEFA Europe League Videoton at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
The number of Tsunamis deaths in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the accident protection authority on Sunday morning.
Many people were to be caught in the ruins of buildings, which were brought to ruin by the earthquake of the magnitude of 7.5 from Friday, which had triggered up to six meters high waves, the public speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was translated into broken buildings with the drums.
Police take a man, 32, for murder suspicions after a woman has been raped
After finding a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with stabbings in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspicion.
The police ask the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed close to John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious about us.
In addition, I ask all the people, particularly taxi drivers, who may have taken on something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of major importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today afternoon are friends who believe the woman to know, met at the tator to explore where she was found this morning.
The investigation was ongoing, and the police informed that it was about to inform the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was silent when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours until they can enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
She keeps saying, "That's so scary."
At 2:00 p.m. there were two police vehicles inside the lockdown and another vehicle before the lockdown.
There were several police officers who were watching the block.
Persons with information will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers under number 0800 555 111 anonymous and to refer to protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue before Parliament will be the newest monument to the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for its destruction of so many cultural and religious art products in England by its fanatic Puritan supporters.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "tourism" and "probably rewriting the story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster became the goal.
The image tower in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence to be celebrated for the 19th century's dominant opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure, which is still worth it to many.
Goldsmith said regarding Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is defended by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, than anyone who considers Parliament to be against pressure from outside, in his case, of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully relevant presentation is the subject of further historical debates.
It is certain that in the middle of the 17th century the conflict has formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this scourge.
Its services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, to whom only the last name "Yuan" was named, was found with a blood flow in the vicinity of a pig market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou dead, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pig vaccines in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
According to reports on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan, he was on his way to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a nearby pig store.
He said that in the stable a large male pig with blood was found on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound heavy pig had consumed the farmers.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and stung," was quoted by the cousin, who was named after the name "Wu", by the Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One market manager told the Evening News that the pigs were blocked to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the Tatort.
Yuan's family and the market authorities negotiate reports of compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilos of heavy pigs entered a whale farm between itself and a tractor until the woman of the farmer could swallow the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a "dissolver".
“They are only played.
They're happy and are very curious, ... they're not about to hurt someone.
You only have to treat them with the right respect," he said.
The rest of Hurricane Rosa brings widespread strong rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods of rain to North Mexico and the South West of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 p.m., Rosa’s wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a Category 1 Hurricane, were 620 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific begins to form a Trough that leads east to the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is carried north into the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa will be triggered on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimeters of precipitation.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical humidity creates strong rainfalls in the south-west due to interactions with the surrounding trog.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous fluctuating flooding, water-driving protection and possibly soil in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the fluctuation of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of fluctuating flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical defeats, it is urgent to go to the desert on foot.
Strong defeats can lead to floods from the canyon, and winds bring local winds as well as wind, which brings dust with it.
The nearby Trog brings strong rains to parts of the coast of southern California.
A total impact of more than one centimeter can be achieved, which can lead to a low level of protection in the water and smooth roads.
This would be the first defeat of the rainy season in this region.
The first single tropical rain shows reach Arizona on Sunday and Monday. On Monday and Tuesday it rains.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and stops on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the constant summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the central and eastern United States, a warmer beginning of October with widespread temperatures is expected at 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of over-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million viewers have seen on Thursday at six television networks the festive statements of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political patsituation began. On Friday, television broadcasters interrupted their regular program due to a change in the last minute: one negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, and the FBI is expected to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, that she had bothered and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million observers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company detected average viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewers in offices.
To get this back to the right perspective: This corresponds in about the audience numbers at a play-off football game or at the Oscar award.
The sender Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, listed Nielsen with an average of 5.69 million viewers of all-day hearings the highest number of all networks.
ABC came in second place with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reported that Nielsen had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained large after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had issued a statement that he would therefore vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by the CNN and CBS, as protestors put him in the chair on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee with strong words.
It stood for a minute with a reduced view while it was closed. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe that he tells the country the truth?"
"They have power, while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added before the chair closed that he would have more to say in the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent hours later live than the Justice Committee should vote on the continuation of the appointment of Kavanaughs to the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do this only on the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, would investigate the charges against the candidates next week.
Flake was partly convinced by interference with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a bribe with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused in an interview with the Sunday Times critic of their plans for the withdrawal from the European Union, the future of Britain for political purposes and undermining the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet on September 29, 2018 at the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In addition to the interview with her on the title page, other interviews published on the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "chequers plan" for Brexit, by proposing that the mutual entry of duties through Britain and the EU should be described as "very absurd".
Killing shots on Wayde Sims: Police take suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested after reports of Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published video recordings of the clash between Sims and Simpson. According to the police Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, the police secured the glasses on the roof and said that the glasses DNA of Simpson had been found.
After a question, Simpson told the police that he had been standing on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal lab of the state police, the Southern University Police and the people in the area for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement authority for 'their care and their pursuit of justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m large wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning the LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, said the team was "deeply scared" and "stand under shock".
"You're always afraid of this before," Wade said.
Volcano sucks ash in Mexico City.
Ash emitted from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of strikes and injuries.
Pictures in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have established, since September 2017, an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico, increased activity at the 72 km southeastern volcano located in the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between the police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the PD and the Pro-Independence Demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were detained by the preparedness police, buried them with eggs and also spilled colour powder, so that dark dust clouds emerged in the streets normally populated by tourists.
In the course of the next day, it also came to handcuffs with the police who used their hammers to curb the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups were scandalized "no forgotten, no forgiveness", while they faced Unionists who called "long live Spain".
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for smaller injuries in the protests.
However, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen as illegal by Madrid, separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had decided by a vast majority on independence, although the electoral participation was low, as the dissidents boycotted most of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the holocausts.
Pro-independence groups had camped in the open on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry before joy because they could choose, but now we hang tight," he said.
In spite of an important, but still pressing, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulties maintaining the momentum. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in exile or in prison, where they wait for their procedures because of their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest for the police on his phone, said that the conflict was cut off by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been investigating since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to reduce democratic values and suppress the oppression of the Spanish government is to join the European elections," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the house was destroyed by car
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was robbed several times by a car.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, it may have been shot on the car with an armbrush.
Menga strike means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first gate for Livingston won the victory.
The rising Livingstone FC surprised the rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Menga's hit proved crucial to Gary Holt's team being able to compete with hibernian in the second half of the year.
Gerrard's team remains in the Premiership without a win in this season and is facing the hearts that fall back on the next Sunday.
Previously on Thursday, the rangers in the Europe League are hosts for Rapid Vienna.
In the meantime, Livingstone can increase its winning series in the division to six games, which means that Chief Trainer Holt has not been downgrading since his acquisition of Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team should have been in charge for a long time before the hit, as its direction put the Rangers at the forefront of the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, however, slowed down before the door. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was in the car to meet Craig Halketts head shots at the door.
The hosts agreed to let the rangers play ahead, as they knew that they could prevent the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate came to be.
The Rangers left a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance to bring Declan Gallagher and Robinson Menga together in a shooting position. This shot the door with a ball contact from the center of the scene.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the resistance of the hosts, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained largely inflamed.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly was forced once to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers-Torhütter Allan McGregor with his feet, and Litgow closed the ball from another standard situation in Livingstone.
Flangs were repeatedly brought back to the prison of Livingstone and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required punishments were refused – one by Halkett against Glenn Middleton and one by hand.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingstone.
They were excellent without exception and have again exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Her playing style and team have barely changed since her return to the top teams, but Holt has paid a great praise for the way in which he has guarded the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were at work throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard, they couldn't reach this standard.
Her last ball was not enough – only once they were able to pass through the host team – and this is something like a call for the rangers in the middle of the table.
Receive Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue sky ruled when the government superiors of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There were disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and EU accession to Turkey.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for holding a 25,000 strong crowd of people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters came in close to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also received hearings. They condemned Erdogan's politics as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as a hero and by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Cycling Deaths at Car Crash
In a collision with a car, a biker died in London.
The crash took place around 10:15 a.m. in British summer time near the crossing of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and health professionals took care of the man who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another biker was killed by an accident with a driver's flight on the Children Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next family.
Road closures and routes for buses are set up, and the drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured in unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in a prison for men in unrest.
The unrest broke out on Sunday around 9:30 p.m. in the British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stopped.
Specialized "Tornado" officials were added to end the disturbances in which eight seats are involved and restricted to one wing.
Officials were treated locally for minor injuries in the face.
One spokesperson for Prison Service said: “A specially trained prison staff was used to address a still ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that the police officers will be handed over and possibly spend longer time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, officials were sent to prison to deal with severe disturbances in which the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluctuating floods (probably profit areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression will reach Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen in the beginning of next week when the rest of Hurricane Rosa pull over the southwests marked by the desert and bring the risk of fluctuating flooding with them.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of fluctuating floods on Monday and Tuesday from west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada, as well as to the east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, flag staff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will get closer to rain on Monday evenings and on Tuesday it will move directly across Phoenix.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “only ten tropical cycles have come close since 1950 as a tropical storm or tropical depression of Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was located as Hurricane within 64 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with single to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest marked by the desert, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be singled out and up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who do not have the risk of fluctuating flooding, the defeats associated with Rosa may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, these rains are likely to be useful in part because in the south-west there is now drought.
According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona's extreme drought occurs, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have herring strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometres per hour and is 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. After that, the Hurricane will move 19 kilometres per hour north.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thereby weaken.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa will meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on the ground.
The rainfalls can be strong in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the north-west of the Sonora desert, precipitation amounts of 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible," said weather.com.
Then Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the border to Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move through Arizona to the south of Utah until the late service evening.
"As a major risk, very strong defeats are expected in connection with Rosa or her remains in Baja California, the north-west of the Sonora Desert and the south-west of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these rainfalls, life-threatening fluctuating floods and water-driving protection are expected in the desert as well as in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the end of a 16-year-old with stabbings in Somerset, three boys were arrested in their teens and a 20-year-old man under suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teen was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the skrupulous and unheard tactics of the Democrats," Trump said at a broadcast in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the entire nomination process, Kavanaugh was "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday in front of the Congress and said that Christine Blasey Ford was guilty of sexual harassment, and he had assaulted them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also stated in the hearing that she had been accused.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw the brightness, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced juridical heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the public," he said to the majority of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not going in, but I'm actually going in," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission to "resistance and block".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the latest on Friday in the Senate, a senior member of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes killed in Indonesia, victims rise
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a party on the beach of the city of Palu, when up to six meters high waves hit the beach and many people died and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The Tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the threat came through the tsunami yesterday, people still went to the beach and didn't get away with it immediately, and they fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Disaster Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, he swam cars, trees and houses with, he hit the ground with everything," Nugroho said. He added that the Tsunami was pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people on the flight before the tsunami were climbing on trees and had survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and placed in 24 centers in Palu.
Many destroyed buildings and shops, curved and destroyed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water, were published by the disaster protection authority.
On Saturday, the coastal city was excavated by other descendants.
The Earthquake series was to be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released from the massive bombs released on Friday was the 200th energy segment of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the Tsunami could have been enlarged, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “inclusive” and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the drums of broken buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongalla, which is closer to the epicenter of the baby, could be higher.
The communication with Dongalla was completely corrupted by Nugrohos's words, and there was no information.
According to the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was repeatedly criticised for not being informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves reportedly received official information at the time of the warning.
Amateur footage published in social media show a man on the top floor of a building who is desperate with calls alerts people on the street under him to the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall will be on the shore and swimming in buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately check the authenticity of the recordings.
Through the bee and the tsunami, there was a massive power crash that interrupted the communication around Palu and the authorities made it difficult to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities with support, but the evacuated still need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and has only been reopened for aid measures.
For Sunday, a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of Tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Dongalla reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tenthouses in the inner courtyard of their office, but after Dosebas said they went on the way to scenes of desertification.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief teams began with the hard task of launching disaster relief, some demonstrated that experts abroad would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the site of an accident has been declared to be a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened until now.
"At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support.
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami fell from Friday over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing people hoped for them on one of the wonders that revealed some of the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue forces release a woman who was stabbed for two days by drummers next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia at the end of Asian games.
Others were imprisoned in Roa-Roa-Hotel, as Mandagi added, his students.
"As an elder in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the message from the Roa-Roa-Hotel's intruder under the paragliders made the round, disappointed whatsapp news to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
His messages, however, instead led to blue hooks only to gray question marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.

According to a press release by the Newport police, on Friday morning, Newport on the Levee Diebe stole an employee from Brink’s in filling up a cash machine of $26,750.
The driver of the vehicle had learned a money machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to borrow more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came behind the staff of Brink's" and stole a bag full of money that was intended for the machines.
According to the press release, several suspects fled the Tatort. However, the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of suspects will be asked to contact the Newport police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The beings officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been the top label Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight albums published in June.
The change takes place at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He is acting as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has given up "emotional reasons".
The word is not only abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance for the West, according to its own statement.
“I think “ye” is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “du”, said West this year in a conversation about his album with RadioModerator Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means “the only one”, only “Ye” became a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects rather what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with the West, has already written his name with and without string and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to resort to military violence against the civilian population, during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the scene and killed 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led to juvenile criminal gangs.
US should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's enhanced activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research expenditure in this field, says Investor and KI-practice Kai-Fu Lee, who was active in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI notifications from various areas of the U.S. government, even if the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the number 1 in the area of KI innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the KI research budget would be due to the fact that all other countries are so far behind the USA, a good start. We are looking for the next KI breakthrough," Lee said.
The duplication of financial resources could double the chances that the next major success in the USA would be achieved, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent KI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that won the highest-ranking U.S. Othello player. Later he was the leader of Microsoft Research and President of the Google Netherlands in China.
Lee appreciated previous technology competitions of the US government such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the date of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lees, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"It is not China that removes the academic superpowers, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up Korypheen from universities to work at KI.
According to Lees, an amended immigration policy in the United States could also be supportive of the US's KIC efforts.
"I think that people promoted by KI should be offered Greencards automatically," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to participate in the partner from industry and science. The White House also announced the formation of a special committee for artistic intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the "AI Next" initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in KI research.
In the meantime, U.S. laws have not done anything about the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country's name
On Sunday, the population of Macedonia agreed in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", and this measure would present a decade-old dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it raises this claim in the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has put a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether the vote will reach 50 percent of the vote required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs argue that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safe life for us all," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, many Members have said that they would stick to the result so that it is crucial.
The amendment would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Committee said that no reports on irregularities had been made by 1 p.m.
However, only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 per cent of registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, gave their vote in the referendum on the change of country name, which Macedonia would open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs to tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we would like to join the principal, not through the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgent investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that there will be a large majority for this because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
According to him, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the vote must be at 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the policy of the provincial government since its takeover in May.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered by the entire Brighton rebellion to reach a gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling, on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, passed the Brighton Battle at the 2nd victory of Manchester City.
Aguero let his encounter in the 65th minute look ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field.
He ran between three Brighton opponents and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green trikots.
He played around a defender and then picked up several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's fine.
Then he shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the fine room to play the ball back to Aguero, who with his right shoe Brighton-Torhütter Mathew Ryan and shot at the right side of the network.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he got a door right now."
It was Sterling, however, who provided the Sky Blues with the initial advantage in the Premier League Duell.
This door fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero won the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good strike pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker shot the ball into the net just before he went out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim v. Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies game
Since the Nationals are excluded from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another use.
However, the always powerful joker hopes to stand on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies on the hill, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies that have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the Playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the nations on Friday evening, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we’re not playing at all, we can at least throw away because we know the atmosphere in the audiences here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but have been told to let jokes throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for which this would be the 34th use as a starting player, practiced in the Bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
Washington's legal hands this season have a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump stops advertising in West Virginia
The president referred directly to the situation in connection with the Brett Kavanaugh, whom he selected for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the inter-election.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
That's one of the big, big – I don't get in, but actually I get in, so I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it now.
And they are determined to take power again with all their means, you see the community, the despicability.
It is no matter who they hurt, who they have to overcome, in order to obtain power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, look at their mission to "resistance and block".
"And you will see it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "suffering and bitter and disgusting and indiscriminate".
He called it the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Diana Feinstein, which triggered loud drills in the audience.
“Do you agree with their answer?
Did you get the document outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer valid for all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party agreed to beat me, this came a little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to whom it is said that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly, since she had been energetically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for expressing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironically similar issues, of which Jeremy and former top politicians were not an opinion.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour said on Friday that "the meetings should be inclusive and productive".
Most of the Friday GC meetings in my eight years as local Labour Agent were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most meetings today are not marked by this tone, and the promised "friendlyer, more manageable" policy has been forgotten for a long time since it started at all.
It becomes increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion will then be judged whether they are accepted by the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. Colleagues, with whom I previously believed to share similar political views, now expected me to make a turnaround and take positions with which I would otherwise never have agreed – whether in terms of national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak in public – while it doesn’t matter what I say – there’s a period of skiing in the social media, which calls for my election, which pushes the political centre and says that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who are facing daily a flood of sessist or racist attacks and yet never get too small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that seizures have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn asked the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we no longer allow all opinions to be taken into account, and with each application of suspicion and any amendment of the electoral rules, the party will be more closely involved.
In the last two years, I have often been asked to raise my head and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would be "no problem".
But I didn't go into politics.
Since 32 years ago as a student, I have suffered the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the whole school has literally joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a community minister as well as as cabinet minister.
I've never made a hero out of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be confused about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday application that, in view of the fact that the country will fall to a brexit, damage the households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I did not send this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not be held back from so many threats of election or political thinking, in my opinion, to act best for all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17: Unbeatable Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have confused the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr won the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tannent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams unbeatable at the top of the table.
Last but not least, the success of the home team was due to its alleged defense as well as to its better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have made better use of their chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, due to a yellow card, and Jason Baggot started a non-extensive attempt.
Climo developed the leadership of Ayr with a penalty step before he achieved a hit directly in half and then reached an increased attempt in isolation, so it stood for Ayr's break 17:5.
Melrose, however, began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a longer interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, which was carried by the playing field. After the continuation, Ayr made his lead by an increased attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as Captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again Melrose paid the additional man enormous pressure at the end of a phase by a non-extensive attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained from the criminal gas from a touchdown behind the emerging ayr package.
Climo has increased almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrongs arrested Boxkick and sent Flanders Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new careers in gastronomy
"Still Game" Star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a change in the hospitality business after it turned out to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC release, whose spin books he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Both have announced that the upcoming nine staff will be the last of the shipment, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the managing director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one of the Scottish Sun's sources indicated that Kiernan was interested in climbing into Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, including the country, hopes that a court will open its way to peace
The sailors patrol the marine capital quarter of La Paz, decorated with cloth.
In public buildings there is a more blue flag.
The motto is: “The sea is our legal property.
It is a duty to win back."
In all parts of Bolivia, including the country, the memory of the 19th-century loss of resources in a bloody conflict is as vivid as the desire to go back to the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for an International Court of Justice ruling to be held on 1 October following five years' consultations.
"Bolivia has the tendency, a spirit of unity and peace, and expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the IGH's judgment on large screens, hoping that the Hague court will decide for Bolivia's demand. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea after decades of sporadic talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who won a controversial fight next year for his re-election, is also very much at stake on Monday's ruling.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would change little.
The UN body established in the Netherlands is not empowered to speak to Chilean territory and has determined that it will not be decided on the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the case was “not complicated”, the IGH’s judgment was six months after the closing fee.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has broken down the question of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She pointed out that Morale's war rhetoric has stifled any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some time, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, reiterated the view that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of disputes for each other’s benefit”, he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – uses the theme of the sea as a political bridge.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to recognize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never put up their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to implement commitments made during a summit between the Heads of State of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to have been on the move for more than three months after the summit with North Korean state chief Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri mentioned the idea that other sanctions and the resistance of the United States against a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the North into the knee, as "Herngespinst".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to accept the statement without Pjöngang taking major disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, it is widely known that Pjöngang is serious about giving up an arsenal in which the country is likely to see the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans for next month a visit in Pjöngang to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Modern view in Paris shows the latest collections for huge head coverings that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your Hut collection or completely clear the sun, you don't have to search any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a palette of crazy oversized head coverings for their 2019 summer collection that fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical caves have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations over the track path.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a spring-like wide edge that just pressed the heads of the models.
As other super-dimensional accessories with jewels, watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple were shown. However, these are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were fitted with upholstered lips and had more similarities with Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkel and a diving glasses, while another looked like a molten iron.
And if you want to put on another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional huts follow directly to "La Bomba", the narrow hut with 60 centimeters wide border, all of which carry from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpracticed hat, which hit large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the track: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as big as the model wearing a bath suit that held the bag.
The bass bag in red orange with bast francs and a white leather hook was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' Summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage said regarding F EMAIL: “I expect large cabins and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for the next summer. The designer has given so much insight that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will not be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens indispensable
Scotland's independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. In 2018, this continued with further outstanding results and is supported only by individual and joint success in the fields of sport, art, music and other Community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) aim to provide their students and their parents with the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as a world citizen.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum in fact, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak with him in your own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year's exam show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the lists of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved Note A in higher studies.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved Note A in higher examinations, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered to be electoral subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons why employers called for problems in the occupation of open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly required when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open-ended languages are available, these knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically give priority to competitors.
According to a survey by more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to lead an entertainment, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for children today that we invest in language learning.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught which are considered by 2020 as the most important for the United Kingdom, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever the interests of your child lie, independent schools will always have a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills needed for their success, as always the future looks.
At this point in a global economic environment it cannot be said that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication capacity'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this opportunity of choice, diversity and excellence.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James arrive for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon end.
Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes will he play, however, is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", said Walton on the official website of the lakers.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, after training, James was asked about his plans for the six-game pre-season game plan of the lakers.
"I don't need any pre-season games at this stage of my career," he said.
Time for Trump's announcement in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five events planned for the next week, including well-known places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the holiday at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress.
When does Trump's announcement take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
Trump's announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East coast time).
You can track Trump's announcement in West Virginia below as livestream on YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of the Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on charges of sexual misconduct conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains up to one week in the sweat, while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in November.
Therefore, President Trump's election team told Reuters that these five events will serve to "mobilize volunteers and supporters in the coming week while the Republicans try to keep their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"The control of the Congress is so important for its plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible while the operational election season is nearing," said a Trump-Val struggle speaker who did not want to name his name against Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, visitors from Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate in the Wesbanco Arena broadcast planned for the evening in Wheeling, and report to the media from Pittsburgh.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who are in charge.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him up in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team shows the readiness to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four parties may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a pure invention as a sport concept, but one that the players really believe, and that especially in competitions like these.
So where is the moment of her opinion now?
"They were in charge with six points, and now there are four, so I think this means a little bit of a moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when he left the playground.
Europe is, of course, in favour and is ahead of four points, while twelve others follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and can present three of four points each.
Spieth was unmistakably strong from the end to the green and follows a good example.
In the course of his rounds, the goutary screams were louder when he narrowed down an important pott to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas retreated after two holes with two points.
His Putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar cry that concludes that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really need to clean up and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of the individual players.
18 liars to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the only player in the last two days, have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas, and thus undoubtedly wrote the story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is at four of four points and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who didn't beat a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the apparently flowing energy between them and the released amount undermines that they are the players to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to win a possible European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both on different holes at the same time.
Speaking of European fame, however, it would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedes into a glue that they could not get near.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them.
The four and four pairs are based on the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change quickly, so fascinatingly from the near.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are in charge on the last day. However, this round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, have doubted.
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6 in leadership
Europe lies behind the four and four parties from Saturday to the United States at 10:6 and is taking a strong lead in the last day of Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the Tiger Woods struggling with difficulties and thus could book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to regain the trophies lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four of us in the morning against the American team that was playing the wrong game and won the 3-1 series.
In the four parties, the United States won more resistance and won two matches, but the resistance could not be lifted.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points in the twelve items played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points as the first European newling, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend of Molliwood, won only four points as the second duo in the history of Ryder Cup in their four opening match.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they perfectly harmonized the detonated Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliance shine, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in succession.
Justin Rose, who had retired during the four mornings, returned and played the four parties as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant day in the south-west of Paris, not everything was in the way of their ideas.
The three-fold Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measuring slot for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the fours, they won a 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter who played for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 fourths after losing the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup it has only occurred twice that a team came back after it had gone into detail with a remainder of four points. However, as a title holder for Fury's team, it is sufficient to keep the trophies.
After they've only been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral equipment without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen their suspicion of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons on its own.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken "essential measures of good will" last year. For example, it stopped nuclear and rocket testing to decompose nuclear testing sites and committed itself not to increasing nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we do not see a corresponding reaction from the USA," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will never be alone first."
While Ri confided in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successful steps, his statement seemed to be significant when she did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the past, as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an outgoing US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this he had assured Kim to work on the "Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pjöngang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes claims after the closure of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States consists of "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions in order to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes the "explanation of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the knee is a brainwash of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our suspicions."
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US chief of state had highlighted at the beginning of the week with the United Nations.
Instead, at three meetings between Kim and the South Korean state chief Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the Minister said: "If South Korea were the other party in the case of denuclearization, it would not have come to this stop in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
However, the tone of Ris Speech differed enormously from his last year speech when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea rockets on the mainland of the United States after "the evil president" Trump Kim had referred to himself as "a rocket man" as a suicide mission.
This year Trump, who had threatened North Korea’s “complete destruction” last year, took over Kim to the United Nations with praise for his courage in terms of disarmament. However, he said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions should remain in force until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday Trump said he did not have a time frame for it: "whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngang for the steps taken.
However, on Thursday, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said in relation to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must in any case be pursued energetically until we have achieved the complete, final and verified denuclearisation."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unilaterally reinforced sanctions against North Korea in order to fund the withdrawal of Pjöngang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjöngang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjöngang, he said that progress had been made, only for hours later, to be accused of North Korea, he made “pass-like demands”.
North Korea promised to decommission this month at a meeting with Moon, a missile base and an atomic complex when the United States took 'appropriate measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" were security guarantees that had given the Trump in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the growing macho culture, keeping up with caffeine and learning over the whole night.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion according to the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to call the course into his life after having given a lecture on the effects of sleepiness on learning.
“At last, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only experiencing it now, in my last year?’
After her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. I was surprised," he said to The Telegraph.
This year's course for the first time explained to the students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after she had found that students were under heavy sleepiness during the week.
The one hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee tables, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information on the effect of caffeine and light as well as on the effects of lack of sleep on sports performance and on the importance of sleepiness.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep sickness can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer.
Then they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine by means of a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that the student behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of having a "night shift" is still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
To ensure sufficient good sleep, the "space gun" of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and fear, he said. Furthermore, a weight gain was avoided, as sleepy sleep would put the brain in the hungry mode, so that they would be hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had one of his courses in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study programme before taking up their studies at the competitive university.
At the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should wake up to sleeptime and wake up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" resulting from electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the Circadian rhythm out of the touch. This leads to problems when sleeping.
Livingston Against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor against Gerards Players
The Rangers lost another outside game when the hit by Dolly Menga for Steven Gerard's unifying team meant a 0:1 downside at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first outdoor victory since the 4:1-triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added Gerrard the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team was behind eight points behind the far-reaching Hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before half-time, and the inspired rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind hibernian at the Tordifference.
The Rangers also threatens further trouble after having to be treated for a headache by an object which appears to be thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that took over Ayr and reached the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, he remained among the same eleven Livingstone players who took one point to their hearts last week, and must have been thrilled to see how his well-trained team held their opponent on foot and down.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They were only supposed to get a door after two minutes when Menga's first release, Scott Pittman, led to Allan McGregor's gate. However, the middle-field player missed his chance and shot him.
Then a long release from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his opposition partner Alan Lithgov was only able to pass through the back post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously the view that after a quarter hour, he would have received a penalty for a conflict between him and Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not apply the Colombian complaint.
The Rangers arrived in the first half of the year only two torso shots, but the former Ibrox-toorhüter Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a shot taken by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston hits in the 34th minute may not correspond to the game run, it is not to be lied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs during a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball at Scott Robinson, who held the peace and searched Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted for half-time and replaced Coulibally against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediately effect when the player brought Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the ball.
However, Livingstone continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game that lies with them, with Lithgov and Halkett getting a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded its leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and refused Jacobs before Lithgow passed a head ball from the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also called for a sentence late after a match with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning German: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger numerator.
Since becoming the standard element of science, geiger has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in all the world is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a geographer used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Indeed, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can contribute to the immune system, "see" untreated cells.
A new cancer vaccine can contribute to the immune system, to "see" and destroy decomposed cells.
The vaccine contributes to the detection of decomposed cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves the removal of immune cells that are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of common cancer protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The egg cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that contributes to the immune system has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method allows a patient to take immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can see the many cancers common protein HER2. Afterwards, the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of different types of cancers", including breast, eggstock, lung and intestinal cancers, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method used to treat cancer cells in patients with immunosuppressive cells has helped to treat leukaemia.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump trirade after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It wasn't good.
Kanye West was set up at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he widely praised and said he wanted to join the presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-America Great Again hat, he continued with a cannon against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.”
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywoodstar made a joke about Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on the charges raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West Schimpfade has not been sent, it was uploaded by the comic book Chris Rock in social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about the West.
West also complained to the public that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They took me behind the stage.
They said, “Don’t go out with the hat.”
You fucked me up!
And then they say that I was in a depressing area," he said to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the missing area?" He said he would "draw my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His remarks triggered at least twice the noises from the audience, and SNL-Actives were painfully affected, according to Variety. One person said in the magazine: “It was still in the studio.”
West was later obliged to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a talk entitled "I Love It", where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, YOU HAVE DECKED THE MASSE HAST.”
However, talkshow moderator Karen Hunter tweeted, West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I would like to not reward someone who, in my opinion, makes himself or herself an ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his or her “art”).
He's free.
The same applies to us." she added.
Prior to the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The beings officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg brought the name Snoop Lion, and of course changed Prince, the deceased musician, his name in a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBOs of violence marked medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said such roles on the screen would have resulted in boys often having to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said he believed that something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic humanity in the #MeToo season.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31 who was also involved in the Game of Thrones, added that the solution to the problem was “very important”.
"I personally find the question very important, what has been wrong with humanity at the moment," he said.
"What have we added to the problem that we now see?"
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characteristics, television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the street, that the boy has the feeling of having to body this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change this?
For the young men have gone astray.
He added in the interview that after the end of the series next summer he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels by “Game of Thrones”. He had “suffer enough battlefields and horses”.
From November on, Harington is in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West" to see the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently said that for him the best was "Game of Thrones" that he had known his wife Rose.
"I have met my wife on this mission, so this is how I have kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantastic Ygritte series with numerous Emmys, the lovers of Harington's character Jon Snow.
In June 2018, the two married Leslies family members in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases by sex.
So far, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected in this way with HIV was almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was criminalized in 1997 in China, however, the discrimination of members of the LGBT community is to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to insufficient protection in the transport of sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees have allowed the data of the GOP senators to be secure, criticizing "hazardous lies" and "sworn theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the staff of the U.S. House of Representatives, opposed the claims on Saturday, published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Democrat from Los Angeles expressed the view that the claims of "ultra-justice" experts and websites would be disseminated.
"Lithuanian lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published is intended to include the private addresses and phone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate committee on the charges against Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh for sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was assigned to Waters' office and published the information of a member of Waters' staff, reported The Hill.
"This unwarranted accusation is absolutely wrong and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for ensuring this information.
This unfounded accusation is absolutely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters‘ Declaration quickly triggered online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This Dementi is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You mustn't be proud.
You must not question the defendant's motives.
You must be calm and let go."
Skinner Waters’ reaction to the criticism of the Democrats at Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics, seemed to have acted too furiously on Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who attends the mid-term elections to resolve water, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and prosecution authorities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be taken into account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Criticism about "Johnny English – You only live three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in any UK-coloured new film. It also seems to apply to this replay of the action comedy parody “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spion, who started it” and in 2011 with “Johnny English – Now just right” again.
Will an ironic self-paradise on the topic, as we are obviously accustomed to, be the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glamorous, grimassen cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signalled more than anything else that he was a general comical creation for cinematographic visitors in the non-English area.
He is, of course, once again the busy secret agent, who is curiously cool and worldly, while in fact he is from something Clouseau, a prisoner Mr. Bean and a cuckold of this bursary, who has contributed a single note to the title song of "The Hour of Victory" at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind retired travelers and international secret agents, who played Atkinson in the recently forgotten Barclaycard TV stores.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I felt as Johnny English neared a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves soon hung on his helmet.
Atkinson's performance for physical comics is increasing, but humor seems rather weak and rare, especially because the "serious" films such as "007" and "Mission Ne" now offer certain comedian elements.
The humor seems more to be directed to children than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mishandling is not as impressive and focused as Atkinson's stupid filmgag in the role of the bean.
The eternal current prize is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very to the detriment of the serving agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, a blond and stressed figure that is already facing the complete collapse because of her political inconsistency: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
They inform their secret service consultants that all active spies have been removed and therefore have to get someone out of rest.
This is also part of the great Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher in a sent institution, but there is informal teaching in the work as a undercover agent. There are a few gags in it, because English offers a espionage academy that remembers "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency hearing and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bow, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, whose role is somewhat lost by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terriblely wrong in your Majesty's secret service, are back in action. They meet Olga Curylenko's beautiful female fatale Ophelia Bullettova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously in the bonds of a charismatic tech billionaire, the window of Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy. He claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their odyssey of grotesque sparrows: As a Kellner dressed they put a cool French restaurant in fire, they make sure of chaos when they slip on board Voltas Luxuryacht, and English opens pure anarchy when he tries to make himself familiar with the interior of Voltas House with a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, although all the records are drawn, but so sympathetic and funny she is also, the subject is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
Pretty moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, "Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that is really right for his talent?"
Labour disputes to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party wishes to report that business leaders will pass on the savings achieved by the KI revolution (art intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
This would allow the employees to have a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country for the benefit of the workers is "appropriate".
Conversion to a four-day week was promoted by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said regarding the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a work week of four days is an effort that is consistent with the party's approach to restoring economic balance for workers and with the party's general industrial policy strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party has already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson of the Labour Party said: "In a four-day week it is not party policy and it is not considered by the party."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell specified his presentation last week at the Labour Conference of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "experts" in public supply companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their full share, as a labor government could take "abduction" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the relevant plans to recruit employees to the executives of companies and set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who cancel annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy express themselves in the news magazine "60 minutes", whether the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh might change its opinion
The FBI's investigation into the proposals against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could affect the Republican senators in order to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring some days, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I announced in the debate that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him later, this claim was made, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be measured in stone.
"My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it had to be a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know: Brett has fought this hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was contributed to reducing poverty within this festival?
On this Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will take place to fight poverty in the world with an impressive lineup to stars and an equally impressive mission.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year on 7th time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To receive a gratis ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty –.
How successful is the project when you think that Global Citizens are still 12 years to reach the goal?
Is it the idea to look at a cool free concert, a meaningful opportunity to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called cliquetivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global citizens reported that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011.
These actions are intended to contribute to attracting leading politicians from around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars were already paid or entered into by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementing companies with a United Kingdom seat, who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with 35 million US dollars to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, following more than 5,000 actions with which the United Kingdom was invited to improve the food situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
As an answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and challenging path with heights and depths.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will have success, as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who take part in this year's New York event, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The United States could use the Navy for blockage purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can take back to the Navy if necessary so that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke reported.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legal government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to do this.
"The United States can ensure, together with the Marine, that the seaways remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that understood itself as "the voice of electricity consumers" in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington's practices in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he described Russia as "One Trick Pony" with a fossil-dependent economy.
The declarations were made when the government was under Trump to extend the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replace Russia with the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unmeasured" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trump Berlin became Moscow as a "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion US dollars, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres to be an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The USA received a counterwind from Germany that confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country joins in our energy supply," says the board of the BDI Dieter Fight after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "check out a presidential candidate for 2020," says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidate after the mid-elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to examine a presidential candidate on 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump was heading in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
In her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, Warren, a candidate for the Supreme Court, did not take a sheet in front of his mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation was, of course, necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren electorate does not believe that it should run for 2020.
According to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the Senate should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidature of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent that supports a potential candidature, and 48 percent that are against it.
The other names of prominent democrats who come to terms with a potential candidate for 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden informed him that he would decide officially by January.
Sarah Palin expresses herself on the Donald Trump-Rally for post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering under the Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son can do, what he can do when he comes back, can sense everything other families that feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers come back,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that she had changed back, that she had returned to the country, that they had returned, and wondered if there was this respect in front of what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence with a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 Federal States and D.C. support legal aid to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal aid to the new US policy that reject victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 federal states and the district made an expert statement on Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who is in charge of politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace-against-session complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy was not announced.
She reported that her partner "and his violent son-in-law" abused them, but US officials refused their asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace, known as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum before domestic violence.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "was ignored by decades of legislation at the state, state and international level".
"The Federal Act stipulates that all applications for asylum shall be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that this court is in breach of this principle," the Court of Justice stated.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse access to the country had an adverse impact on the US economy, as immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary workforce.
In June, the Lawyer General Jeff Sessions ordered that victims of domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs should no longer be granted asylum.
"Asyl is there for all those who leave their home country because they are persecuted or afraid because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction," the session said in its announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to exacerbate all problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems people have to struggle with every day around the world.
Succeeded rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of victims in the race doubles with time
The situation has worsened for the survivors.
“It’s all very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and calms her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute a new car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined houses to collect their wealth and goods and to mount everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the employees of the hospitals, who were damaged by the earthquake with the magnitude 7.5, were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who raised vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of persistent strong descendants.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the strong earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and his daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for the stay in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s prayers, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
US ambassadors complain to China of the tyranny with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had turned on a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper, where the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were announced, the US ambassadors in China accused the state capital Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
Last Wednesday, USA Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid supplement in The Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of entering the US Congress elections on November 6, an accusation that China disputes.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to engage in the U.S. marches correspond to the U.S. announcement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn on advertising to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently being turned into an out-of-date trade war, with duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese payrolls at the start of the trade war should meet exporters in countries like Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing had damaged workers, owners of agricultural holdings and businesses.
China, so Branstad, in an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by switching propaganda ads into its own free press in the United States.
"In the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government advocates the tradition of free expression and independent press, by turning off advertising paid by the country in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find only a limited number of votes at the paper kiosks here in Beijing and do not find a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have on China's disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article. However, he did not call the name of the newspaper.
Republicans sell voters in front of the interim elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warns observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the upcoming elections, which could be made by women in particular.
The vote in this connection was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already indicated that they continue to vote.
"That is something you can't do," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute's advance of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation to poison the electorate.
"Do not forget what was yesterday, do not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, as the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called on the Senate's "November is coming," when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to hold the Kavanaughs nomination and, despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political observer on the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even before the Ford's public statement, in which its allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans submitted the confirmation.
"This situation is a backdrop for the GOP," said at the beginning of last week Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee, the final vote or the Kavanaughs review; it is also the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be unconcerned about who they should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitely or probably convinced by Ford’s statement, while 35% indicated that they were definitely or probably giving Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38% indicated that they were of the opinion that Kavanaugh had probably lied or definitively to his statement, while 30% indicated the same about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported, The Guardian.
Ford made a solemn statement last week before the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had disbanded her genitals when she was at a party during her study in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology element, Inrupt, is a company based on the Open Source Platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information they receive.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind inrupt was the "welthership".
"We need to be active now," he said on the topic of Startup.
"It is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other tools for the private and business area.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The particular thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide for himself who can access the data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to CEO of John Bruce, the idea behind imprutt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up to work on this project, as well as a community volunteer programmer. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM comes into use.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change should be made when their entire business model is completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution to the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee provided a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee was heavily involved in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was distinguished as a fighter with the Victorian crusade during the 1st World War, was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his use in attacking Bellenglies and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sharp shield and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
On Sunday, two of his grandchildren were exposed to a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, a memorial stone.
One of the uncles, Michael Vann, thought that this act was full of symbolism, since the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after the hero's date for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918; through thick fog and under heavy fire of cannons and machine guns.
Later, he pushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest daring" before he took out a single-armed field weapon and turned off three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot on 4 October 1918 by a German sharp shield; something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the deeds of his grandfather were something he could never be executed, and at the same time something that would make a humble one.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he placed a crane under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade and added that the bravery of a real hero would be visible mainly by supporting many people.
MMA fans stay awake all night to watch bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been awake all night to watch an exciting bellator 206 and then you can't watch the main event.
The calculation of San Jose included 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not bad when Peppa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remained unaffected after they stayed awake until early in the morning to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the trick film figure as a kind of bad joke.
"Because of a government regulation, these contents are classified as not being youth-free, so that they had to be changed to a children's shipment at 6 p.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication with Bellator, when he was asked about the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will be working on the expiry plan to take into account visitors from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think the problem could have been solved by the game," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. tomorrow at a Sunday with the visitors in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the event until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay inside.
It was very much communicated with each other, and it was not always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have come to the conclusion that it is a technical disturbance.
What wasn't the case was a government problem.
I promise, it won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite sad."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "delay" on the topic of sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being subjected to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old felt that he had only realized at the continuing school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken on the subject of shoulen rights to encourage others.
He also meant that since he became a father, the victory in the Olympic games was no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses illness for a few months.
In the first shipment of Laverne, he said that he earlier viewed himself as inferior in comparison to others, since the love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: “To this day it is the feeling of subjecting others and being different from others, the reason for my power and strength and finally for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person to let no one disappoint when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he expressed himself on this subject because he was fortunately able to live without restrictions and without discrimination and would like to do other courage.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner in the previous year, but he told me that the age difference had never been a topic.
He thinks that if you had to endure so much as a child and young people – he took part 14 for the first time in the Olympics and his father died three years later in cancer, it is hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have had a son who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley thinks that his whole view has changed since then.
Even in the last year, everything had turned around with him for gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same names as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the brain tumor diagnosis.
Daley said that his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London in 2012, as he wanted to be with it in advance.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that it became absolutely clear to me that he is not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in Olympic games in front of the home audience – that was the nonsense," he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and still cared for Gänsehaut.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, is sitting at Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to work very hard not to make the whole thing a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays at the 12th time event, was sent to the replacement bank on Saturday by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the event, the five-year-old Major spent his day in fire and work at his game, hoping to solve the problems he was facing.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mikkelson was never the directest golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where missing balls are regularly punished.
And as if the space itself wasn't encouraging enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game on Sunday at the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points left behind in the 12 individual games a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in Mikkelson and could not add it much.
"He was perfectly aware of his current role in clearing, gave me a slap on my back and laid his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has quite a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the well-known personalities worldwide and has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had introduced myself more, but that's how it's been and that's what we've been expecting.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that never fully matched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson was able to record 18 wins, had to insert 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Fury announced that his presence had already enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and he likes to make a few lates, and he's a great man who's popular with the whole team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He's a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that with the advantage it can be over soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last individual games in Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points against the Americans, but only came just over the target line and led with the slightest lead and won a victory of 141 1⁄2–13 1⁄2.
“The thought remains that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we have won, but just that,” said Bjørn (pictured on the photo), after seeing the victory 5–3 of the class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
It's gonna be okay tomorrow.
Put yourself in the suit and do exactly the right thing.
The whole is only over when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're all about explaining what's going on on the other side: the best players in the world."
Glad about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never break it.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
In the morning, the individual services are in the foreground and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're alone out there, then you'll be tested as a golfer up to the limits of his abilities.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you let your partner behind you and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will note that his players cut off each other better than the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big turn on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brooklyn on the winning side before he stood on the sides of the losers after Europe's "Wonder of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the fast start you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the moment hits a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of taking the challenge, he has to join Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the ranking list.
"I have decided for the boys in this order, because I believe it covers everything," Bjorn said about his choice for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship again delayed
The latest fregatts of the German Navy were to be put in service in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War that came in the years. However, according to local media, they will be delivered due to faulty systems and fast growing costs first year.
The launch of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the lead ship of the brand new fregats of the ‘Baden-Württemberg’ class, has now been moved to the first half of 2019 according to the time it took on a military speaker.
The ship would have been put into service already in 2014, but the ambitious project of disturbing problems after delivery was planned.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Marine in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a number of air rockets and sea target bodies, as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic flexion.
Another important feature is longer maintenance times. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delays can lead to the old-fashioned warships, which Germany is supposed to represent as a vessel, will already be obsolete at the time of its launch, as the weather says.
The F125 Fregate, which was followed by the accident, is driving into the battle lines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned to Hamburg by Werft Blohm & Voss.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, however, German media called a series of significant "software and hardware errors", which made the new ship useless in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by an occupation of only 120 mattresses, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out any disarmament measures in the future.
The 7,000-tonne heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the cost of the whole project, including the training costs of the occupation, was also a problem.
It appears that the costs increased to €3.1 billion, compared to the original planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregats are particularly important in view of the latest warnings that the vessel will collapse Germany.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartel, German-based military commander, confirmed that the Navy "is going out of service".
Bartels said that the problem with time was increased, since old ships were taken apart from service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Marine.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the bat
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are being carried out to show how Fledermäuse uses the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to promote future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will be carried out by two-and-a-half-year-olds as well as the Brown Langohr and Waterfeds in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the plot to record the activities of the bat during the whole season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with portable detectors.
In an analysis of the noise of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the fluebermouse calls is determined and determined which species does what.
Then a map and a report of the living space will be created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Consultant, hopes that the results will show what areas of life for the bats are most important and how they are used by each species.
These data will help determine the benefits of measures to manage the living space, such as the creation of meadows, and show how forest areas can be obtained for bats and other related species.
Flemish stocks in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect sleeping places and lead to loss of living space.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flyers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Fledermuses are not really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching bees.
They use a failed escort to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in all of Scotland, takes the theme of the floodhouse very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who carry out regular surveys, sleep inspection and sometimes rescue measures.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, the home for eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Good manager David Thompson explains that the possession of the ideal living space is for her.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living room.
But there are many things we don't know yet about bats, so here and in other things we're doing these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel well."
He stresses how important it is to exclude the presence of bats from maintenance work in the goods first, since it is possible that the accidental destruction of a single nest site would kill up to 400 females and young animals and destroy the entire population on the spot.
Fledermuses are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to harass them or to destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
She explains: “We still need to learn much about bats and in many of our species we don’t know how their populations are.”
Ronaldo argues about rape, while his lawyers want to complain about the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to the allegations of rape against him as "Fake News" and said that people would like to be "recognised" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to appeal to the news magazine The Mirror, which published the charges.
The stormer of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375.000 to buy her silence on the occasion, as Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to its 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their release as "Fake News."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to be profiled by the use of my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to appeal to the mirror on the basis of the accusations they claim to be “an illegal report on suspicions in the field of privacy, ” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the legal infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged event was to take place in 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they had met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room where he reportedly raped them documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "99 percent a good guy", which was the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it was compatible.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later admitted to an extrajudicial agreement, since she had “fear before revenge” and was concerned about being“publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to lift the agreement, as she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was just about to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged event and changed this summer into a 100 million Euro heavy deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “persevere” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "never regret" if it lost its status as a world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production in the work in Burnaston at Derby, the UK should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays on the border could lead to loss of jobs in a no-deal brexit.
The work in Burnaston, in which Toyota's product line Auris and Avensis are produced, last year, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops at an uncontrolled Brexit End March in our work," says Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyotas in Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also allowed fears about a hard EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its mini work in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns depend on the car manufacturer's involvement with risks within the supply chain at a hard Brexit.
Toyotas manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the United Kingdom and the EU in order to produce the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could break the limits that could lead the industry to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to carry a stock in the work in Derbyshire which lasted longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers' plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such controls at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I have already said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he explained in the BBC Radio 4 today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful delivery chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the highest official of the United Nations, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience never comes back when they are just gone.
One government speaker said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's scheduled meetings with Rosenstein could be moved again according to White House data
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be moved "for another week", while the dispute over the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, it was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has examined the supervision of the work of the Special Ombudsman Robert Mueller, who investigates the wave mixtures through Russia, the connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as a possible impediment to justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Minister of Justice and thereby endanger the independence of Mueller has been the subject of reports in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had the opportunity to record his secret talks with Trump as well as the President's meeting with the addition of the 25th Constitution.
Rosenstein dismissed the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his likely retreat were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump said he would not let it go Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to prevent him from collaborating with the hearing before the U.S. Senate's judicial committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, said.
On Friday Trump arranged a one-week FBI investigation of the proposals against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
She answered a question about meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be moved for another week, given all the things that go directly with the Supreme Court.
This will show up, but I always like to keep the press on the run."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences did not lie at a tendency towards the TV reporter's "effect-hashing" but added: "But I would not argue that they operate effect-hashing."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more questions and answers rounds than any president before him," she said, without giving specific evidence: "We have seen these figures."
There will still be press conferences, so Sanders, however, be “when the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly but far better than to talk to me.
We often try to do this, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he performed a bizarre performance in front of assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes due to Brexit's concerns about EU workers of the Scottish NHS
The Ministry of Health appeals to persons from the EU abroad who work in Scotland National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express the wish that they remain in the country even after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British government has also reinforced the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I contribute to the value of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is full and full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christian Abercrombie was subjected to a head injury
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie was reportedly subjected to a notooperation by Mike Organ of Tennessee State following a head injury that he suffered on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, explained to reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life break.
"He came to the side line and just broke up there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel provided Abercrombie on the oxygen side line before being placed on a ladder and transported for further investigations.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the OP in the Vanderbild Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details of the nature or extent of the injury” and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in its first season at Tennessee State after changing over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tattles, thus increasing his total number in the season to 18 tattles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax in the future for the purchase of properties in the United Kingdom. The additional revenues will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party without delay.
This step is intended to end the success of Jeremy Corby's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will be all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance estimates additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May today will announce that foreign investors need to pay a higher stamp fee when you buy properties in the United Kingdom, with the benefit of more income without covering.
This step represents an attempt to dampen Jeremy Corby's success with young voters, who promises to provide more affordable living space and take top valuers to the visa.
The increase in stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second-hand dwellings and the rental of residential property, the increase could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is counting by the step with additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not located in the United Kingdom. Thus, prices are driven up and it will be more difficult for first-time buyers to get into the real estate business.
Many well-being areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become 'beneficial cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke for a reduction in stamp tax to allow more young people to first own their own home.
He accused construction companies of holding the real estate prices by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end the British “dwelling” scandal.”
The opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular series of proposals for residential reforms ranging from a rental price bond to the ban of rooms without valid grounds.
He also wants to offer city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May stated: “Last year, I said that I would devote my time as prime minister of the restoration of the British dream, according to which the life of a generation should be improved.
And that means repairing our broken apartment market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as it is for companies based abroad to buy properties as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too distant for too many people and the worthlessness of unhappiness continues to be too great a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says it was his “greatest goal” to ever become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Shot has the challenge of raising the club from the north-east of England to a new life, which is just in the third place in the League One and lacks three points to the top.
He took this summer to the stadium of Light after taking St. Mirren back in the last season to the first Scottish league.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and it was’s,” said Ross of BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound.
“But I’ve seen as a child with my father often playing Scotland in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in the management of the association."
Ross's predecessors as the manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said not to be afraid to enter the steps of such established names at such a club after he previously rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment if I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this association, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would appreciate my time here only as a success if I brought the association back there."
Ross can have a first three-year management career, after a phase as deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he now feels better than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real path," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny, because I didn't make a bad job, I could live well of it, and I had some very pleasant high-phase experiences.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I'm still doing this with regard to stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I do it. I've never felt like an adult in my skin in my whole life."

The perfect time for a glass beer is Saturday at 17:30, so a study
The heat wave in the summer missed the revenues of British crystal pubs, while restaurant chains ran under greater pressure.
In July, public and bar companies recorded a sales growth of 2.7 percent. However, the revenues at the restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the company council of CGA, who compiled the figures, stated: “Containing sunlights and England longer than expected permanent participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of previous June, in which Pub's sales increased by 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant found it even more difficult.
The fall of 1.8 percent, recorded by the restaurant industry in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed the best performance at a distance, with a flat-adjusted sales development that rose higher than they dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs focused on food in the sun as well, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the rate of drinking increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the food supply decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from the analysts for the RSM leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors for sales in the Out-of-Home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to have problems, but sales revenues of 4.8 per cent over the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have reached a worse time for business operators with a focus on food, and it remains to be expected that the more consistent temperatures will be provided with the necessary atempauses in August."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, accounted for 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The Sector Exchange Monitor Coffer Peak Tracker for the Pub, Bar and Restaurant area in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media, which it hides from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some once 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
An survey of 20,000 students in higher education has found an increase in the so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students indicated having a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates social media accounts that can keep it secret from adults.
An survey of 20,000 students in continuing schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, an introduction to the Photo-Sharing website Instagram.
The message fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students indicated having a clean "main account" that they could show their parents, but also own private accounts.
A mother, who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged the other to "violate me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half adding to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being driven to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Elid Doyle will be the "vote of the athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
At its annual General Meeting, Elid Doyle was elected as a non-executive member in the Council of the Scottish Litigation Association of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most outstanding light athletes and President Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid is respected in the light athletes community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that light athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I am happy to act as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a distance of over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympics in Atlanta, called his own four Olympic gold medals, and today often appears as BBC experts, could no longer run after a temporary bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me if or how far I'm going to be healed.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and make movement exercises today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!"
An advertising for milk pumps that compare mothers to cows provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement with a advertising clip in which the still mother is compared to the milk of cows.
In order to launch the market, according to its own definition, "the first soundproofed milk pump" published by the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie a non-serious music video to highlight the freedom that the pump gives to silent mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a bowl filled with cows in the background to a song containing the lines of text like: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see me with a hook" or "if you haven't noticed it, it's not yours but my breasts."
In the refrain it goes on to say: “Pump it out, pump it out, feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladyes.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video focused on mixed reactions among audiences, many of whom say it is harmless to the "freaks" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
As we do, they must become pregnant and bring a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within less days of birth," said one comment.
The milk pump of Elvie fits in a still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Recognizable traumatically for mothers and babies.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: “So a strange advertising.”
Others defended the advertising and a woman added that you found the song "urcomical".
“I find that to be a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if I'd still be quiet.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to reinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertising aimed at mothers using milk pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like “Cows”.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps show themselves to feel like milk cows.
However, the pump of Elvie is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still-BH, allowing women to get the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, stated: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a bold and provocative market introduction.
Through the comparison of still mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to raise milk pumps and all the challenges associated with this, and at the same time, in a entertaining and tangible way, to present the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump runs into the battle lines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the catwalk while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrants were brought quietly and quietly to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of internally displaced children is as high as ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, including the increased rhetoric and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to bring children under care.
Traditionally, most administrators were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become the target disc for a demonstration when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when the Federal authorities announced that potential managers and other adult members of their household should print their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Customs Force, announced before the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had complained about the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no previous entry into the criminal register.
“Almost 80 per cent of the persons who are either a manager or a member of a household of a manager are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," Albence explained.
In order to be able to process the cases of children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules which, according to employees of the accommodation in some children, required to appear within a month instead of 60 days after the court hearing, which was the standard.
Many will not appear personally by video switch to join an immigration court for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person is quickly dismissed.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more likely it is according to the information provided by the accommodation staff and reports that have been announced from the system in the last month that they are afraid and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced by a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there signs that a child has problems will be more easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that traumata, which many of the children are already suffering, could be strengthened if they are brought into a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to make their own decisions with friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “Employment troops” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in eight years.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, explained that the foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian ground against the pretext of the fight against terrorism and were "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war against terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are clean" both by terrorist groups and by "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has stationed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish fighters and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-sponsored country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return had been met and he accused "some western countries" of spreading "Irrational fears", which prevented refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable the return to their homes," he said.
"They are in fact policing a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition in order to end the war.
The UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel capital Idlib represents the opportunity for political talks to take place.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province in which three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action against the Shihadites, including combatants of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, would be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee, which consists of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to "recasting the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, conclude an official assembly or a scandal his presidency will soon end.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidency of all times".
So far, there are no signs that the viewers have been sitting.
Since 2014, the rate of turnover for the best transmission time at CNN has doubled to 1.05 million more than doubled and at MSNBC to 1.6 million almost dispersal.
According to Nielsen, Fox News achieves an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best time to send, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBCs "The Rachel Maddow Show" conducted the auction rates with up to 3.5 million viewers at evenings with important news.
"It's like a fire that magically attracts people, as it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, Showrunner of the drama series "Designed Survivor" on TV broadcast on a cabinet member, who will be the president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She recalls a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
The chaos has value of entertainment.
Of course, the stories from Washington can, in contrast to anything on TV, determine the future of the principle decision on deductions Roe v. Wade, the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet there is also to be an informed citizen, if one is aware of having already seen six hours of an expert round that Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fare", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket from Strausßenleder (according to Washington Post, "a piece of clothing rich in self-esteem") or discussing the effects of Stormy Daniel's rich description of Trumps, emm, anatomy.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see with the same eyes again.
“A part of what he does can be felt like a reality show that he presides over every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus”, about Trump’s rotating occupation and daily performances (a fight with the football league NFL from the zoo, Kim Jong-un prizes).
You can't afford to miss a result, or you can't come with it anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, there were 27 degrees ahead of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he broke in and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn't get out of the screen, not when Judge Brett Kavanaugh was just ahead of the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy missions and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was kind of a joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Donations of cash flow through the tightest races at the congress at the mid-elections
It is a little surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral district, which led to two officials standing in the race around the same seat.
The recently re-designed Pre-City Bezirk in Pittsburg allows the Democratic Conor Lamb to take place, who won his seat in another district during a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb acts against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overcrowded with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the decision by the State's Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old districts were opposed to the Constitution and were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district led to a victory exchange of electoral funding between the parties' large financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was announced in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th election district of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and won a 20-percent jump there.
Political experts hold the democrats in a light direction.
The United States examined the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then returned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized, without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama to partner the Trump's management team.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. overseas representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the latest decisions not to recognise Taiwan any longer", says Heather Nauert, speaker of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, a criminal measure estimated $140 million in 2017 was considered for US aid, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed criminal measures, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder.
While internal meetings were moving forward, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic well-being, which should follow a similar assembly in the previous year and represent a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the USA.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made it clear that they wished the conference to be held and thus effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a speaker at the conference in mid-October to give a sign according to diplomats to the importance that the government of the assembly may receive.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silent and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new tight communications or sanctions from Washington.
One spokesperson for John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal discussions subject to anonymity.
Their opinions were confirmed by one of the government's close external analysts, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From the History
The next big surprise could be the report of Special Agent Robert Mueller on Trump's possible injustice for which there are now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now allegedly also investigating whether Trump's election team has been conspiring with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the majority of the Congress changes, Trump will face an organ that forces him to account, and that is exactly when he prepares to go back to the voters; and perhaps before a jury.
That is a lot of 'cause' and I do not want to say that the Donald Trumps case, or his European pendant, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 German officers were ready to execute a state strike against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of Barbara who followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unsustainable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do when Trump dismisses Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, so the man who decides about the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been driving in Teufel's kitchen since last year's newspaper reported that he proposed to record the presidents secretly and speculated about it, although it was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein neglects the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair or is confirmed despite the alleged allegations of sexual abuse and misdemeanour in the office?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections for a congress that forces the trumpet to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead.
But I think we're not going to fail because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to burn Sabbath candles on the table with the hooker.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimisticly in front of the game against Vienna
The rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remis against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will move them into a good position for the qualification of the Group G of Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not get into appearance up to the 2-2 level against Villareal, but he believes that the rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for larger sizes.
"That was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we're going home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but a total decision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we insisted in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, however, this will be a difficult party, as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through it with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a kind of feeling factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of old age leads women to sleepless nights.
Although the surveyers knew exactly how to care for them, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the female participants in the nationwide study reported talking to your marriage partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Insurance Department.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in a timely manner.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be treated, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your consultant can also help you find an opportunity to finance these expenditures.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional maintenance insurance, hybrid life-forming insurance to help cover these costs or self-assurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Apply legal disputes in the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you can entrust a trusted person with the task of monitoring your medical care and ensuring that health professionals meet your wishes, you should be able to express this yourself.
Consider also a full power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about taking medicines or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so you are ready.
"Not only the financial questions play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

Men in Ilfracombe several times with air defence
A man was shot several times with a gun when he went home after work with friends.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials describe the shots that occurred at around 02:30 British time as "willful act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, so the authorities were allowed to increase the number of deaths.
Because of the resulting communication systems, aid forces were not able to obtain information from the government district of Dongalla, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the magnitude 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary just as the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a county in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi, located over a coastal area of over 300 km (180 miles) long.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, lived in 2017 estimated 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the Central-Sulawesis economy, in particular for the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickellabbau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to Indonesia’s disaster protection authority, Palu and Dongala have been the victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
West Dongala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Ring, and is regularly sought by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the North Sumatra opened on 26 December a tsunami that hit 14 countries and cost the lives of 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with the magnitude of 6,8 shook south Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and called for nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake with the strength of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the magnitude of 7.5 killed one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the government district Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no Tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died through broken buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indian island Lombok, popular with tourists, and in particular called for over 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The dam destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached on the island.
Sarah Palin's son was arrested for allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaska and former candidates for the Vice-President's office, was arrested on the grounds of allegations of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, the impediment to the notification of domestic violence and the resistance to State violence, such as a report published by the Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone when she wanted to understand the police.
Palin, according to KTUU, is under investigation in the Mat-Su Preterial Facility and a deposit of $500 has been raised.
He appeared on Saturday before the court, where he, when asked for his petitioner, replied with "no guilt, absolutely sure", so the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three legal objections to Class A, which can be charged with up to a year of imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He will also be charged with a class B legal objection, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin's criminal shows were picked up.
In December 2017 he was asked to have attacked his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was subjected to domestic violence, a violation of the notification of a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend suggested that you beat her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran organisations after returning her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami by Earthquakes in Indonesia: one hundred dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The bee with a magnitude of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communications networks are interrupted and it is expected that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake was just ahead of the Central-Sulawesis coast, which is located north-east of the capital Jakarta of Indonesia.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terror Attack
The federal prosecutor in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack of New York City, who cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has been suspended for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he ran on a bike along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October and carried pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “targeted” and “consciously” seriously injured the body, that is, in the declaration of intent to demand the death penalty lodged in the south of New York.
Both charges could be punishable by death according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court of inquiry, Saipov, filed a indictment in 22 points, covering eight counts of the murder in front of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "fundamental planning and purpose", the prosecutors who described the nature of the action in Saipov as "disgusting, cruel and debauched".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and loss," said the statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the South District of New York had no longer been pursuing a case with the aim of calling for the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York at a federal crime was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been accused of swearing two years earlier to commit espionage to the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were furnished on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months following the attack of missing reue, so to speak.
He told me before the investigators that he felt good about what he did, so the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was actually inspired after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, so the indictment.
He also called for police reports to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, explained that they were "depressed of course" because of the decision of the State Prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to call for the death penalty instead of a debt in exchange for a life-long liberty penalty without accepting the possibility of release, the trauma that will only be extended by all the parties involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party asks NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest at the Tories Conference.
Ukip's former leader stated that politicians "must feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative back banker Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be outside" if Farage Brexit was minister.
The challenge facing May in the reconciliation of its deeply controversial party was reinforced by the fact that members of your party who are for a stay in the EU participated in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems in keeping her Cheques' compromise plan in spite of attacks from Brexit supporters, Brexit generators and the EU on course.
They agreed that despite their reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the chaos.
Bone explained at the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “Checkers belong to the garbage”.
He suggested that Farage be named a peer and that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible for this, we would already be out," he explained.
The Commissioner of Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but Cheques belongs to the mine.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that the public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Brexit's deputy of the conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists, who actually walk through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please enter cheques and start listening.’
In a final message in May, she continued: “The Prime Minister will keep her jobs if you keep her promises.”
Farage stated in a statement that politicians need to “taste the pressure”, they should be in the process of misleading the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political class”, said Farage.
“They are trying to cheat the Brexit and that’s why we are here today to say to them, ‘You don’t come from it’.
He continued: “I want you to let our political class, who is just before betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will give us victory in the referendum and never come to peace, unless we are an independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before they had a two-hour broadcast in the city center.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit Group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, who were called to life at the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, was making fun of the Tories that had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all technology for Canada Plus, are available for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
"That's a farce.
There's just no good Brexit," he added.
Warren planned to “review” the presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that after the elections in November, she would "examine the presidential candidacy".
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is currently running for the re-election of the Senate against the Republican MPs in the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of Trump's election team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculations that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was since Trump's entry into office her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the persons present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that for women at the time it would be "to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after shooting at LSU player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested from Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 o'clock in the morning of Eastern Time.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the shots.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury on his head and died as a result of this injury," reported the sports media portal 247 sports officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday told the media.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and given to have been on the roof and possession of a weapon and to have shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Great price of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Stallorder from Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the Pole position, Botta's success was a good start, and it was almost as he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and introduced vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton enter the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind the Vettel, but he was caught by Hamilton after a button of wheel-an-rad-manover, where the Ferrari pilot pushed the inside to take the risk of two movements in order to defend the third curve.
Max disappeared on one of the back squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round seven in place.
He was then for most of the race of the fastest, as he kept on his tires to finish quickly and pick up Kimi raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally went into the box in round 44 and did not make it possible to take a step in the remaining eight rounds while raikkonen ended up as a fourth.
It was a difficult day since Valteri had been doing an excellent job all weekend and how a genuine gentleman had acted when he should have let me go.
The team has done excellent work to win a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of this Saturday's election event about Senator Diane Feinstein, who insisted that Christine Blasey Ford, in which he, a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, would not have given the press sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement addressed the Senate's Justice Committee not directly, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are "common, wicked and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and angry and angry and mean and unseemly," said the President.
“If you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, that wasn’t me.
I wasn't."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, one moment, please.
If we... no, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein was awarded the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and it was published at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein argues that the body comes from its office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," said Feinstein, according to information from The Hill to the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I replied to her request for confidentiality."
Your dementia did not seem to be good with the President, who said on Saturday evening at the election: “I tell you one thing, it was a very bad language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the judge's candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the Democrats would use the charges for their own sake.
‘They are determined to regain the power by all means.
One sees the community, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt when they leave under the wheels to get power and control," said the President Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer reached two gates for the giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants through a 5:3 win in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The giants went early with two doors leading, after meetings of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie provided compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the giants.
Francois Bouchard just went out for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory with two towers.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe who beat Dundee on Friday night 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the giant winning the three previous parties.
Dwyer's opening tower took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaul. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the presentation, as Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie moved to its balance store after 15:16 minutes.

Airplane died after he made sure that hundreds of people in a plane escaped the earthquake
An airplane in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death in order to secure the launch of a plane with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people die and many are lost after the island of Sulawesi was scared on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong remnants are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped under drums in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his posts in the highly swinging control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
It remained to be sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was then on the runway, could safely depart.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Major died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirat, spokesperson for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to several thousand. The disaster protection authority of the country stated that access to the cities of Dongalla, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the drums, while others cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are sprayed all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is about to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and stated in an address to the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to carry out all the tasks involved in evacuation.
You've been ready?" So CNN.
Indonesia was already shot this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports from a missing aircraft crash in Laguna
The airline, which conducted the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports from a missing person after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the occupation were safe from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they could not say anything until Saturday afternoon about the stay of a passenger.
The airline indicated to work with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane was pushed into the water when attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that on Saturday there were six passengers in the hospital, but were in a stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed shortly before the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was out of the ground.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane hit very flat.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others could swim through deep water to the emergency exits on the side of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that mattresses, which worked near the improvement of an installation, used a blower boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane fell in about 30 metres (100 feet) deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 people have died in ruins of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affect Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded its evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man was proposed to have banned a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the US Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he, using phone calls, rebuilt the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her night of death.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers at the night of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, so the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he indicated to be at his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the stand on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he indicated to have been at Sanford's Pick-Up this night, Sandford said he had lied, "when my Pick-Up was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis indicated to have known Chambers at their death point for two weeks.
But phone records showed that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis released some time after Chamber's death their messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took them out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will likely begin on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure is then before the jury on that day.

The High Breed from Bristol claimed that Hip Hop had removed himself from his roots of the political message and social commitment.
They want to go back to his roots and make hip hop socially conscious again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance by artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black?!
New Yorker girls couple complained about a dismissal after "racist" SMS
A New York girl complained to a couple because of a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong message from her mother, in which she complained that she was "not yet a black woman".
The couple argues to be racist and compared to a 'pression'.
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her frustration when she found out that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she entered her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEIEN, ANOTHER VERSION," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this message to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her Fauxpass, she dismissed the "painty-affected" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice and claimed that the unopened African-American-day mother had done a bad job and had waited for a Filipino instead, so the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice has charged the couple with compensation for the dismissal and makes a claim for compensation for the $350 per day, which she should last over six months, the job for which she was originally booked, but without contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look what you're not doing," she said on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple turned back the racist proposals, and argued that the release of the sensible step was no longer possible because they feared Maurice after they had offended her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained Ehemann Joel Plasco of the Post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was unfair to them, even if it was out of proportion?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal dispute with an "expression" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“Do you want to interest such a person?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly convicted in the public and pressured on the social media, where they were criticized for their conduct and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It is difficult to move into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our today's knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, no problem with it, would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death in the last year was "bitter sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as “very important family member”.
"He was a very quiet man and didn't cry," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that makes something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success this way.
Although he invented it and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died, and I had to accept her over the phone.
After the country, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors deliberately tried to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors allowed her little chances,” said Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to agree with her.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications you have given the doctors to keep their heart on the pump, they cry slowly and leave their body.
She had just died, and that was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't wait to do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
After all, Ednan-Laperous, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who didn't get anything from what she was doing on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had fallen my head and tears all the time over the waves.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their family through a suicide attempt to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers for consulting points.
Davis Son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he started suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel like I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had a burning smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could bring a room to light."
However, he announced his job before his death, since he was “in a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I always fear that this could have an effect."
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people to whom one can go and who one can talk even if he is a friend.
Don't be quiet: you need to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the bottom of the well on Christmas Day, and when the children took their gifts out, he did not see them in his eyes or anything."
She said that her death was a great trauma to her, but that she had to go through it: “It’s a huge hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the Sweep while the FBI starts with investigations
"I thought that if we could actually get something like this which he asked, so a temporary and limited investigation, we might get a little insight," Flake said on Saturday. He feared that the committee in the partisan state of "external break".
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Your will can only be returned to the timing.
The elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut down badly as expected, then they would be significantly weak in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush contacted the phone operator to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide in equality of vote, and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean crossings “low” under Kim
The number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has fallen to power since Kim Jong-and seven years ago, such as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which is based on data from the South Korean Reunition Ministry, stated that last year 1127 crossings were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers than major factors.
Pjöngang did not express himself publicly.
The overwhelming majority of the crossings from the north are finally offered to the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean war in 1953 over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most fly across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the crossings to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pjöngang to discuss the agreed denuclearisation negotiations.
As a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mr Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not fit for the office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the representative's house Nancy Pelosi called court candidates Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was particularly unfit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted as such would have been referred to as “hysterical”, Pelosi said about her reaction to the statement of Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emboldened in an emotional way all the charges that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed almost and stood out in tears shortly before speaking of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the charges against him a "great and coordinated reputation" organised by Liberals, who were furious about the losing presidential election of Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because she showed that he was ahead of the Democrats.
"I believe that he has explained himself with these statements and the way in which he came up with the Clintons and the Democrats, even without delay," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to extract Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also inappropriate for his current court posts," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the decision to withdraw Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, pre-eminent person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘I’m not wonderful’, says Pelosi.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger, and it does not get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager and said that she was also crying when she got angry but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts to cry, tell her to the person she said: “They may think that I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was great."
Tranches are permitted as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearer memories is to a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I wept because of an indescribable anger and by an older woman, a cold manager, before whom I was always a little afraid, was packed into a closet.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
“You don’t know that you’re tinkering.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy with you because they think you've gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was acquired on board a ship named Monkey Business in an exceptional affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder wondered that there was no reason to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy itself.
"That was not a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snowwittchen and the seven twins’.
As the election campaign had already progressed, she was behind the middle purchase and she swore not to run if she was not supposed to get $2 million together.
It was a searchless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who spent $1,000, supported their campaign only with $250.
"Do you think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to start an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system, which made the procurement and direct address of the voters so difficult instead of the delegates, and the anger about sexism, so overwhelming that she stood close to the tears.
"You could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the bag manufacturer Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my gravestone.

Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China were horrifying. Although the battle has not been long past, Beijing could benefit from a dig between the countries in the long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, fired the first warning panel at the beginning of the year when he presented important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with fines.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new fines on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China into the USA.
Peking returned in the same way every time and recently collected a fine of between five and ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has vowed to respond to any US measure and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon be subdued.
To move Washington to join, would mean to give up, but a public insight towards the United States would be too much fun for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, my experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is in fact much more dangerous than many observers have known before," says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security at the memorial plant.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, so the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the war over seven years.
In an address before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the circumstances in the country improve.
"Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and more secure," he explained.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to reverse normality.
All conditions have now been given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily and life-saving grounds.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that there would be no acceptance of conditional assistance from countries that had supported the rebellion.
Europe won a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA with an end of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points that needed it to defeat the United States.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems about most of the tournament, reduced his strike on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and became one of 4 players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit at 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win back the Pokal.
It is about the team and I am happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues to reach his countryman John Rahm, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods in the individual encounters on Sunday 2:1.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I've been watching on TV since my childhood," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A remarkable statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, which has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had to find the fairways all week long, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have performed high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time tomorrow when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hut for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players gave up a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
