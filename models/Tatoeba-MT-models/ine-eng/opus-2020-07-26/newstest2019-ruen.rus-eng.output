Named after the number of trainees who are ready to go to Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People's Police of the self-proclaimed Lugan People's Republic (LNR) said that in winter 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass.
According to him, thus, Kiev plans "to do something to complete the units".
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of Ukraine's VCs has led to a low level of disengagement," said Marochko, quoted by the RIA News.
He also did not rule out that real figures for the Ukrainian army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev began a so-called anti-terrorism operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces (MOP).
This measure was expected to enhance the role of Ukrainian silhouettes in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasse was exacerbated by the murder of the head of the DNR Aleksandra Zachchenko.
The DNA authorities qualified as a terrorist.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to the preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by Ukrainian special services.

The head of British media compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
The British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the Euro Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of arresting member countries of the Community.
A diplomat made such a statement at the meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to belief in a European dream and its ideals?
The EU was set up to protect freedom and the Soviet Union had not allowed anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from the community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only loser who wants to escape the prison," the Minister said.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue remains open on the Irish border.

Ilon Mask is forced to leave the post of Chief of the Board of Directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Mask have settled their dispute on fraud.
That's what CNBC News reports.
According to the telecanal, the arrangements reached in Moscow require that the head of the Board of Directors of Tesla be left behind.
The Commission has thus allowed Moscow to retain the position of Head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be taken with Tesla.
In this way, money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American entrepreneur, listed by the 50 richest people on the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX Space Corporation, the Neurotechnological Company of Neurolink and the Tesla electrician developer, as well as the founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Stock Exchange Commission had previously brought to the court the Director General of Tesla Ilon Maska for his statement on the possible purchase of the company on Twitter.
Last month, Moscow announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock in $420 was reported "because of the importance of this figure in the marijuana culture", Bloomberg said earlier with reference to the co-director of the Commission's Security Division, Stephen Peykin.
However, Ilon Mask subsequently refused to buy shares.
Commenting on the claim made against him by the US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the charges of fraud unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and concerned about these claims.
"Frequentness is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn't break it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective complaint against Moscow, complaining about the financial losses suffered.
The complainants claimed that the businessmen’s posts had been damaged.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the tweets were misleading and that Tesla stock sellers were forced to buy paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that the unwarranted statements of Ilon Maska had led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Maska accused even the head of the Citron Research research company.
In the meantime, if Moscow could not settle its dispute with the US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission, it would be in danger of being removed from company management and even prison.
In particular, CNBC's former chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission stated that this was the case.
The mask is a "bad guy who can't run a car company."
"Real" on his field couldn't play Atlético.

In the RPC, the possible renaming of the PPC compared with the actions of fascists
The head of the Division of External Church Liaisons (OTCS) of the Moscow Patriarchate Mittropolit Volocolamski Ilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists in Germany.
Metropolit Volocolamsky Ilarion - about the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate, possible church division and its political subtext
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at a sharp pace”, the name of the church is just as much as in Fascist Germany, “to attract Jews to the yellow hexagonal star”.
"This means marking the church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose this bill was established," said a representative of the RPC in the Russian telecanal.
Mitropolit also stressed that the UPC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian, because "the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are the patriots of their country".
UPC called on Constantinople exiles to leave its territory
Gran-pri in Sochi: Anglag, Russian Bolid and Return of Quetta
For the next ten years, a gonorrhea can occur in Russia.
RF Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri Kozak said this by holding a meeting with Russian automakers before the launch of Gran-pri Russia in Sochi.
The Vice-President of the Government also shared his views on the return of Daniel Quetta to Toro Rosso and assessed the visit of the Russian Formula-1 phase.
As a result of our meeting with automakers, it must be a clear future for the creation of the Russian Formula-1 ball, which has no similarities in the world, Dmitri Kozak said.
We must encourage our car manufacturers in this direction.
It was a plan by 2024, but I don't think it's possible at that time.
I think more real time is in the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the "Formule-1" under the Russian license was the "Marusa" team.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors who are willing to invest in the creation of a national team at the World Championship on Roads in Formula-1.
I know that in Russia there are lovers of motor sports, state-of-the-art businessmen who are willing to invest, willing to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula-1 team, he noted.
"We are willing to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that ideas about the establishment of a team appeared, including because Sochi had such an infrastructure."
Tomorrow's "Socie Autodrome" is waiting for an angel.
According to Dmitria Kozak, the organizers have managed to deliver all 50,000 tickets.
See, even the Tribunal's qualifications were practically filled, the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
I can say that this year's yield rose by 72 per cent compared to last year.
That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing a plan of action to improve the efficiency of the face-to-face infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will add even more attractiveness to Sochi.
Dmitry Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian car lovers was the return of Daniel Quetta to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season, Vice-President of the Reports.
He is the Great, the Great, the Owner of hope.
The next year, the first time in the history of the Formula-1 pilot will be able to participate immediately in two major Russian pilots.
Although Sergei Sirotkin's further fate in the Coral Races is still unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took the 18th place in the qualifications of Gran Pri Russia.
We hope that next season our main pilots will be more than this year," Dmitri Kozak said.

The opening of the penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming world glory and made it the Nobel laureate.
In fact, the release of penicillin from dance mushrooms was not the first opening of Fleming.
A few years earlier, he had sown a tear from his own nose at Peter’s cup (a glass of water that had experience with bacteria) and had found that the bacteria were destroyed in a few days.
In a similar way, penicillin was found.
The name Fleming has been added to the list of the 100 most outstanding persons in human history.
Its opening has, in the opinion of many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the earlier diseases, previously considered untreated, tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspaper wrote: "For the collapse of fascism and liberation of France he did more than ten divisions".
According to experts, the discovery of Fleming's first world antibiotic has saved more than 200 million inhabitants of the Earth.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from heart attack.

Trump told about "love" in Kim Chen Yn
From the harshness of the U.S. leaders and the Canadians, it was hardly a matter of falling in love with each other that Donald Trump was joking.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, noted the success of his efforts at the North Korean crisis resolution.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries now have so much relations that they are hardly in love with each other, the President of the United States said.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had taken the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so much to do with the CDR that she could not even call the country's leadership - they just didn't take the tube.
At that time, the United States and the Canadians were at the threshold of war, and today the North Korean leader writes in the White House "pretty letters", Trump noted.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also "worse" to Kim Chen Inn, which, by the way, was mutual.
But now their relationship has improved so much that leaders have “in love with one another”.
However, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that American media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that Peñayan had recently stopped nuclear and missile testing, as well as closed military sites.
All of this is the merit of his administration, a certain American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump referred to Kim Chen Yne as a member of the UN Genassembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to descale tension.
However, Trump noted that sanctions against the PRC would remain until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

However, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still being taken.
The media reported that several disarmament scenarios had already been sent to the CDR since the United States Singapore Summit, but Phanyan rejected them, calling them "gangster".

Nicao called for "Moscow language by Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian children's novelist and linguist, Larissa Nice, called on Ukraine to extract the Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language.
To do this, she proposes a Ukrainian product, "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
In his comments on "the purpose of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine", Nice shared with the Ukrainian edition "Observator".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - even already exists and continues to develop further.
In time, the Ukrainians will be "healing" from this "Moscow language", she's convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that the Russian word had been widely used on television and radio before, but it had not remained in public space.
However, in the view of Nika, the Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language are, in her opinion, merely “the expansion of the limits for the Ukrainian language at the legislative level”.
In the past, Nice shared her experience in maintaining the Ukrainian language regime at a child camp in Karpatah, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with the Watsons bookstore network, one of which was connected to her in Russian.
When she didn't get her own way, Nick turned into a girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to reject Russian letters even in writing their names.
Recently, Nice stated that the name "Russia" was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer's anger was not able to escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: when she got there and heard the conversation with each other Russianly, she made a scandal and left, knocking on the door.

"You've missed a few fighters because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did he feel today?"
"If he's been 90 minutes, that means it's all right!
Actually, he felt good.
Maybe at the end of a bit of power, nothing happened.
And yes, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolievich Gashnev brought me to this game, for which they are so grateful!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after victory and recovery is easier, and the mood in the collective is good.
Now we had a white coat, even though it was black at first.
We need to continue in the same spirit and rejoice with the sick."
"Did he try to play when he didn't go out?"
"It's been a little awkward, because it's really an unpleasant situation.
But I'll do it again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors, which they put on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and encouraged the sick.
And the rest is secondary."

The head of the Board of the Federation of International Affairs Committee, Constantine Kosacev, considers the 73rd session of the UN Geneva Assembly to be successful for Russia and does not rule out that it will be able to return to the perception of the RF as an integral participant in addressing global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric we have been accustomed to in recent years to Russia has now been more inflamed," said the senator in an interview published in the Russian newspaper on Sunday.
He explained that in the past years, the RF was “described as one of the three major threats to humanity, along with the Ebola disease, together with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which was sufficiently unanimous in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, Kosacev stressed that “the topic of Russia was virtually absent in the negative key”.
"If I look carefully at the statement of the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the people were not exactly," said the politicians, noting that Russia "was not much a wall about which the punches are trained by a tennis ball."
The head of the Soufeda Profile Committee does not rule out that this is evidence of a trend that, in his view, “will be allocated to the current session [the UN Genoa Assembly], although this trend may be fully reflected in a year or two or three”.
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some sense be reversive," Kosacev said, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia's involvement in international affairs succeeds."
As an example, he led situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"So far, unfortunately, not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukraine crisis will also be excavated in time," the MP added.
This is related to the view that it appears that “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not simply an inalienable participant in addressing the global problems of modern times”.
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement will no longer be moving back, it'll be moving forward," he added.
Another "interested and important feeling" in this context, Kosacev called "a demand for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the Geneva Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, and I was delighted to see that if two or five years ago the Russian opinion, a Russian view of the world, which was largely uninterested, the situation was different," said the President of the Soufeda Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which is emerging from the West, has no answers to questions such as how to address the world’s problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in global space, how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration”.
"And here the demand for Russian vision is becoming more and more evident," Kosacev expressed confidence, stressing that he views the present session as a “good session for the work of a Russian delegation that is successful for Russia."

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idliba
Damascus hopes that there will be no military force in the Syrian province of Idlib, said the head of the media of the Syrian Arab Republic, Valid Muallem.
However, he said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had the opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the removal of the soldiers banned in Russia from the demilitarized zone of Idlib, reported "RA News".
The head of MIDI also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to military solutions to the problem of the territories east of Euphrates in the event of the desire for separatism of Kurds.
At the same time, in the opinion of Mullem, the talks with the Kurdish SDF were good until they were stopped because of the United States.
On 17 September Putin and President of Turkey, Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the lines of an armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.

Irina Geraštenko, the first speaker of the Supreme Council, apologized to the convicts in the RF for the "spianization" by Ukrainian journalist Roman Suštenko for not being able to release him from prison until now.
She said this in a video to a police lock-in, written before the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of the FSB.
She said that in those days under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, there was an action that was announced by the parties to a hunger protest demanding the release of Kremlin's subjects.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, there are people who know you well, hungry, supporting Oleg Sencov, other political prisoners, and of course, you.
There are no international meetings, no negotiations, no interviews, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us did not require pressure on the Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one requirement -- the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Krem," Heraštenko said.
She also expressed confidence that tests would be imposed on each Ukrainian by making us "seriouser in the protection of Ukraine's national interests, in the protection of each Ukrainian, in the understanding of what is good and what is evil".
The correspondent of Ukraine in France, Roman Suštenko, was detained by Russian forces on 30 September 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage at the Office of the Chief Research Office of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sustenko to 12 years in a strict regime, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized that the verdict was legal.
The Russian prisoners met the last request of Ukraine before it was phased into the colony.

"I couldn't even hold the bed"
Kikabidze’s Fighting Cancer
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, saves no one, but the stories of popular people on the victory over cancer, gives hope to many sick people.
A famous actor named Wachtang Kikabidze admitted that he lived only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"I'm like a hammer down my skull.
I fell.
He's lost his focus.
We're in the hospital.
He couldn't hold the bed there, he couldn't stand, he fell all the time.
The analysis started, it turns out, the artery doesn't miss blood.
They brought me to Moscow, where they said I had a big fucking bow in my head, and they had an emergency operation.
And during the operation of the whale doctors, they saw the swelling," said Kikabides in the "University" program.
The alarm has turned out to be a hoax.
At that time, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the chamber on the threshold of his house.
But the actress’s wife did not allow the living actor to be protected, she believed that she could cope with the illness and would not leave her beloved wife’s bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was around like a rock," admitted the actor.
The actor has managed to cope with the disease, and he now happily lives in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the hearing of his sickness, and the passing of time, which appear in the Network.
The founders of the Mirotretz website have introduced the "Cleanness" section of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Ceyarto.
The reason was “a temptation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of FDI, the neighbouring countries, highlighted “direct threats of invasion in Ukraine” and “support of separatist attitudes in Ukraine”, as well as the “organization of provocations aimed at the mass violation of Ukrainian citizens’ legislation”.
It should be noted that in front of Ceyarto, the deputy of Kiev-Pecher-Lavra Pavel and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) were approved by Onufrius.
As a result, they were opposed to the receiving of Thomas of Ukraine's local church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, the President of Ukraine, Petr Poroshenko, demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities called the sum of the golden parachutist's golden crown
At the same time, 23 salaries were paid to Deputy Governor of the Voronez Region by Jury Agibalov under the Regional Law on State Posts.
However, the actual amount of gold parachute released from office was several times less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations provided the press services of the regional Government.
Under the law, Agibalov's salary is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, it was stressed in the press service that the amount of one-off payment amounted to 223,892 rubles, rather than 1 million rubles written by the media.
The officer has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
Its public office is more than nine years old.
He was appointed to this pension and a one-time payment was made immediately after his resignation, explained to the agency “RIA Novosti” in the Government area.
However, the payment of Agibalov's pension was suspended when he was appointed to be a widower, and the amount of his salary was not altered compared to the previous period.
The winner of the governor ' s election, the governor of the region, Alexander Gussev, entered the post on 15 September.
Agibalov was released from office due to the expiration of the term of office of the head of the area.
Similarly, the credentials of other officials in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Telegram-Canal Nezigarh published documents indicating that Agibalov, who had resigned from the post of governor, had paid an exit allowance of 23 salaries, and two days later he had received a similar post without adding a “voio”.
A Member of the House called on school students to report on the damage of masturbation
He is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that adolescent masturbation is causing the harmful information they find on the Internet.
It is up to educational institutions and families to fight this, and the deputy added.
Gennady Oneštenko, MP of the FF (in the interview of the Moscow-speaking radio station):
As part of the overall sexual education of children, this must be done by reason of the loss, because there is a risk of sexual health of the child, both male and female.
The problem is objective, it is that child rearing takes place early enough, and there are also large knives between their sexual rearing and the possibility of formal inter-sex contacts.
According to Oneštenko, the problem is preventing “handling”, “the problem of sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate education for children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are exposed to it.
The honourable Member believes that the lessons to be learned about the harm of anonymism are primarily in the schools of the “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we just won't get along with you, easy to talk," said Professor.
Gennadius Onešchenko is a current academic of RAMN, a member of the Bureau of RAMN, a doctor of medical sciences, professor.

Agg became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" is a regular record of popularity, and the ratings of Angel Merkel fall.
According to all, the people of Germany began to take a serious stand against the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which led to the country's leading target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most importantly, the most recent issues are that the anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" party is becoming more and more popular and the positions of Merkel and Zeehofer ruling party are weakening.
This week, AdG hit a regular record, rising to the second line in the rating of people's sympathy.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 per cent of the population were able to move around social democrats, with about 16 per cent.
The gap in one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but it cannot be noted that the fact that Agg from a small group of Eurosceptics economists established in 2013 has been able to become a serious political force.
Leadership in general has so far continued to hold the HCS/HDS ruling block, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards the loss of points - still in April the support of Angela Merkel's block was four percentage points above.
The German chancellor's personal rating, which is headed by the German Government for the fourth consecutive period, is also declining.
In support of Angela Merkel today, 48 per cent of the Germans, 7 per cent below last year.
In addition, the social democrats followed by greens (15 per cent), left ones (11%) and liberals (10 per cent).
Evolution of Alternatives
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, in which members of the Christian Democratic Union joined.
The Group initially opposed the government course, but only economic issues, including the problems of the euro and EU interaction, were dealt with at first.
While the group opposed the "sponsoring" of Germany's weak EU economies, it did not rule out the possibility of return to the German brand and the full withdrawal of the country from the Euro Union.
In the light of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a fully-fledged party that took up the Eurosceptics network and began to criticise the Government for the failure of immigration policies.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AdG was the first to go to Bundestag, with 94 MP chairs (from 709).
Two alternate representatives for Germany were given seats in the European Parliament.
Published video by a journalist named Ukrainian citizen "Bulvan Nation"
The leading political show on Ukrainian TV, the author of the two books of Ostap Drozdov in direct air acknowledged that he considered his fellow citizens as "a Bolvan nation".
They believe in television and they don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, living and working in such a country is difficult.
"We don't have a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood," said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on TV and Radio Independent began to fight against literature containing minor objections to the criticism of the Kyiv authorities by banning imports of up to 201 publications.

Named after the death of the Universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world observed, about 13.8 billion years old.
An international study of the scientific community is published in the library of e-prints arXiv.org and published in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings were made by the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope of Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
As a result of the distribution of dark matter and dark energy of more than 95 per cent of the world's energy mass observed, scientists have assessed the expansion of the universe, which was somewhat slower than was previously considered.
The press release of the Subaru observatory noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the European Space Telescope Planck's data provided details of the limitations imposed on LCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new evidence to the effect that the world under review would cease to exist after 22 billion years as a result of the Great Depression.
A regular attempt to unite pension referencing initiators failed
The possibility of finding a people ' s opinion on pension reform is delayed for an indefinite period.
In Moscow, a referendum on the increase in pension age was held on Saturday by the General Federal Initiative Group.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered various language issues (the entire Central Committee has registered five languages).
They decided to apply to the CIC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: “Are you in a position to ensure that, as of 1 July 2018, the age at which the citizens of Russia are entitled to an old-age pension is not increased?”
This was registered by the Flemish sub-group, whose representatives did not participate in the assembly, but considered it to be the simplest and most legal tool.
Most of the participants in the meeting were members of the Fair Russia, Eli Sviridova (six sub-groups) and CRC (four sub-groups).
Three independent sub-groups from the Netherlands, Virginia and Orenburg joined them.
Sviridov had previously told the authorities that the invitations were sent to all the initiators and that there were about 40 sub-groups in agreement.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, the leader of the Voluntary Subgroup (it was supported by another 15 subgroups), said to the "Administrators", that the invitations were not received and were not planned to come: "We did not understand who was the other and who was the enemy."
Death of the blue singer Otis Rash
At 84 years of age, a famous Chicago blue guitarist and singer Otis Rash died, reports AP with reference to his manager Rick Beats.
He died as a result of difficulties following the stroke in 2003.

He was very familiar with the "I Can't Quit You Baby" in 1956, which took on the sixth Billboard R&B rating.
"Admiral" has created great problems for us.
"Admiral" has created great problems for us.
Master Coach Ak Barrs Zinetula Billetdinov led the match of regular champion KCl against Admiral (4:2).
"The simple game was complicated.
The opponent was a worthy warrior, causing us great trouble.
It's a pleasure that we've played a good game today in the majority.
I've already said that some naked people will come, mainly to work on it.
And what we have won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripo's advance in this series?"
"We have our program on which he works.
That's why it was such a decision," says Billettin's Press Service Club.
Ilon Mask will be the head of the board of directors of Tesla
According to the agreement, Mr. Moscow would have to resign from office as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
While the businessman will retain the position of the company's chief executive director, the AFP reports with reference to the controller's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Earlier, the regulator filed a claim against Ilon Maska - officials considered that he had misled Tesla investors, since the businessman had allowed the purchase of all shares of the company at a high price - $420 per paper.
In Loko's match, Ahmat, Turbin's mistakes fell off the edge of an abundance.
Former world judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of Evgenian Turbin in the 9th Tour of Russia's Locomotiv Championship, Ahmat, and picked up the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate Evgenia Turbina in the Locomotiv match, Ahmat?
- I believe that the referee confirmed his inappropriateness to the Russian Prime Minister's court.
I am surprised that the efforts made to meet the fifth Spartacus Tour - Dinamo, not Turbin himself, nor the DSI leaders have made serious conclusions about its low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private failures of rough receptions fell as a corner of abundance.
For example, for the 50th minute, Eder's railer is hit by hand in his criminal area, Ahmata Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put the pens.
- How do you rate the episode with Idou, who was at 82 minutes when it turned out that the ball had fallen into his hand?
- I think there was an intentional play by the defense officer in his criminal court.
Turbin was close to the moment, and this episode and his first assistant on the right were very good.
That moment was to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three were asleep, and no warrants were assigned.
Thus, the score in the match has been distorted, and sports justice has been extinguished.
It was the same case when a court of opinion had drawn up and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- At 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove the defender of the guests of Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules against Krychovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he protested.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second "sweetie"?
- Turbin and the first yellow card didn't show up at all.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of justice that some teams are being put in jail for violations like in the episode with Ido, and there is no one.
What do you appreciate the words of the football player?
- See what you can understand under double standards.
They were pens.
They didn't give it to him.
So, the referee doesn't give the second penance in the opposite gate.
This is the principle used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge sees who's playing.
He played Locomotiv on Saturday and Ahmata had serious claims to the work of Turbin because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the defendant in rape by Judge Cavano at the SNL.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, who was accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of a new Saturday Night Live broadcast season on the NBC television channel.
During a little sketch, the actor played Cavano at the hearings in the rape panel.
The candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed stories during his interview with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Yes, Kawano repeatedly admitted in his love for beer, but he said he had never drunk before.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Cavano stated that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments were also played by Damon.
I was just doing a lot of drinking and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the most proud, drunk virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone knows that," the judge said in execution of Matt Damon.
Previously, Kawano was elected U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbra Strezand found in her cloned dogs a strange behavior.
American singer Barbra Strezand said that the clones of her dead dog were different from the original pituitary.
"They don't look like it.
In fact, [the clones] look like she, but it's impossible to clone the soul," stressed 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Strezand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog, a cotton-de-teller named Samantha, who had to stop because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that Chihuahua’s dog called the Cudo-Milly (Miracle Milly), the youngest dog in the world, was cloned on the 49th time.
Specialists are trying to clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States of America has been considering Russia's maritime blockade due to oil and gas supply
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade can begin to gain advantages in the world energy market.
The US authorities have been so busy fighting for the success of the world's carbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia's maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's leading energy suppliers.
The U.S. head of the media recently told Ryan Zinke about the possibility of a maritime blockade.
In contrast to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior is not a police officer, but a civil servant, including a natural resource policy.
Zinka's statement was therefore fully within the competence of the authority in charge of him, although no political decoration had been lacking.
Addressing industrial events in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that US military and maritime forces controlled sea routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
Zinka said that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world's energy market.
Zincke recalled that Russia still receives a lion ' s share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe has been the main motivation for the activation of Moscow in this region, as Zinka is certain.
The Minister pointed out that the United States was still looking to provide leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To this end, Washington will have to force Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes, which is an acceptable measure, is considered by Zincka.
The Colombian director received good feedback from the festival
Our landman, the actor Eugenias Sangadjiev, and his movie Harmony ("Harmonia") were blessed with a special mention of the members of the jury of the Sixth Debate Festival "The Movement", which took place in Mr. Omske.
The festival's festival said that "this is a signal for the immediate response of major industrial film players."
As you know, a picture of the young Calmetic director was presented in the short film "The Movement. Home", where eight filmmakers participated.
The main prize in this competition program was the painting "Jana is Ana on the contrary" - director's debut by Jana Gladki's actresses.
The focus of the National Film Festival of Debate Movement was on a young film, but not on the age of the decision-makers, but on their spirit, desire and ability to risk.
The Elystin School of Arts, named P. Chunkushov and RATI-GITIS Evgenien Sangajiev, meets all of these requirements.
He is young, talented, creative and in his creations striving for new non-standard forms of self-expression.

There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Ex-Captain Chelsea and English constable John Terry, about why he went to the 9th Tour of Russia's Spartacus champion, "Rostov" (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I'm following.
I've been following him recently, and I've been interested in looking at him from the side.
I can't say that I'm a patient, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have a sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision made," says Terry's patient website Chelsea.
Remember, Rostov with 18 points was raised to the third place in the tournament table, and Spartak was on the fifth line with 15 points active.
On the next tour, on 7 October, the Red and White play with Enise, and the Valerie Carpina will receive Orenburg the day before.
The road script was put in a lombardo for no price
When a man in the city of Somerville (Massachutes) brought a script to the LBC Boutique and Loan lambbard, he offered only 50 dollars for an old and unrepresentable tool.
But the experienced store manager Dylan Mcdermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive tool and sought advice from the expert.
The script was found to have been produced in 1759 by famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galiano and is estimated to be $250,000.
Only one screws are valued at $16,000 to $18,000.
The investigation found that the script had not been stolen from one of the city’s inhabitants for so long, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
Until we know how the violin came to the man who put it in the lobby, but there are no past clashes with the law.
The manager said that now all those who brought the script into the lobby would be asked to play on it to make sure that it really belonged to the client.
In the ninth round, the RPL is waiting for us to face a captivating challenge: Spartacus will take to his "Rostov" stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valeria Carpina, a man who is known not to be a "national team".
The speciality of this meeting adds that the clubs now have the same number of points - by 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, leaving the far-off "Zenaita" and in one point from "Craznodar", which tomorrow is playing with "Dinama".
In the red-and-white field now uneasy: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, the Masimo Carrera team suddenly flew into Rapido, and recently moved into the home of Ahmatu.
After a fight with the CSCA, which ended with a fair nobody, Spartacus played with a minimum account and not without work in Cuba, Black Sea, and as soon as he spoke about whether Russia's most popular club had approached the end of the crisis.
The "Rosts" three matches in a row couldn't win, because the hits don't even know five.
Let's see if Karpina can extend a harmless series of such principles to himself as a winner.
The previous meeting of the Carpino Rostov with Spartacus ended in favour of the chair team.
Start at 7:00.

London is indicted in Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the cold war, said British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson.
However, England will protect its values, he stressed during the meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
More and more, Iran and North Korea are becoming more and more dangerous, the enemies are operating in severe zones with the help of cyberattacks and false news, the minister added.

Translator compared the mentality of Russian and German
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples varies, but few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding.
On 30 September, the translator told the professional synchronist, Berbel Saxe.
It has been in Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan things calmly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "are long enough to go fast."
But it seems to me that for understanding between peoples and for the work of the translator, it does not play a major role," said a specialist in the comment "RIA News".
According to the translator, to understand that two countries don't get together without each other, "enough to know the story."
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are a lot of things that determine our overall destiny," she said.
The day before, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany stated that the country was trying to "link" relations with Russia and support them.
According to her, Berlin Mania is particularly important for the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is built from the coast of Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

Tonight's School Comedy led the American Box Office
The evening school comedy, which debuted in American theaters last Friday, earned $28 million for its first weekend in the screenplay.
This led to the unintended picture of Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in the main role of the United States Boxing Office in 28-30 September.
In the international market, films have collected $5.5 million, including 2 million of British audiences, while only 20 countries have gone to the international market.
In the struggle for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Li, which is remarkable enough to overcome another new Western prosthetic multitial "Smolfoot", the curious story of the knowledge of the enigmatic life with a human race representative, whose main hero never believed in it.
The project of directors Carrie Kirkpatrick and Jason Reig for its initial outputs collected $23 million, generally justified the expectations of experts who predicted 20-25 million a week.
With regard to the Summaries of Smolfoot, they currently account for $38.6 million (but it has already been debuted in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active here, with a film sentence of 3.6 million.
The three most powerful of them this time closed the story "Tyna home with hours" from the horror master Ela Rot, finally proving that the director is capable of making a quality film and for the 12+ audience.
In his second week, John Bellers' screenplay with charming Jack Blake and Kate Blancett earned $12.5 million, bringing total world taxes to $53.8 million.
Despite the trip from top-3, he continues to be amazed by the sign of the "+" trailer with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick: 17 days in the United States picture of Paul Fig, from which some unrealistic financial performances were not originally expected of the word "total", collected $43 million (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has up to 62.9 million total expenses.
The last representative of the first Friday this week was the horror of the Monaghan Curse, which amounted to $5.4 million in the reporting period.
Spin-off "Zaklati" after 24 days in the United States (and not only, of course) cinema has a $330 million total salary on its account and has been proud of the most successful French film, which also includes two parts of "Zaklati" and two strips of Annabel's yellow doll.

In his first child, a well-known installer (and from recent directors) Gregory Plattkin, who had previously worked in a number of major horror projects, including "Happy Day of Death", where "Hallfest" places looked very similar, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Taking into account the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh became "Unreasonably Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems not to be coming out of the top-10 U.S. Box Office: a romantic comedy already living on screen for the seventh week, was the sixth in September in the most frequent genre tape rating for the entire history of 165.7 million.
That is what the picture has been working on the internal market for the time being, and the total size of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three luckys who fell into a dozen collections in the United States in 28-30 September, they became the Hishnik, the White Boy Rick, and... the Badger's goal, who earned $3.7 million, 2.38 million and 1.1 million last weekend respectively.
Let us add that, in the next coming out of the United States, we will collect the debt-deserved "Ven" with Tom Hardy, who, without any doubt, will have leadership in the U.S. Box office as a result of the first exits in October.
From the other premier of the next week, it's worth distributing the "Star Born" music album, the Venice Film Festival Laureate of Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hat".

Valerie Belov: God helped Siberia today.
Main coach "Vitanzas" Valeries Belov - about the defeat of "Sibiri" (3:4) in the match of regular champion KHL.
"The College spoke of Siberian patients, and I want to mention our patients," says the White official website "Vitanzas".
"I hope they will do the same because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
By the game, it's probably that the Lord helped Siberia today, because it's already been very rough, especially our leaders.
We've lost our leading leaders, so we've had a hard time getting this match out, even though there's been moments.
But anyway, I'll take the blame.
Because I think we've missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was the second team."
"It's an inconvenient cove."
The audience is upset by Agutin's choice of voice show.
The viewers of the "Golos 60+" show accused Leonid Agutin's teacher of "unsightly coves and naked bunnies."
When in the blind hearings he first heard his father's voice, Nikola Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the executioner.
But the son’s feelings were taken up, and he chose a relative in his team.
At that time, many felt that it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher for not objectivity at the first stage.
But the joke was delayed, and the star's father was absolutely unfairly taken over by more worthy performers.
And now the audience is no longer ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the show’s spectators, were upset by the camouflage of their close relatives on the final ladder.
I had even doubted that Agutina would have enough power and conscience to stop her dad from going to the top," Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin said in the TV program.
In the meantime, for his father Leonid Agutin "silly" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovic sang a touching song about his mother, explaining this to the audience that they still want to see his father's show.
But, as it turns out, the viewers want an objective assessment and see the finals of really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I can feel the Voice from the Agutin team, they're doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed him how he loved the pope, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave the project to their father, who is not a poet, but a whisper, how can you then be called a teacher?"
"He likes the Pope's poet, organizes a concert in Kremlin for his money and sees how many people will come to this concert."
It's a voice show, not a cruel family show.
"On the side of Agutina it was unprofessional."
"Then it's time to invite the Pope to do his own show, not the show that's done for the money of the 1 Channel."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took some place.
And I don't understand why the silent dad should make me understand more than anyone else with real environmental data.
Why did the worker from Surgut come with a magnificent voice and a temple, and the pope of Agutina was brought to the finish?
And then we all complain about the same faces on the stage and on the screens for decades!
'Cause I'm not going to go through the kitchen.'
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's a circle of mud and camouflage.
And the family budget will not be left!
The play of absurdity continues!"
The users also recalled that the son of the city came to the blind during one of the traditional "Gols" seasons.
Then the meter and the head didn't have to take the son on his own.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all right."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called "a tooth" for the 7-Eleven network store manager: in May, he was released from the store for an unpleasant behaviour.
And he decided to avenge his enemy in an original way.

He was put in prison and released to the court on bail at $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of other property and criminal offences, as well as with the prohibition to enter the store and approach the manager.

Russian pilot Williams Sergey Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the Grand Pri Russian race.
"I'm telling you, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I was between the two cars that I was sorry for right away.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, right now.
It turned out to be a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
They were hoping that after the rest of us get on foot, we're going to fall into clean air, and we're going to get back to speed, but there's no more reindeer.
Plus, he fought with a partner, and he was in touch with him.
I understand he's a little mistaken.
We've been in this situation on the busiest track of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful if it was true.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin's RIA News.

Tarpiv called the absurd removal of Glushakov and Eštenko from the base of Spartacus.
The president of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpischev commented on the removal of Moscow's Spartacus footballers Denis Glushakov and Andrey Ešenko from training with the main composition after the joke of the lead coach of the Massimo Carrera team, reports "Sport Weekend".
The actions of Carrera were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is insanity.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It just deepens the disorder in the team.
First of all, these are texts, read and understand them as they please.
I wouldn't have responded to this at Carrera's.
Each one has his own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to bury.
If Glushakov and Eštenko are making jokes, that doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I don't think the Italian has enough flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate of the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so this situation didn't have to be broken up at all.
Maybe it was the same time it was worth laughing at.
Spartacus has a lot of misconception in different lines, there is a lack of play after the youth is introduced.
The internal relations of the teams, according to all, do not add optimism to this match," is sure Tarpištev.
The game of two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 19.00 a.m. in Moscow.
Previously rejected by Spartacus John Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
Sirius students discussed environmental technologies with scientists
The students of the Syrian Education Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended the lecture of the National Research Centre "Kurchatovsky Institute".
The presentation of the researchers was made under the Global International Forum for Convergence and Environmental Technologies, organized in Soci by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film entitled "Kodia Kurcchavov", during which the President of the Kurcchav Institute, co-rapporteur RAN Mikhail Kowalchuk, described global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
A lecture by a scientist published on the Syrian website.
The school learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet available.
To address this problem, according to forum organizers, will help the environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the topic of environmental technology development, as well as related risks that inevitably arise in the development of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a huge asset.
This is an explosive growth in medical technology, an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
In fact, the development of environmental technologies is a technological reproduction of living natural systems.
There is a turning point - targeted intervention in human activity.
There's always a risk.
There was a car, people were going to die under wheels.
But cars still use them.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I'm creating a new medical technology, but I can create weapons of mass destruction," quoted REN TV as saying.
After reviewing the film and discussing the current scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the meeting.
The role of speakers was the candidate for physical and mathematical sciences, the Head of the NBICS Kurchav complex, the NBIC-natural technologies NIC "Kurchavsky Institute" Julia Djakova and the Head of the NBIC-Technologies Network, Vyacheslav Demin.

Macedonia: the referendum did not take place due to the low appearance
The referendum was called for the approval of the agreement by the authorities in Athens and Skopje on the renaming of the Balkan country into northern Macedonia.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The new name has forced the former Yugoslav Republic to open its way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34 per cent of the cases in the resurrected plebiscites “did not touch” to the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to refuse to rename.
Speaking soon after the elections were closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, the proponent of the change in the name of the Republic, said that if more "yes" appeared among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name, regardless of the quorum.

On 30 September, a report appeared on a well-known website in the social network, from an observer, that the rudder animals were freely drifting through one of the local storage sites.
The small herd of animals passed between the fence and the grass.
Comments expressed different opinions: Some locals said that there was no harm in the presence of small horned cattle, and their appetite could even help to clear the territory of the sour and grasses, but some of the city's inhabitants did not suffer from animal behavior:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's something for the barons to do.
You can't say that they're expensive, but it's not like that." (Laughter)
Either way, one of the eyewitnesses pointed out that the animal problem in the middle of the tomb was already known and that the necessary measures would soon be taken.
To give and to give up - how right?
A word of pressure does not exist.
That's right.
The word "breathing" means "to pull, influence, influence" is only phonetic, because we hear the sound [a] instead of the word "suffer."
We use that word, thinking it's a "pression."
But "pressurization" and "exposure" are not only psychologically close, but even in some sense the opposite.
Be sure of that yourself.
To be brought up (in books, old ones) means "suffering enough, full enough, enough to be enough for anyone or anything to satisfy."
Satisfying, pleasure is family words.
Previously, it was still important "not to depend on anything, to be self-sufficient" - "to be self-sufficient."
The old Slavic "dwell" by the family word "revelation" and "will".
To push, to push, to push.
In these words, the truly frightening "family": daos - "wolves" (sheep), dieja - "dead" and dust - "treasure".
A similar phonetic form of the words "press" and "stop", as well as the inevitable ageing of the latter, have led them into contamination.
So we found it the very "d" to go in," which is also used in writing through "a", which is, in the best case, incorrect and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
Well, that's right.
But that word is outdated, in its true meaning it is no longer in use.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative influence on you above, use the word "smooth".
You can also use the construction "show pressure", but remember that it's an office.

Our machine is very slower than Mercedes.
The Ferrari pilot Kimi Reekkonen is about the qualifications of Gran-pri Russia, which led him to take fourth place.
"Who, did you have a chance to fight for the pool today?
How good was the car?"
"It looks like Mercedes was much faster today," says Rickkonen F1News.Ru.
But the behavior of our car has been better since the beginning of the weekend."
"As a result of the qualification, you did not fall into the speed of Sebastian Fettel, but the delay was still noticeable.
What's the reason?"
"My attempt was not bad, but then there was one of the Mercedes pushers.
He was ready to try and could have missed me, but I guess I've lost it for a while.
However, this has hardly had a major impact on the outcome."
"In Sochi it's very difficult to fight, the start of the race will be a key point?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how it works.
It's not going to be easy in any case, because our car notices a slower Mercedes machine.

One of them was told in Twitter by German journalist Kristi Ditz.
She wrote on her side that her four-year-old son had parked his escape (baby bike without pedals) around the same front column.

"Unfortunately, they don't draw the same attention as the naked ones."
"This is the peace we need!"
The readers asked the journalist if she could find out who was the author of the idea.
For this man was, in all likelihood, somewhere around; he watched as the baby was parked, and that's what happened to him.
The flower really deserves a place in Formula-1.
Russian rider Mikhail Alešin - on the return of co-occupier Daniel Quetta to Formula 1 as the Toro Rosso pilot.
I think it's just remarkable news: Formula 1 will show up another Russian pilot, and it will be Dana.
I think he really deserves this place, and he hasn't said everything in Formula 1.
Yes, often not everything was as it should be, and I think he hasn't even realized a part of his capacity yet.
It will be interesting to watch his speeches in the future year," says Alešina SMP Racing.

With the assistance of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, 85 thousand of them destroyed the FF Air Force.

Thus, Bondarev noted that in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism on the far-reaching side, otherwise this evil would “be inclined towards us”.

Mitropolit Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC with fascist actions
The head of the Synod Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Ilarion, compared the appointment of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church of Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists against the Jews.
"It is equally true that in the Fascist Germany, Jews would have a yellow ostracic star, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose this bill had been created," said the Russian-24 telephony micropolite (interfax quote).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was in a state of urgency.
This is how Kiev hopes to gain full control of the UPC and “put it out of the law”, the minister believes.
"This is the Ukrainian Church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are the patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier, it was known that the High Council members were working on the implementation of Bills No.4128 (on the change in the membership of religious communities), No.4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (on the change in the name of religious organizations).

Vice-Chairman of Pochaevska Lavra called for the protection of Orthodox and Ukrainian shrines

At different times, our ancestors and relatives in the faith and spirit of Christians had to confess their faith and protect their holiness.
In view of the situation and the information we have and the threats to the trial that is being spread, it is clear that we will have to experience something," the Mitrpolite said.
He asked for the support of a prayerful, moral one.
Also, the Deputy Laver stressed that "your physical presence will probably be needed."
The priest said, "Lenin's grandsons are in danger of sedition, so let us protect our sacredness."
The fate of the Pochaev Lavra, the Orthodox Ukraine and the world sanctuary, must be prepared to protect it, is said to be addressed.
Mitropolitan called for no mention of those who led the believers astray.
UPC has canonical status as defined by Thomas of 29 October 1990 by Mother Church.
And now someone wants to put in place a new-style patriarch and another Catholic pope of the Roman Warfare.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we're happy with the status that our church has," said the deputy of the Laver.
He recalled that since October 1990, UPC has been able to be independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
How else do we need Thomas?" - noted the Mittropolit Pochaevsky Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask if there are any other confessions of Thomas, are they independent of the Vatican?
And the believers were of some measure cut off, and determined what kind of temple they were going in.
However, someone wants to reoccupy the enmity and strife.
Some may envy that the dome is shining on the temples that they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
The starting lava is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Laver is located at the top of Pochaevsky Mountain, 70 km from Ternopol.
The first historical information about it is about the beginning of the 13th century.

Against the conservative opposition and the President of the country of George Ivanov.

But that decision will have negative consequences.
I'll lose sovereignty first.
There are obviously countries that do not wish Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."

The country was at a loss.
The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only the Balkans but Europe as a whole."
