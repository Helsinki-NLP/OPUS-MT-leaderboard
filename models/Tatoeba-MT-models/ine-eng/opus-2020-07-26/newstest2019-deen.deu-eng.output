"Schöne Münchnerin" 2018!
In the afternoon a surprise awaits our candidates: they will not fight the romantic Candlelight shooting before MY SOLARIS alone, but on the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flowers, cocktails, seduce - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchenin" candidates deliver at the shooting with people photographer Tuan and resist wind, rain and rain like a real profession.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB Chief Grindel doesn't see the basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently does not see any basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"That's a question of course that depends on getting into conversation once, that you also talk to him about why he obviously felt it as much as it was in his status," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasemährer" of the "Image-Zeitung.
Despite the month-long debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been glad if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I've also come to a certain point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
In July, the 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team and also justified that he had not defended his grindel against racist enemies during the WM.
The DFB-Chief reiterated his criticism at Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and Team Manager Oliver Beerhoff.
He doesn't want to build any pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if "you leave a team or a club change, you talk about it with his coach and I find it a shame that this conversation hasn't stopped so far."
Linz: Garden huts burned in Schrebergartensidelung
At 14:13 p.m., the firefight Linz was alarmed to a fire in the fire department.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schreberg species settlement, there was a delay in danger.
The firefight broke out and found the cabin in full-fledged.
The roof had to be removed practically to the full and fire shields had to be removed to the required extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had lit an battery to charge at noon.
That could be the fire thing.
In any case, the charger was located according to firearms in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be ascertained - as is the case with the fire.
However, it should be significant, for the owner had many collector pieces in his garden cottage.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open street
What has Lindsay Lohan only driven to this extremely remarkable action?
She apparently wanted to enter a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fullly Loaded") himself streamed live as she apparently wanted to enter a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial average of the stream.
Here you can see "Happy kiss" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family who want to have her as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees right in front of the actress, Lohan persecutes the parents and their children.
She sees the adult child trafficking.
For all of this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the manifestly angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an earring.
Under the tears, the actress then admires how shocked she is - and she keeps the waves.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently quite unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the Asteroids
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is designed to get so close to the Asteroid Ryugu that it can zoom material from its surface and bring it to the ground.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: The number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths were reported.
The number of victims could continue to rise.
The rescue teams have not yet been driven into the devastated and cut off areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk returns to Tesla Supervisory Council
At first it was a tweet.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk took care of the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. stock exchange supervision accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and music must be paid, and the chief of Tesla withdraws from the Board of Supervisors, but the chairman of the board may remain.
Party day of British Conservatives
Watch sharp - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham will be the stage of a power struggle.
The party is about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference of Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit Hardliners is overestimated at the front of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Reference for a new name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting over these name-debts for years.
Now they've united themselves.
The state of Macedonia is going to be called northern Macedonia in the future, and on this Sunday the population is voting - is it good?
Protests in Brazil against lawmakers Bolsonaro.
"El Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood was split in the country.
Thousands went to several cities on the road to protest against the law-makers, Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brasiliens" is an anti-system candidate and is thus in front of the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: Dieselgate processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Taskforce still exists," said Development Manager Peter Mertens to the automotive week.
The arrested and approved Audi-Chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all motor/power combinations were expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we have achieved an important goal in the development of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was established in September 2015 following the discovery of the Diesel Canal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder has made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
The VW Supervisory Board had a decision on the future of Stadler on Friday and wanted to discuss further on this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities shall forward to the head of the audit to allow the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values, after the gas dealers have been notified.
In doing so, he knew of the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
The company is currently headed by the sales board Bram Schot as the Head of the Board of Directors.
Due to the conversion to the new gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production accidents in Audi, said the shot of the "heilbroner voice".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 that are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment is difficult," he said.
Shot puts on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi-Electro car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm is to be held in the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite his criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil affair in the coming year, wants to re-apply to the office as DFB President.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, he found it "remarkable" if, after the award for the football-EM 2024, he didn't have a chance to work on the future project.
Grindel has been a member of the Association Manager since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was a member of the Sommermarchen affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first complete three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the DFB-Bundesday on 27 September 2019.
The future EM leader Philipp Lahm is to work with the DFB Bureau, according to Grindel.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he was also in the Bureau with advice and then of course warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB leader.
As a consequence of the business about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed the wish that in the future a national player should become DFB's integration ambassadors without migration background.
Currently, this office of the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person with no migration background clearly influences society and football and says that "the subject is important, we need to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Correct weight loss with semi-cluster
I've been owning a new toy for four weeks.
A weight that not only measures my weight, but also the part of the body fat.
Musculoskeletal and bone mass can also be shown.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the harvest.
He doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle.
Baseball League: Clear performances for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin is launched with a clear victory in the new season of the basketball league.

The new gamemaker Will Cummings surprised the old burgers with 25 numerators.
The Braunsweger, with NBA star Dennis Schröder since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1-run of the basketball quickly made sure for clear conditions.
Opens his mosaic in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at his three-day state visit.
Criticism in Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to issue supporters of the Golden Movement living in Germany and to take a stand against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow the PKK or Gulen movement sympathisers to shield our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the inner city of Cologne was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were involved - among them are sharp shields.
The Islam League Ditib is critical because it is considered to be an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": music against poverty: stars, drills and seconds
Artists such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have spent more time in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York Central Park.
"Entacts you wherever you can, wherever you can only," Mendes said at the festival on the night of the Sunday before about 600.0 spectators.
Thanks for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Players such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations showed themselves at the stage in the multi-hour show.
Meanwhile, however, there was a second of horror when many spectators kept the sound of an overwhelming metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
In a short time panic broke out, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people out of the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert there was as free each year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
On the other hand, for the numerous musicians and actors, there was the audience of Jubilee and Applaus - drums for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He and his democratic colleague Chris Coons spoke on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke on behalf of the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, and this led many women to the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which it rejects.
Flake requested an FBI investigation of the drafts after he had faced two women who, according to their own data, had experienced sexual abuses on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You also like to come up with me at any time," Flake now told the audience at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's draft
Governor Steffen Seibert defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had passed a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first series.
The T-shirt, if it wasn't the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
By the actions of the journalist, there was a strong unrest, which was not acceptable.
That's why he's got people to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Office.
This is entirely independent of whether it is a legitimate matter or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are subjected to alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Guilder movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the damaged Putsch trial on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe before the Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirgast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of.
They came free and could return to Germany, but in Turkey there are still processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and good-looking he usually knows his fans: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for moisturizing talks on the theme of Hamburg's harbour button "shellfishposts".
Moderator Ina Müller attacks with her guests on some beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks to unlock the mood and tongue.
Not few promises are also drunk for the mandatory singing facilities.
Another consequence of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Blessed Day".
The Munich got the trip in the high north but not good at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely scratched, the eyes just two small pieces.
The bed-selfie shows a completely exposed Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
Towards his fans he posted some - perhaps not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: DO NOT go to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which ina smears about half three, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans just posted a few tips to fight the riots.
They are made of instant broaches, fish brooches or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves over the view of the normally attractive kinostar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night so far, it is not known.
Since she has moderated the TV play on the theme since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more challenging...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and intolerance
The entrance to the 36 km long railway road in the Red Käpchen country in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and wash.
Recipes against the gruesome vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly available.
Scherben, cigarettes, garbage and unrat, demolished mills and now demolished signposts - this has been the way since long the entrance with a seat group to the bike road on the Haaße-Hügel in Treysa.
For the preview object Railway road in the Redkäpchen country a more than imaginable view.
The topic is occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, as well as by others for a long time, according to the City of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Radiation Council.
There's no solution.
The proposals range from the removal of the seat group to the regular discharge of the waste containers and the cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the last would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced to the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive bikers and residents - the seating group is at the weekend regular meeting point to celebrate.
It is not only often loud, in the battles it is also destroyed: cracks from the ground, demolished mussels, painted paintings, exposed furniture.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more frequently, told ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are just the verbal drops on the hot rock.
They are angry that the rust place on the bike in Treysa meeting point is for storage.
"The focus is clearly on the Haaße-Hügel along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also taking care of the new railway station in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be very expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance at the hill: "Maybe it makes the threshold significantly higher to join the community.
However, this would require a police check to be carried out in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants to develop the Haaße hill.
He had to be more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle so far could be very satisfactory.
The tourist market is still fully accessible.
Our bike route is very high compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger site, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascherøder Straße in Treysa.
There's no trimmings on the Haaße hill.
In the case of regular traffic, it may happen that bicycle drivers have to wait in the middle of the road between road traffic flows on the side," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but perhaps for older ones and especially for children.
Music-Contest in Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and intertwined.
"D to play a song for Hiltrup" is the call of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Music".
A contest "with eyebrows in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family meeting with coffee and cakes from the honorary officials of the cultural railway station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachtener in Hiltrup, nine of the "helpup star colours", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, a ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland and finally Rick Weßling and the Swarkies.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't experienced that in other parts of the city.
Where did the texts come from?
At the places, the Hiltruper Lake and the Markettallee found particular mention.
Rolf Ihmig shorted the Allie in his striking song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural railway station was also honored.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short conversions with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their creation.
This is how one learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
To report to the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he was currently in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Frank said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the helptrupper gastronomy.
However, for the favorites of the jury there was something special - so that others could hear their songs too.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Shemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who especially impressed Frank with his musicality, and the "Lumerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators at guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like everyone else, the children went to the finale again - and even cried without electronic support "very good", as Frank said.
Leading the jury was the originality of the aspects, the reference to helprup, the availability of the melody and the recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economics Association, as well as Jan Kaven, president of the district offensive.
The district offensive had caused the event to come to life because of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players are two teams facing each other.
For each side, there is a visual display, containing four cards with keywords that can only be deduced when inserted - the old trick with the red foil.
Thus, it is ensured that the opposite side can also read from memory.
Then on the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Würfel.
"Fest."
These are the terms that are always used to encrypt it.
Because the terms are not to be discussed here, but codes.
By contrast, one player per team is the cipher.
He gets a code card that might be "3.4.2.".
They are to be consulted in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should, in this order and in this example, describe the terms "Wood", "Fest" and "Window" - and so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team is not possible; for this wins the party if he manages to knock the code twice.
So, the key player notes and reads aloud: "Put out" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to the party; here, of course, would be as much possible as "Party" and "Prag" because he has attended the school and knows the window noise there.
So it goes round for rounds, team for team.
Although you do not know the terms on the other side, it can be better combined with any indication the cipher gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too reversed should be the replacements, otherwise making it unnecessary for his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic of "decrypto" is the rule.
The partners must probably study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has just released will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as decisive as predecessors and genre primes "codenames", which also push a subject of agents to play less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And who is just about advice and not about points of victory, it can easily find a version for two.
Kullbach: Man shows police Hitler groß and harasss guests in the button
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulbach at night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
He first showed the Hitler Great in the Upper City a passing police force, and later he also fell into a button when he harassed other guests in the Upper City.
After he had failed to comply with clearly alcoholicizing the place indicated by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulbach in the prison cell.
In a more neutral state, he must also be held accountable in criminal terms for the use of constitutional signs.
Works Pressig was home to the school block
The railway operation in Pressig was the turning disc in Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers were chewing on buffers, you heard it all in the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It didn't set anyone up.
The brakes were still there, and the wagons were smashing.
It was just a clear railway.
Statements that are meaningful for thinkers' home pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Stilerampen mountain range to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters has its point of descent in Steinbach am Forest.
In order to handle this, early train and shoe blocks were needed, which had their home in pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 lokschuppen, teaching workshop, driving and mastering.
"Herzstück was the turning disc that had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirscheid, railway historian and 47 years of professional travel.
From the railway operation (BW) Pressig, which was subjected in 1968 to Bamberg, Loks for the sidelines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in pressig.
The electrification of the road in 1939 has already minimized the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977 they were used only in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 roads were still ranked in the month.
In 1982 parts of the work were cut off, 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not made better use of the site, even in the point of freight transport."
Even at Pfingsten 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a Pompey Train Station Festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Just a little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were taken off, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and Hemschuhlers did the most difficult work in the train," recalls Dinkel.
Any mishandling would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of both places and many other historical and current images are found here in the infraredPlus article.
Kerber with success in China Open
Peking (dpa) - Wimbledonsieger Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges had already.
Kerber defeated the Chinese Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or Spanish singer Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund conducted 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian assigned to number 13.
The swwabin is now getting to do with Anett Kontavit from Estonia.
During the series "Art and Joys" a special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the Freigeland of Dahlmann-Schmidt.
It takes place under the roof of the tourist association "Round around Walberla" in the series "Art and Pleasure".
She opened her wallets in the 15th year.
A great visitor's speech showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Meditehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He's been on his own since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself the main organizer and artist.
A bit surprised, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Angelke and Kurt Neubauer, he did his job in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already been active in the past in the selection of artists and have co-designed flyers.
This year, too, there is once again a 70-cent special brand designed by Kunst & Genuss, available at every art station.
There can also be designed by Volker Hahn this year's poster "Betzn Austanzen", which will be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high commitment of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler was able to be won from Nuremberg for the musical frame.
In walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately renders it playful.
They are made of metal or ceramics, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is expected on the right-hand side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, colourful, colourful, playful with 20 windmills, 24 capes and 24 alu tubes as soundpieces.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object seems palatable and invites to rest.
Barbara Washneck comes from Ekental, which is dedicated in three dimensional letters to the event of 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On a half-way Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind The Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy image of tone, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" is designed to fade through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers Celebrate 50th birthday party
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the Al-Bachans at that time made their shameless air.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find out everywhere that after the church's dissolution "Cácilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 albums from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It will be full today," said President Jürgen Holstige, and he should be right.
150 guests there was a real success for the Albachten singer.
It was for the anniversary that they had let the foundation feast come back to life.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.

Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full exploitation to the goal.
"We all know who's in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't break our genius.
I've seen a really good volleyball in the first place," Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the trip goes for the independent, it does not seem visible after just three days.
"It's just too early for this," says Axel Büring.
Only in one feels he confirms: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regionalliga volleyball. In the fourth league, they do not want to direct their views further down.

A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven parties.
On Saturday, it's only after Emlichheim.

About her husband to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the dream ship, Heide Keller became the star.
Now she openly says that the series might have been guilty of co-existence with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chefostest Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Treamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that led them to the star could be responsible for their failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she had been married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I was raised with this work, traveling alone with a suitcase around the world, and many of my admired colleagues took me for granted," Keller tells us in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
At first, she was always just "the wife of Hans of Borsody", but that changed with the dream ship.
Because now the journalists only call at Heide Keller's.
"If he likes it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it's possible that her husband at the time could have been totally rude, but "how many men also had his conversation about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried for Hans of Borsody "the only right one and he wanted to know my fears, not my weaknesses.
That's good German: I understand," she added.
She's always had the feeling "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I appeared on stage sometimes cheerful and courageous.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid it might happen a second time too".
On the day before the permanent trauma, I sat quietly in the wardrobe and wanted to give up everything.
The marriage of Borsody also escaped.
Why'd it never fit in with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller showed love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not daily.
I'm getting too naive to love."
The nightfaller, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has this time moved to the ZFF opening party.
Our fault is not a bribe, but a little light.
And the glow, in which a green carpet is carved on the sixth floor, mixes it with a fee.
But it is held film festival, where more or less famous people want to shine in the light of light.
So on this late Thursday evening, he will torpedo over the place to make it easier in the Aquaclean-WC-Oase.
This is called the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The necessary institution in the partnership of a new pavilion has a lot of work to do to boost a luxurious environment.
At this evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's Oasis for any reason to heaven.
So out here, across the other side of the street: Loaded guests who have just held the "Green Book" in the cinema next to the opening film at the best level celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey shop every year.
His name fits perfectly to this film festival: From all the earthball the works shown are known.
What does not have to happen to an article about this festival in order not to fall into a gender-based campaign for its 190 partner companies.
The fold binds itself with a belt around the felter, which had a good foothold attached to him, and two bullish doorkeepers actually swung him in.
Drinnen pushes the loads, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be presented by DJ rhythms to which they scream each other, and wash down with Cüpli exquisite hipps.
In the delicate shop in the subterranean, oysters are waiting for swallowing coins, next to which the unparalleled Rohschinken Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut off, a chocolate fountain is spreading.
And the hammer is: all the sales rules are completely exclusive products have not been cleared for the cause.
This has been the case for years, so it seems without great losses to work.
You must love this country!
The folder is studying the sign at the roll-step: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the roll-step".
If the two separate instructions were, he would have gone to the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the department of household goods at the summit, the birds pick up a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the Festival Award.
The price for the best drink does not necessarily get this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself.
And George Clooney, who's been buying the brand for years, is not here at night either.
However, between local prominence, cash and kitchen articles, there is a face over which the observer is known: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
It should not be far from his main contractor.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty-six acting like a chorus, walks through the crowd.
He's not being harassed, he's not getting caught, he's supposed to steal the most.
Just for this detention, like misunderstandings, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is happy about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home in Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as in a video already published on Saturday.

Handball: Verbal league 1: US Send to Last-Minute-Pleite "to the ground destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball bandlist Send the US, could hardly say: "So a bitter defeat". His shooters were "destructed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the game - on Saturday night at LIT Germany 2.
They had not played hard over long phases, as in Steinhagen, as against Hullhorst.
Only the initial phase "we've been totally asleep", the U.S. coach was upset.
Soon the housekeepers with 8:1, even the early time that had taken the ticket, did not fruit first.
"But then suddenly a dress went through the team," said Bielettsky for the second quarter hour.
For a break, the rest was only two doors.
Especially the best of sendes, Marius Hintze, met in the phase about another time.
After the change it was even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst left at 15:15, followed by the staff changer almost passed.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead still seemed to be a relaxing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Take the non-parties into the event.
Bieletzki tends to avoid seeking fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, which Steffen Mühloff cast, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four more times - while the tenth U.S. also stepped up in the last attack.
The boys fought great, and also against seven men stood well and threw them on the empty gate all the time.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to be here," said the restless beast Bietzki.
U.S. Towers: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlål (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühloff (2), of the Pol (2).

Bayern: woman has been missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the woman's mortal remains.
Used forces dig up a road on Saturday at Marxgrün.
The roadblocks and several layers have been reduced, as police and public prosecutors have shared.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far from his home at the time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
At that time, the investigator did not release a crime.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working with the State Prosecutor's Office on the case again intensively.
Together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Mental Protection Authority, the investigators were hit by a ground radar on a slope below the street at Marxgreen.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lie in the network.
However, users can also provide additional security.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has disappeared as head of the billion-thousand company.
He and the US Stock Exchange Supervisor SEC extrajudicially contributed to a legal dispute over misleading Twitter news, in which muscle could have lost the license to lead listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay every 20 million dollars, and for three years, Musk gives off the office of the Chairman, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain the head of the board.
In the comparison, which has neither to be confirmed by a court nor by a court, neither muscle nor Tesla's behavior is absent.
The SEC had accused the world-renowned manager of the United States court of Manhattan of fraud.
Musk, also known as SpaceX space company, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer who is currently rated at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not guilty
Musk told me he didn't do anything wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company out of the stock exchange and pay $420 per share to secure funding.
In this way, Tesla would have been assessed as a whole with 72 billion dollars.
Later, the music came back: Tesla stayed at the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find a Chairman from outside, set up two independent board members and set up a committee to monitor the Musk communication.

Investigations: 46% want Merkel not until 2021 as chancellor
After the sources of the past few weeks, the GroKo will cancel several survey dives.
The SPD falls in a survey behind the AFD - Angela Merkel is considered critical.
Berlin - The AFD has taken over the SPD in the Emnid-Sunday Strand for the first time on Sunday in the United States.
In the weekly survey of the Opinion Research Institute, the AFD adds a figure of 17 percent, the SPD gives one point in comparison to the previous week and ends by 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only get 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union on Sunday.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
If the federal elections were held on Sunday, the government parties would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
As a result, the Great Coalition has now lost the majority in the question of Sunday at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties reach 43 to 45 per cent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
At the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4 percent more.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AFD, in several surveys the second-strength party, is 15 to 18 percent.
Greens reach voting rates from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the vote.
But also the retention of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has been significantly slowed since the federal election in 2017.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office, as the Emnid inquiry on behalf of the BamS revealed.
Only every second (50 per cent) wishes the survey today that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 per cent being for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there were also significant improvements in the popularity of Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
47% are according to Emnid, 44% against.
As a result, 64 percent do not want a candidate, 35 percent do not.
Depending on Aldi: Reduced price for love luck
Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder, there are no romantic acquaintance stories anymore - that should be discussed at Aldi's meat.
Munich - In times of digital fast food dating through Tinder and Co., the supermarket broadcasts almost an anachronistic romance as a know-how place for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pot flesh, boxer shorts on the Wühltaltsk or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later single children than a simple sip to the right.
The app Tinder is called to be less a contact, but rather a sloppy stock exchange.
We have weighed the test: How do women react, but in the first message they don't talk for long around the hot Brei?
Here's the amazing result.
Normal Hollywood Lovestory potential has then, when the love luck is ahead of an out-of-the-eye loss-and-recovery plot.
If the type is still reported under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de at its offer, it sounds very good to Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch of ours wishes that she will also find her dreamer, with whom she has dealt briefly with the "30 percent reduced bio-puten meat".
For the faith in the magic of analog learning, she earned her Happy End à la Hollywood anyway.
Photoback: 500 lids for a life without fainting

The cause of polyomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be inflamed by vaccines, as is the case in a press release.

Football: District League: Research at the VfL Volbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this young season, as Alois Fetsch went to court with his heart.
He gave himself a word card, the coach of the football district boarder VfL Wolbeck, just moved back (inside) to sing about the missing performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running around the brandhove road again.
Taufrisher Belag is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Ages, in the past playing time only half-drenches on the rise crossed.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out each individual after the party to simply say "thank you" for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to perform a system shift after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - it came from the 4-4-2 almost intact into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting in front of the ball.
Wolbeck had significantly more play parts in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his aus (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the leadership.
Almost had this happened when the SCA, in 41 minutes, appeared dangerously before the Wolbecker case - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL often took full control.
Thewes of 18 meters was barely broken.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Tewes-Herein.
With the exchange of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed the left side again a fresh cell course.
When Chris Naber tree fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhouse, 18 meters before the guest house there was an indirect freeway for the square.
The Foult himself came on and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhouse" The thing with the right shoulder hit the bottom left from the view of the shield - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to get the hell out of here.
And then this: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck flew into the 80s.
Mr Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not leave the gift (79).
Bange had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase, before the geese in the 87th minute of 12 meters, but still had the victory match on the cushion.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhouses, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Report by the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rare figure in corporate leadership
As a result, only 8 percent of the executives were female until 1 September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and submitted to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to settle differently, otherwise the international competitors will move over to them," said Founding Director Wiebke Anchorsen.
In the United States, the UK or Sweden are purely male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - no longer possible.
The balance makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It's another business culture.
The small increase in women's share among German stock exchanges was also due to positive incentives for the medium-sized enterprises (MDax).
Although according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the executives are female.
However, in the previous year, the value was still 3.8%.
At the 30 Dax companies - in the past years, the women's share stagnated.
Last, 26 women worked in the offices.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again in the coming year - in their own interests," said Anchorsen.
The only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that there would still be no self-obligation to increase the share of "null percentage".
Another picture takes place at the supervisory councils: On 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 per cent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"In 2023, as many women were recruited annually, a proportion of 40 percent would have been achieved," the report says.

A user car is heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passerine was killed.
When notaries are called, they are supposed to help - save the best even human life.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn in the collision with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the notorist and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notarztauto had passed a red lamp on Saturday afternoon with Blaulicht and Martinshorn.
He then sat on a cross with the cab that drove to Green.
After the collision, the car slammed against an ampelmast and a tree.
He recorded the passenger who died at the accident site.
Driver of the notary car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be released from the service force.
The seriously injured 29-year-old nurse was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another rebuffed notarist tried this - however without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police find out in close consultation with the Bonner State Prosecutor, who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we make it uncomfortable
After the blasphemous Aus in the Ligacup Manchester United is now also lost in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat may still be spoken.
The scene was significant in the 74th minute, in which the restored Marco Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had probably led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside during Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's opponents remained, and Arnautovic left all the time in the world, the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative height of a previously far-reaching power failure.
It is quite different at the moment at the United City of Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos big competitors Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Howe Albion at a two-time victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team for the first time broke the alien's defense line.
Sergio Agüero took care of a good hour and a double pass with the former torso protection for securing the sixth victory in the seventh game, thus also for the jump to the table tip.
Liverpool no longer a table leader
Three days after the 1:2 descent into the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only hit of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation in 70 minutes.
It made Daniel Sturridge better in the 89th minute with his slender.
So after the Reds were started with a smooth balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and through the Remis in the League, the Blues Liverpool was still breaking out of the table top.
Like City, the two London City Clubs celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0 victory.
However, the fans of the Gunners, with whom Granite Xhaka was playing, had to wait until 81 minutes for a success report against the surprise team from Hertfordshire County.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart entered the door unlucky by Alex Iwobi, only two minutes later, Mesút Özil, with his third season meeting for the decision.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth victory, passed on to Watford and is again behind the great rival Tottenham on Rank 5. A strong impression continues to be left under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
At 2:0 against Southampton in the League, the wolves remained unbeatable for the fifth time in succession, bearing the 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Pariser car salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris motor salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet universally: The Diesel Canal and the ring for driving bans and equipment should not leave the German auto companies even at the meeting of the industry in Paris.
At the 2018 Automobile Salon, they will show their news from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not actually play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and replacement offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important subject at least behind the shining scenes of the trade fairs.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingol cities will come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarts 2019.
Officially, both of them have already been presented.
The next one of BMW is due to start in 2021.
The new 3er is centrally located in Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility and software providers are present in their own rooms.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 a million visitors were welcome.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunamis, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Tens of them are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 victims.
On Friday, the island was shaken by two earthquakes.
The first bee had the strength 5.9, the second was the strength 7.4.
Communications and transport connections are damaged, huge damage has occurred.
The Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the numbers of victims will still go to a very high level.
So far, the numbers have only come from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities - along the Sulawesis West Coast.
Some 150 bikers celebrate God’s service in Verdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Church of Peace in Eveking on Sunday.
Verdohl - The place before the church of peace in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
The final Goddess service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and is therefore responsible for the soul-surgical interests of the PS-strong dual riders.
Between April and September there is always the last Sunday of a month of the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at the house Nordhelle.
The end of the season the bikers traditionally celebrate in the church of peace in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bikers gathered to do something other than regular God’s service.
From 10 a.m., the bolidians were on their way to the entrance gate of the church.
At first, the biker breakfast shop was on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a strong currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
During the biker Goddess service, the sermon was held by Pfarer Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical meditation.
"Although the biker prefers the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is more of a poetic-silent sound," said Fr Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchttorfer Heimatverein celebrates a great feast: After the apple the milk comes
And even on the actual day of action Boris was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also of great interest.
He had his apple press in his pocket and demonstrated his standing audience step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and filled the apples in the big trunk.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely trimmed mass.
Still, many of the children could not imagine how they would once be a tasty drink.
However, they were also able to take a look at this important step on Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little apple pieces that look good like heckselling layer for layer over one another.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not that difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran into a large vessel.
However, the farmer farmed also had already completed specialties.
So he opened his "Schatzkiste" and presented the older visitors with the latest spring whites.
The demand for the good drop "made in vouchtorf" was accordingly large.
In a warm atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children were not only able to pursue the apple press process, but also discovered the built-in Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also active in the Füchttorfer Comrade of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited to some stations for short-term games.
Also in the coming year, the home association will offer a day of action.
Then, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home will not be in the heart of the Sparkle village of the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also because of the topic: finally it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season debate: "The situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga descent, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professional from Hannover 96 and spoke to them courageously.
However, many positives were previously seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Entracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-foot football pro Primer Schwegler and shuddered: "This is of course disappointing, because you always get a lot ahead of yourself."
The other Sieglosan Lower Saxonys, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) joined, are standing down with two numerators and in their current constitution are a descent candidate.
Guided by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) reached the door for the DFB Pocal winner, who, following the successful general test for the European League game against Lazio Rome, was shown seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's Vise-Worldmaster Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen and never got in the grip by Hannover's defense.
The long-slaper after the WM showed with its pace and enforcement capabilities why it is so valuable for the investigation.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who began to swear.
One of Lucas Torró's lost headballs on the tornet (17th) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was arrested in a searchable position at the last moment of the 96th rebellion around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) in the short term.
The leadership for the homeowners fell almost compulsorily and completely earned.
Philip Kostic picked up the ball after a rejected corner in the chest, Haller extended by head before the door where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first federal league meeting for the French second-party opponents AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still standing before the break.
This time Haller passed on his storm partner Rebic, who was able to think through and 96-Torwart Michael Esser left no chance.
In the half-time Hannover-Coach responded to the weak image of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
However, the Lower Saxonys now played a bit more bravely forward, burning ideas remained until shortly before the end, even though the connection meeting was still in progress.
The Hesses were much more efficient.
After an hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, which had to slide the ball into the empty door.
The rest was for the Frankfurter against the overloaded guests only upstairs, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix place will be in the middle of the country
In spite of the cold temperatures, a good mood prevailed at the October festival in the city center.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter created it before a million audience at the opening of 185.
Munich Wies'n in the last week with two strikes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christian Celebrate Saint-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14th or Sunday thereafter.
The holiday service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ, who comes out of the war of 30 years and is to have shot the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flows out of the gunshot wound.
From this, a great waveway developed to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not completed until today, only the old room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance of the Geisinger Pfarrei, the ministry was badly visited.
After the service of God, the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church and, in conclusion, the church part of the Crossfest ended.
For many years the Catholic Church has been inviting the world part of the festival to a Catholic parish.
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cooks and the weather adapted, farmyard.
In the afternoon, the parishioner also offered guided tours around the city church, and Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parishioner about the damage to façade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After some time the storm was already present, the damage could be found more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but it has also been more determined, which was only possible by the appearance of the eyes through thunder.
The sockel work has been completed, before the winter, it is still expected to begin with the natural stone work and we hope that half of these work will be completed this year.
Dedication: New residence in the New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Donau-Iller's life aid opens a new residence for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be given to its destination in the Münsterblikstraße - all those present agreed at the time of accession.
Finally, the 12 wheelchair drivers who have been living in the Danube-Iller residence for some time have been pointing to the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, flores and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas, Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army's office building was put to the test for the people with mobilecap: "The house had come in the years and no longer in time in the equipment," Bader said with a look.
In 2016, the bakers called on to demolish the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that its inhabitants can feel well, as the architect says.
Life aid Donau-Iller opens new residence
Around 4.6 million euros invested in the construction of life aid.
The state of Frestat was EUR 2.4 million, the county of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to Architect Bader, the construction works remained in the planned framework - in time as well as in financial terms.
He also thanked the managing director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagat between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that would allow the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without any help.
Similarly, the head of the Social Administration of the Schwaben District, Gertrud Kreutmayer, expressed himself: "The house is focused on the special needs of its inhabitants, who need help to be mobile."
The residentiality and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real accident because it is no longer to be acquired in the present situation."
Overall, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers an area of nearly 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities divided into three groups.
Stolz is a life-help manager, Heinz, on the eleven full-time staff who are all employed at the rate.
Germany: Swiss Claimed Differences Between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the day of the unity, the Deputy Vice-President of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all the people of the country, not to meet with the defeat of East Germany.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
With these differences we must not satisfy ourselves," said Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the "day mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked in an average longer than the people in West Germany, but 15 percent less pay.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German unity," said Swiss.
North Korea: Does this dirty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhund is going to smooth the roads between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngang has made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan-Jagdunds.
As Moons' office announced on Sunday, the two old dogs reached their recipient on Thursday for about a year.
They then crossed the border of Panmunjem along with three kilograms of dog feed to make it easier for the animals to enter.
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the National Cultural Good of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean mighty Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pjöngang.
Both countries also agreed to join together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to apply together for the release of the 2032 Olympics.
Kim also agreed to include the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives in the process of approaching each other.
Austrian history moved in mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year, many new books have been published, most of which answer this question in the light of the past hundred years.
In a very different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, will present Austria in the magnificent "Image Book" which will appear on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work - this is the informal motto for the Great Coalition's starting week.
Almost an interview, hardly a talk in which the Chancellor and his ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not yet mantraically declared the "back to the work".
This may have led some handicrafts, doctors, cashiers and other professional citizens in this country to the right question, which is what the difference is between work and work, but it is there.
If the Federal Government is now to devote itself to its task - to the government - now, it should not be stopped with the concept debate.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something else together after the provocations and beatings of the last few weeks, it may already be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the Heads of Government come together to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to remove conflicts early; a lesson from all the conflict.
First of all, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with diesel disarmament and the law on migration.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to allow the car companies to come forward with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to refurbish older diesel.
While an approach has been drawn up over the weekend in the Diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the proposed law on migration.
The SPD calls for a life perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "smuggling" of the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will again be a dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has joined the Groko, but three partners with a number of very different company figures and priorities.
The fight is good.
Without a dispute, a society drawn from such diverse, among other conflicting interests does not proceed.
But in order to be constructive, the dispute must not be raised again for partial reasons on the question of His or Nothing.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are to fight - but they always have the reality of people in view.
What is makeable and useful to many?
With this guide, both the diesel and the trace exchange question can be explained pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
This is why the People's Party must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour commit a violation of the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"True day and night" had worked on the reform of social security legislation, reported an overwhelming social minister at the presentation two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste-Pilz-Mandator Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is a surprise - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament through a request.
They assume that "the Minister only expressed his enthusiasm for the use of his team and did not wish to announce any violations of the applicable service right in front of current cameras".
However, they now have questions to be able to "freed from any suspicion".
Police are on a road looking for women's bodies
Marxgreen - Lange didn't want the police to express themselves.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state street between Naila and Bad Steben has been buried.
The route is still closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It had been predicted that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog trained specifically for the smell of old human bones, together with its leader, was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year now, the State Prosecutor and the Criminal Police have been working on the missing case.
Again and again, a bike path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspected that Heike's body could have been blocked 30 years ago in the train of the state road.
Colour powder and eggs: Krawale in Barcelona before Catalonia-year-old
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is held for the first time.
But before that, it's going to come to nothing.
The separatists have not forgotten the police practice since autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, it came to meet between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence officers, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers from the Police National and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in use last year at the referendum in the lobby.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from paying the vote, violence had also occurred at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the 6000 separatists, however, would have tried with violence to break the police code, and officials among other things would have thrown out with dyes and eggs.
Six persons were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, it was called to the authorities.
The independence referendum is the first time on Monday.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still sitting in U-Haft.
New elections were held in December.
Following the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But the new Regional President Quim Torra is also on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Upper Westfalls: Collected advicelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues to take place.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0 decision.
The final light and the third one opened up before 438 spectators at Heidewaldstadion as a collection of advicelessness.
The first half was observable from the entertainment factor.
Therefore, anyone who wanted to get a beer or a brat was able to do this unconcerned.
There was no danger of missing a torchance because there was virtually no one.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (unarmed) torschus of the whole party, Nick Flock was responsible for the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - option of the ahleners, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederick Westergerling was forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the fine line.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early shift.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced with a condition of injury, for which Sian Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the ever-increasing delay.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed almost 18 meters over the case and after an hour the goods were first exposed to offensive.
After a roundup of Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
The newly proposed counter over Sianan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a gun shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a head ball by Wieckowicz (66.) after an Eckball of ex-Alenar Tim Manstein.
RWA-interim trainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative did not bring the Ahleners to stand.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but they didn't bring in anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". Unfortunately, the zero also stood in front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against woodwives and even though our opponent didn't want to play here," observed RW Ahlen's Interim trainer.
Offensive "putting everything a bit" against a team, "it just wanted to defend.
I didn't have the feeling that we could get a opponent," said Daut.
However, as an observer of his suffering, he did not feel as if his team could shoot a door.
The idea was too polite.
Reckonfelder Ertedankmarkt: Luckily, there are enough Kreimers
The happy Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckonfelder table edition for which these donations are intended.
The Honorary Insurance: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky appeared brilliantly blue, and the space was still empty, but it should change during the day.
For, "It's so nice to be here, so we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the Feast Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a regular price humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be weighed down against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer are in a short time.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there's plenty of Kreimers.
And the "resistance" did not allow itself to be entertained by musically entertaining the ever-increasing visitors.
This happened so well that a few folk songs were played later.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to postpone the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many assets with their stands, including mainly associations.
"In fact, there should not be anything like a table," he thanked himself for the action of the Men's Choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were on the stand and also included the other parties held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town has a colorful anthrax - here's what's going on.
Then the Mikeranz was removed from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firearm and taken to the winter quarter.
On many stands it was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartfelt it was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, has been creative at his discovery.
He had some more work to do, a beer lid with Reckonfelder Motiveen and a few more.
A speciality was offered by three reckenfelder Immer: "Reckenfelder Honig", accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buchschlütter.
The last name still has a specialty.
Honey in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa always had to access, so well tasted the cakes.
Sociality is the one that allowed the visitors to stay for long to the evening, even without a stage program that does not exist during the autumn festival.
Smuggling with local political message: No successful advertising for skate facility
In Lengerich, strangers have spent hardly any form of funding for the construction of a skate facility.
Jürgen Kohne, from the city administration at the request of the WN, says in several places there are appropriate sewers.
In at least one case, a criminal case was filed with the police for damage to the case.
In large letters, the three words "Scatepark for Langerich" are applied to paintings at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the Hall, reports that after the Vocational Elections Fair on September 19th, a corresponding sign was discovered on the billboard at the step-up to the Gempt Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding in its time, they could have been removed without any problem.
"Just a few days later, however, it was there again, this time,," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising warrant must be replaced.
A special note is given just in this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the tax facility is built, it will also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises already exist, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the urban area of school, sport and culture, without names.
But it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the polluted table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the theme of the Skate plant.
After the old one was demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council spoke mostly for the firefighting park.
This idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building in this place.
At the end of June, a turning point followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is the City Council.
It leaves a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Engpass is getting worse when you fly
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European air traffic accident in the summer, German fleets do not see signs of improvement in the coming year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said the chief of the aviation security union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the air summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and delays in flights has been the long-standing staff note on European aviation insurance, for which there is no rapid solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade union officer.
Europe-wide, the market for pre-trained lotions has become empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, about one hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt, representatives of the federal, country, airport, airline and airport come together on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work coverage and overtime, it will not go without us," explained the Head of the GdF, who has many members in the case of basic German aviation insurance.
Maas again made the EU Commission's provisions responsible for the Lotsen-Missers.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been too low.
The cost requirements and staff savings resulting from this in respect of national aviation insurance are now fully applied to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to apply to Brussels for regulations that "do not block the air".
At present, the EU targets would be aligned by 2024 and there would be further aggravations to be feared.
The EU has been constantly exposed to lobby printing from the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now done exactly what they have been doing in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high cost of delay in the airlines will lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety (DFS) offers a "agreed training and future pact", Maas said.
So far, the announcement of a total of 120 lottery students over the next five years is sufficient to compensate for the old-age discounts.
The necessary staffing is therefore not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for group conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the Group.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp-interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group will be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their seat in food and be listed at the stock exchange.
An additional reduction in staff over the already known reductions in the administration should not be made.
After two withdrawals, the control body on the capital side only counts eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are against it.
However, the final decision is expected to take a major meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG the business is to be mixed with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos by policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous victims.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independence officials.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests away from each other with a big offer.
According to the use forces, however, independence advocates tried to break the security suspension.
They had attacked the officials with color and firing.
There were range lines according to the data also among the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better fees and respect for colleagues
The police wanted to honour the colleagues, who had held an independence referendum in Catalonia almost a year ago against the Spanish central government's ban.
At the same time, they asked for better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is wrong that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they deserve.
The demonstrators felt as a provocation that the Spanish police had demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan Protestant Manel Perez of the AFP News Agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they ruined us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearics, who only wanted to mention his name with Daniel, showed the suggestion back.
"Of course we want to support our comrades, who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is here to exercise our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more Echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British Minister
A security accident at a mobile app has led to the temporary availability of personal data by ministers and deputies of the British Conservative Tory Party on Saturday for everyone.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the Panne was announced one day before the Tory party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve Coach Praises Top Party: Ronaldos Best Game
The Portuguese star-stormer "played the best game this evening with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) - victory of the record master against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was also without its own door of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did good," said Allegri.
Even when we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first door - and from now on we have grown up.
Thanks to the three towers of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retreat through the hit of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and left the worst pursuer first.
The Torjagäger, taken by Real Madrid, first set up the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who took care of the leadership with a double package (26/49.).
And Ronaldo also performed the preparations for the meeting of the rebel chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had to move just before the torline.
"There are many templates," praised the coach.
But of course, Allegri also wants to see doors from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese National Team of Records.
"We need to get even better to serve him," asked the coach.
Best Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to be even more pressing.
Seven wins in seven games is the uncomfortable series in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the remaining seven years has already six numerators ahead of Naples.
The table range, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Anceloti, was not against Turin without chance.
But at the latest after the place of the already heated Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get on too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square.
"We have played well against a good Naples," said Turner Coach.
Imre Can could also feel threatened.
The German national player went through Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool was employed by all seven league parties.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying out of the square at the 2nd victory of the tournaments and was blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly scrupulous performance, Rapper Kanye West took care of the weekend at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live".
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water suit provided guidance and questionnaires for audiences.
The 41-year-old also announced a change of name to publish his new album on time.
Then you can only call him "Ye", so the musician.
"The Being, which was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in favour of the deceased singer Prince when he declared his artist names.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album already appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio transmitter KRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "du"," said the rapper.
Football: Circle A1 Pattern: Final!
Done!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not make a hero out of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was just more aggressive, we put him as well as never before in the face of problems." The list of Hotmar's possibilities is read accordingly.
Grade once two torscans in 90 minutes so that only rare games can be formed positive.
Football-Creisliga A1: SC Hotmar is subject to SG Sendorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schuckenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, the first one used Mike Krause from the top angle to lead the early (7).
In the 43th minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause he was released.
The hosts had only one double option as Moritz Höne at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and found his master in the post-supply Jan Blome in Sendhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) were all awarded.
A treatment meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the torline and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann also could not use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide scored the ball across the line was the party decided (81.).
"We had been criticizing ourselves before, that was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Gate: 0:1 Krause (7), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Circle A2 Pattern: Spectacle football in Albacht: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to keep from," he said.
"We don't even have access to it." With which he thought it was enough to fly the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but perhaps also all the other green whites that come with a collective offensive force.
However, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, bluffed and pulled from there his players was the relief to notice that they had pulled three points out of the deal.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, that is, albums, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fight for class content.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA-trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best season performance at a distance," he says.
"The way we get back after the 0:2, how we've been keeping up with one of the top teams of the league, that's already really phenomenal."
Even more bitter is the fact that you have to drive home with empty hands now.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the host with his 12th season meeting in leadership (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this door.
The 2:0 he put on the left side pattern for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew it, but such a player can't hold off completely.
"It was a nonsense what he had done," Lewandowski recognized the opponent's quality.
Shortly before the change of the side, his own elves made the compensation: McGills Freistot of the left sealed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through to the long toreck (45.).
After the page shift, it was again McGill who obtained the compensation (59.).
Then it went on and on.
It was a dumb, action-loaded game.
Nübel shook the albums again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite too much, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against sheep, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolf, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bone (87th Bareksai).
Doors: 1:0 Zimner (24.), 2:0 Frehning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Cloud (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow root: Atalan (74./Albachten).

Media: Full Bureau of Dynamo Dresden retired
The entire presidency of the football-secondaryist Dynamo Dresden has returned to media reports.
Several media agreed to a joint letter from the Sachsen Board in the evening.
First of all, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles in the former federal league.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pump
Good thing he's gone again.
There are only a few public guests whose departure in Germany provides for as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days was the Turkish President in Berlin and Cologne, and many thought that he should not have been invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
This is why France's president Emmanuel Macron has signaled to want to collect the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzings Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there to visit.
He was so proud of him that he said, "All the German presidents and chancellors were already with us," that at the Academy at the Tutzing Castle there were still prominent, but at the presentation of the annual programme there was also a topic.
At the end of October, singer Constantine Wecker took part in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann was at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's president Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to receive the "tolerance price" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives Dunja Hayali television moderator in another category (we reported).
The around 80 meetings until mid 2019 have it in itself.
"The rent is just not safe!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - the Academy describes the "risking and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting about Syria: "Barbarai without limit."
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war prevents every human idea."
From structural racism in society to radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum is sufficient.
The Academy Director Hahn was convinced that "a free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting of 200.
The birthday of Karl Marx will soon be expected to be one more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, the other rather a trend "from left-handed to middle".
What does it look like with neutrality?
"We are indeed 100 percent daughter of the Evangelical Church," said Dr. Ulrike Hakentel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music Cabaret: Gender understanding with Heart - Volbeck - Westfälische News
"Both for adults and for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Tebner on the Friday evening in the hall of the Church of Christ in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret, Tebner presented himself with the gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of the heart for the (sympathetic) woman and (sympathetic) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar introduced her and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben sat on the ground floor.
He is one of the male sparring partners, who, among them, comes to the conclusion of the sentence, and one of the true pianist: So congealed harmoniously accompanied by Suvrup Tebner, that some have wished for a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, just as it fit the red thread of the evening.
There Tebner had introduced a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would come out of the composition of Mozart, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
This is how suction in improvisations, from Bachs "O Head Full of Blood and Pains" to the "music of death", and from Mozart g-moll symphony into a played dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
The flowers were handed over by Karlheinz Kleintje, the treasurer of the association, the chancesonette.
However, the President Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept any additional thanks.
She had the idea that the Duo should also enjoy one in Wolbeck next to the performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women's Landing League: Ahlener SG maintains against TV Wattenscheid near the white West
The Ahlenirs had problems, especially with third-party player Caroline Stallmann, who only scored ten hits.
"In fact, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many doors.
We didn't get them in the grip," says ASG Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many opportunities he had left behind.
The concentration at the end left his team missing this time.
Therefore, the ASG was almost behind a stand until the end, left for the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.).
By the end, the broader bank of the guest pools had become crucial.
Aydogdu also placed the back room Merle Clement on the left-hand side, which then made "extreme clever the decisive door" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Clement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzzek, Ruschcapt (4), S. Fitzzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Food
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyballers of the BSV East Cup have re-established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
At the second-grader VC Allbau Food, the blue-whites were 3-1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
This is what we have been working on," said Trainer Dominik Munich after a nearly taddelless performance of his team in the stuttered table guide.
The first pass dominated the guests almost by love.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the Visemiers of the previous year at 25:15.
Lunch has been accepted in the twin line, but has not come into the game.
We've taken good care of them.
Our opponent has hit high risk, but also produced several driving cards.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "The food has turned the adoption into three lines.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Eating has grown up, and we've had a bit of fun," says Munich.
At 18:17 the volleyball girls had their noses in front of the rest.
At 19:24 and four bets, the fifth attempt, however, found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," the manager found himself at the rising level.
Mike Rüdingloh and, finally, Wiebke Silge made a significant contribution to the BSV turning the leaf in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munich: "That's where we played consistently and quietly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-white passage brought four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen to be the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also acquired an early day.
BSV women: Egghouse, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schniider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Moscow opening as missed chance
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the great ditib mosque in Cologne was dedicated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left in the German-Turkey relationship a scratchhead that can only be fought together with difficulty," said TGD president Gökay Sofuoglu, Germany's editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common, conceivable appearance.
"On the other hand, with German top politicians to emphasize the membership of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the term for its purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's finally a folk meeting time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln will already hold its fifth Nottuln People's Meeting in the fireplace of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day it's been a year since we first had a public meeting.
Meanwhile, this event has become a solid part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, president of the Nottulner Heimat Association.
I wouldn't have thought that our people's meeting was so fast in Nottuln.
Whether the stormy Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the office was always full.
"The program is always a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and sailing songs, folkongs, Evergreens and old battlers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always invited by friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first public "Birth Day".
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the nearby district of Steinfurt, who played music with German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The fans of the festival remember the last event in summer when Christoph Schulz from the Emsdetten folk meeting with his international version of the song "Frösche in the Night" thrilled the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We count on many happy guests to spend a pleasant and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the Home Association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join.
Since the desired seating positions are always fast, it is recommended to be there in time.
The public meeting begins at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 19.00 p.m.

From Pure Crop to Ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stamberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Association for Garden Construction and Landing was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in Kullbacher Association, the last founding impulses were set up for the Kulbach District Association and Landespflege Kulbach, and just 125 years later, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
At the time, he was free to say otherwise: "As a Bezirksobauverein Kulbach City and Land", he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
Also, the purpose of the fruit-making community was different from today's work - it actually went clean around the fruit-making, about flowers and garden-making at that time, no one thought about it.
"At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite son of the elite," explained circuit overseer Günter Dippold in his performance.
Fruit trees should fall off the road, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
The building is still the task of the 55 garden construction associations in the Kulbach district, which includes almost 7,000 members.
However, this does not allow the spectrum to be exhausted in the long run.
A natural garden building, biological plant protection, village decoration and food play a large role as well as the media of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
As diverse as the task areas of a garden building association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwurfe" were entertaining at the stage.
"The youth work is particularly urgent in the digital age," said the circuit president Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature were for life.
The Kastanien collection was a huge matter for our children, I doubt that you can gather much joy similar to that of smartphone & co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the Jubilee.
"Where they are to stand, the Association of Circles decides," Landrat Söllner added and highlighted the special importance of the Garden Building Associations for the villages.
The circuit association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening societies in the countryside also left no doubt as to the fact that there was no doubt about this.
He led the many visitors with a presentation through the long history of the circuit and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Before that, everything came out of the garden, for which winter it was intruded.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the useful garden turned into a garden of land and habitat.
"The nature has existed, it was already before us and we have to focus on it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
That is why it is necessary for the gardening societies not to leave behind so that our home will remain beautiful and vital.
It also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added.
"We must stop the ecstatic decline in insects, which we owe our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful festival, which was celebrated by the turbulence of Thurnau.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canadian Foreign Minister for Foreign Affairs
Mexico's government wants clarity in Nafta matters: they provide the two trading partners with an ultimate for an agreement.
The Foreign Minister of Canada is now giving the Trade Agreement an absolute priority and shifting its speech to the United Nations.
Due to the press release of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland moved her speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations Full Assembly, her speaker, Adam Austen, told her.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo stated on Friday that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the United States.
In August, the United States and Mexico agreed to a recast of the Regional Free Trade Agreement with Nafta.
US President Donald Trump pointed out that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new site have been going on for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (place time) they are to be brought to the conclusion, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the case of a failure of negotiations, Mexico's appointed president, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that a bilateral agreement would be reached with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a mass attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his resignation, it is still unclear whether 63-year-olds will be performing public performances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
At the beginning of September, the politician was attacked on an open road during a campaign in South Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele no" (in German: "The Not") women's associations had especially called for protests against the former military.
Even in the social networks, the associations made racist and women-respective statements mobile against Bolsonaro.
Thousands of demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo metropolis.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests mixed with a statement of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the position of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore should not apply.
The presidential election in Brazil was held on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the millionth city of São Paulo, Haddad was still far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the Brazilian trumpet has long been involved in the political operation, it presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a single election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful out of this - no matter who he comes against.
Bolsonaro is known for hating homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked with verbal discharges.
Another time he said the followers of Lula's left working party should be shot.

The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen shared on Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician has been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen became known to the band Gasolin', which was extremely successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as solo artist.
He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
Its "Midt om natten" album from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Löcke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "the street kids", which was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the Monarchie-Gegenner Larsen was born on the 70th day of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at air pressure level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and burn a concert evening with the strength of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" lay such a description of the rock live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the city centre shoe factory: Hardrock pure of three other friends.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no trace of the lamp fire.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Olde - with their bands loud voiced the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The Quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to start the concert even with the latest, unknown pieces of their own feathers and the next-looking CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to the vocal and printed interplay of the band.
Although "Tiger Bonsaw" calls are not to be heard, then leave the stage to the Trio "Here We Stand".
That hardrock is not the same hardrock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Holscher with her alternative, sometimes in classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" comes with "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, which is also a synthesiser for use.
Not only the curious, just balladish "Take Me Home" exists through the exchange of melodic passages to the guitar-rich rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnish Houses has since its founding in 2005 played a special level of popularity.
Full agility the band presents its hard print on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" with its performances before a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tournee in China from 2017 - has special stage experience, is obvious and unheard of.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts his own accents in conjunction with the band during the evening's only covered song, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
At the same time, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers even more out-of-state sound than before, while he is running through the audience with a cheerful solo.
Of course, a certain volume is part of this hardrock concert: The "Mint Mosquito" rock night is the sound of the mixed team at the trier concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonsaw" and "The Ignition" at approximately 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of the press air chamber, but it is still clearly under the control of the Wacken-Fesitvals, the "The Ignition" on their website.
Earwashing 120 decibels in Düsengrieufaustung as usual for the annual metal steel dichin in the north of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rock-like gang have at most convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bones and burned a concert evening with the strength of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transferred sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A fatal accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen airport there was a fatal accident.
A sailplane crashed on Sunday at Mülheim/Essen Airport on a parking lot.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near the airport Mülheim/Essen there was a fatal accident on Sunday.
As reported by the "West German General Newspaper", a sailplane was crashed at the exhibition park at the airport.
The pilot came to life.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the pilot was alone on board - the pilot is supposed to be an intruder.
The aircraft has already been on the landing trip at the time of the accident.
The stop is only close to a stop at the airport.
But since this weekend, an October party will take place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr districts and directly on the road to motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at large events in the fair of Essen or Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump lifts Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that North Korean President Kim is perfectly well-founded despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
Now Trump has made his colleague a regular declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married president of the U.S. has known himself as a new flame.
The tragic: It is a remote relationship.
In all public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean power Kim Jong and on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old Sprout of the ruling dynasty from Pjöngang, although in the ring around North Korea, he proved to be quite close to fractures.
"I was dumb, he was also, and between us it went and here," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversation with Kim would have caused his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also brought political fruits: Trump referred to the stop of all atomic and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics still see little more than lip recognitions.
The fact that the affection for the "Rocket Man" announced by the Mortal Drohems - so Trump's name for Kim - should not be to everyone's liking - seemed to be entirely conscious to the US President.
In any case, he took the necessary criticism of it when he appeared in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling immediately: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so unpredictable.
But he was worried about it very little, Trump explained and pointed his fingers to the multitude of people: "I always told you it's so easy to be president."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there to push into this arena filled with will, but we'd only have 200 people out.

Refugees Thanks to video saved from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya by means of a mobile video and thus enabled their salvation.
The group had turned the recording into their cell in the coastal city of Savija in July under life threat and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said one man in the video message.
We're sorry here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors warned the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Finally, the refugees fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efé Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he took his own statement to risk his life.
One of his rivals was beaten almost to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrines.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees who are beached in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes using the program this year, the IOM spokesperson in West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now saved was not exceptional in view of the bad prison conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a phone video assistant.
International organizations have been criticising the situation in the Libyan refugee camps for a long time.
The North African state, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main country of migration for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the People’s School on Sunday afternoon to prepare her teaching for Monday, she surprised a offender.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the 1st floor, she saw a man running straight away.
Only through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there through a ladder into the ground or the front seat.
The teacher understood the police who recorded the investigations.
Whether things have been stolen or money has not yet been said.
Description: about 16 years old, black, quite short hair, somewhat darker look, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please refer to the Police Inspector Obernberg am Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.

Laschet encourages the rule of law in Turkey
In his interview with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr Armin Laschet (CDU) President Erdogan, called for legal status in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries were currently "overestimated", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, in particular, the wave of arrest, the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to be normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important condition.
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans who were in prison in Turkey, according to his own statements.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of opinion would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan was held in a short-term building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at the Wahn Castle - this had been denied by the inmates of the castle from political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the talk.
Laschet had refused a joint performance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact partners - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of North Korea's negotiations on denuclearization, the Ossetian regime represents the conditions of greater urgency.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a settlement in Washington.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed the US government in the UN General Assembly debate to block negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest stop is therefore that the United States is building on forced measures that are deadly to the formation of trust," said Ri in New York.
Equipment for North Korea is indispensable under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will disarm ourselves as first," said the North Korean diplomat.
The fact that North Korea's criminal measures could force the "knie" to be "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an atomic test site, Ri emerged.
On the US side, however, there were no "reactions", the Minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council had decided three times last year on sanctions against the international isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in the past days forced the United Nations to comply strictly with the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working towards an approach.
For the first time in June, Trump met North Korea's mighty man Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President seeks a second summit with Kim.
In October Pompeo will again go to talks about the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme to Pjöngang.
The HoT is served: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door Hot got nothing with: White blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the resurrection Goddess Service.
The young people of HoT had a wonderful buffet with deliciouss from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves for the food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalled.
We had already filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were prepared on the great day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power crash had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was ruined and had to be taken away.
"Now we had to start from the front: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to create it on their own," said Westbuer.
And that's how they all got together.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Better can't cook," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido basket soup was served or guests could serve Quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what children and young people have put on their legs," said Father Frank Beckmann, while magic Stephan Lamen with cartoon tricks and other art pieces for surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW national board
From hunger on criticism from its own ranks, the chef of the Essen table, Jörg Sartor, has given up his posts in the country association.
Sartor had become known throughout the United States as the Essen table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice-Chief of the NRW tables, Sartor said of the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in the back.
The head of the NRW Board of Country Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing representative.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor.
"I can follow his step - there are people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table is doing this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, there is nothing going on," said Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday", Sartor criticised colleagues from other tables.
You must not pursue the approach, "without us starving people in the city".
It is the task of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
At a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essenes did not participate.
"I'm told too much sweet smell," he said.
There are all these social vulnerabilities that have criticized me at the time.

For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal leaguer.
On a 20-metre flat shot of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second one after an hour.
However, the trends at Gladbach are quite heated.

Macedonians agree on new national names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens today agree on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
With one yes, the nearly three decades-old conflict with neighbor Greece could be resolved.
Athens had remained on a change of name because of its so-called northern province and blocked every approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could soon become a NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, they gave the Jawt.
A registered life partnership was not questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" section.
"If we get married, then we're right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a national political speaker of the SPD Federation and one of the speakers of the Seeheim County, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs made a serious observation on 30 June 2017.
So he had proposed to Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stopped" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in action on the accidental announcement of the DDR frontier opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, homosexual couples have been able to marry just like Heterosexuals.

I was well-prepared, I had enough rides on this site and it's been all right today," said the London Olympics third party in 2012.

Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - this is what breakers want to make use of.
So the police inspector Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break up this autumn.
The fact that it was left at the family house on the Kingswiss Street is due to the alarm system.
This went away when the perpetrators placed their hand on Friday just 20 hours ago.
The offenders realized that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm was apparently surprised by the fact that they took the escape without delay.

Pleite at Hertha: Taken from the reality: Bayern v. Ajax requested
The predicate is unbeatable: The Netherlands in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not to fall".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small part of the new coach Niko Kovac will never increase to the larger autumn depth for the Munich.
"One week ago you had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we've got a little bit of a reality," noted Thomas Müller after the earned 0:2 down at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us knows that we're really upset and that's why we're giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year outside, no door has been shot by itself, as at the same time of the preseason two duty games in series without winning, the table run in the football league first lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the end phase of the corrupt Carlo Anceloti at the end of September 2017, the recordmaster has to be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running man-op-man tactics and the Berliners, through their playful fingertips over the outside, have delivered within three days two blowouts, as the last ones that appear too powerful yet can be knocked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything to make us successful again," Kovac stressed.
On the other hand, he and his losers in his hometown were surprised to see his first defeat as a Munich coach only at the once again incapacitated treatment with chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday before the country's game break would still make the first intermediate phase of his office seem to be positive - otherwise the sound may be sharpened.
Thus Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second class of the season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday begins as planned the short preparation for the second pre-war game against Ajax, which also had a sovereign appeal to AEK Athens.
"Now it's got us in two games, but we'll also make our doors again," announced Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost pokal finale against the Intracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich Putuxt spoke mainly.
The lawyer acted as a mahner.
"I don't think that this is all Pech, we need to work it out again, because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes back," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh game day of the previous game time, even the Bavarians were behind Dortmund with five counters, which now took over the top again with a point in advance.
Kimmich, at least with a eyebrows, welcomed the fact that the public debate on the allegedly unbeatable Bavarians has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schussline: Özil-Cousa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish President Erdogan, with heavy presuppositions, urges an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
Although DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, he defends the alliance line.
Now a new post should be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the high repute in the permanent battle theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the relationship with the former world champion in Cologne to open the big ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB leader defended the alliance line.
On the early Sunday morning, the personally sharply attacked Grindel in Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio" announced the consequences of the case.
"In the future, we have to draw very precise conclusions - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U teams - that this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as other integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
With sharp words, he had pushed a racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
We were born in Germany and raised in Özil and our Ilkay.
They have separated them from this society because they were able to take pictures with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the city.
To be honest, I couldn't say as her president that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that he felt "appreciatively treated by the DFB" by photos of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm Migrant - that's not right.
"That he has such an impression, I am very sorry," said Grindel.
We should have defended more at the moment, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of Özils to the national team.
As a follow-up, an additional integration officer will be appointed in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person with no migration background clearly influences society and football and says, "The topic is important, we need to take care of it," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil affair, he wants to re-apply to the office as DFB President in the coming year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said.
Annual builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accident on Friday between 10 a.m. and 13 p.m.
The 75-year-old driver was first addressed by a lady on the red lamp in the area of Lauter's height.
She told the tenant he was driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of staff, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady on the parking lot.
A short time later, a telephone message went to the police about a driver who was coming down from the street and was driving against a driver.
On that point, the man didn't want a police officer on the spot and then ran away from it.
After that, the Rödtaler drove home.
However, in his home, where he lives for decades, the tenant has had a procedure and a vehicle in turn.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a wrong impression and couldn't feel much anymore.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1,000 use forces in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal site in Emsland, 980 people are still employed with the destruction work.
This was shared by the German army on Sunday.
As the situation continues to be stable, 70 honorary helpers have been withdrawn.
Another reduction in the number of use forces is planned, that is.
On the night of the sun, an Upper Earth fire was discovered and destroyed.
Last week the disaster was lifted, which was well known a week before September 21st, because it was feared that the flames would put at risk forests and settlements adjacent to the wind and radio flight.
On Thursday it was said that an overcrowding of the fire on adjacent communities was no longer a threat.
On-the-spot attempts were made to get more than 1500 firepowers under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Federal Defence Forces at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Federal Defense.
For the 2nd and 5th October, according to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also scheduled again.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde left the main church of St. Katharin in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, they gave the Jawt.
A registered life partnership was not questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" section.
If we get married, that's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a national political speaker of the SPD Federation and one of the speakers of the Seeheim County, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs made a serious observation on 30 June 2017.
So he had proposed to Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stopped" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in action on the accidental announcement of the DDR frontier opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, homosexual couples have been able to marry just like Heterosexuals.
In the past, they had been able to enter their lifelong partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
The referendum in Macedonia began over new national names
In Macedonia, the upcoming referendum began on a new name for this small Balkan state.
About 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state will be called in the future North Macedonia.
This is because of its so-called northern province of neighboring Greece.

Switzerland starts electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still only be taken with express consent, notes Swiss transplant.
(dpa) Switzerland starts an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in case of need of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - can only be taken with express consent - stress Swiss transplantation.
It is estimated that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donation certificate, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases will a map be found at the crucial moment when possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They then have to decide, in the sense of the deceased, what is often very burdensome," said Always.
A similar registration system exists already in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Health Information Centre, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can record their wishes - per or versus organ donation," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn spoke for a reorganisation of the organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as organ donors unless he or his or her relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects it.
14-year-old student is the world's champion in fear
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in head fear.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 rivals.
Martina Flamme-Jasper told the science museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany gave the third place.
The youngest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, who was the 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Chief Justice Ralf Laue said.
The IT professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
For example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon when participants came to the audience with pocket computers.
Wenzel's greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Welcome to Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With terms like superhero, genius or wonder child, organizer Laue can start little.
"He can train," he said.
Many participants spent several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even accounting competitions aimed at stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root of six-digit numbers.
In terms of diversity, candidates receive a surprise task for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans had good chances, the chief judge said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because they are already more intensive and effective in early childhood.

Polar cold air brings to the mountains in the West Neuschnee
For the first time in the West, Mrs. Holle will shoot her bets: Polare Kaltft will reach Montag Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg.
According to the Meteorologists of the Center for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit decreases at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can be cut down by a strong intensity of up to 1,000 meters, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the High Towers it is estimated to be above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of snow.
On higher passes (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Height, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauren, Großlockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore winter.
Farmers may start on Monday with the annual scissors
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual Knickcare on Monday.
The unique "green waves" in Germany have been marked for about 200 years by the landscape of the Waldarmen Federal Land.
The trees and shrubs up to five meters wide are the "Walderset" and for many animals and plants the last retreat spaces.
Knicks connect as a corridor located living spaces, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as said the managing director of the German Natural Protection Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living columns
The Knicks were held on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living columns" were not only field limitations and pastures, they also supplied the farmers with fuel wood and beams for their trade houses.
From that time on, his name "Knick": Through "Knick" the axles were able to develop the dense, falsified boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the East Sea, some 45,000 kilometres of the Hectics are extending the image of a woody, multi-structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are currently used by about 7,000 species as replacement living space.
In one kilometer of Knick they could live up to 1800 different species and break up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained in winter.
In other words, he cares for a light tree line that also incorporates the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Knickcare may be operated only outside the time of pregnancy from October to March.
According to Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesiai, talk about the situation on site
In the interview with the editorial network of Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi after earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on your own during the Tsunami?
No, I was just at the time in Jakarta on Java Island.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
There I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport was closed to Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be provided.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also brought other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are referred to surrounding hills, where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some stand up in front of their houses, there are still remains.
Because many food shops and even tanks are completely closed, people are partially gluing food and gasoline.
The public service is completely undermined, and the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partially free and searching for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provision running on the island?
At the moment, we received a phone call, but before, it didn't work, and we only got information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, from whom they do not know whether they live and where they stop because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but for example on the road to work.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought, "Okay, no Tsunami," and then he came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they are referred to the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We normally know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is broken down, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

A muscle bundler rice usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rice usually heals a little faster.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned acquisitions is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the high-level majority for the court candidates in dispute due to the needs.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators to explain the necessary events that lie behind more than 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama about the calling of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, in which, in the course of the case, there was a riot against the opposition Democrats, the Senate's judicial committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of the Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly stated against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
His party friends were allowed to enter the scene.
President Trump, who still referred to the difficult maintenances on Thursday as "beschiss", first came up with further attacks on women and said on the contrary of "luck in the accident".
In this way, the last doubts could be cleared out, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats in an election campaign because they refused Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy".
Trump ordered an FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
A government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the town municipality of Ried for monitoring the tempolimitis is stationed on the garden road, according to the city municipality from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The city community also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
Nevertheless, the factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball inside.
And there were many corners and many balls in our chest," said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
Finally, the king's blue was still able to bring the barely 1:0 against the Rheinheses over time and thus bring the first season victory under roof and box.
It could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11. the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given security, Tedesco said: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and by the press.", with increasing playing time, apparently more and more the head played a role.
Don't actually create a headball memory
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept retreating.
And defends men and mice against Mainz.
To save the first three figures of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said the Creator, who had no significant share with his baseball match: "I am actually the worst ball player in man".
But in the end, it's only the victory.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," Schalkes Chefcoach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to approach parties in over 90 minutes
The biggest manko of the afternoon: Kingsblau missed it rather for a clearer relationship to worry.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen complyanka, which twice met the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a victory," said Tedesco, "you've already felt a bit of fear."
That's why I'm glad we won.
So he wasn't the only switch.
Fishbachau: Smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke wasn't to be overlooked.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on eye height
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, is standing in front of them.
He is followed for the repeated invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I've been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and president of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates in the direction of the evening with the "Cultural Policy" alliance.
El-Mafaalani goes up very slowly in the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, hand-resistant numbers and some joke, he brings the listeners one of the most controversial themes: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasingly emerging despite successful integration?
The Syrian author serves in answering the question of a metaphor.
On a table, the German society, on the cat table, is the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat on the big table and want to agree.
That leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether to join the political right or to the left, but rather, "Am I for or against an open society?" he stresses.
First of all, the round of discussions is going on more and more.
And there's a need to talk.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, telling two teachers how they see successful or uneducated integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands for, not on stage, a picture of the discussion: it is on eye height.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, stresses that he speaks from the average, not from individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the next signatory hour, he continued to have an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively discussed.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is obvious: more than 100 interested people have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Plining sold the first plots in the New Landsham-South area on the free market.
This is shared by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that offer the municipality with more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous home model.
Good 100 applications were received, so Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Plininger Mayor, the goal is to have the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots until the end of the year and to present it to the municipality.
Then the forgiveness can be made.
In total, 50 plots are created for single and double houses on the south of Landsham and four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight housing units each.
The solution is now as good as finished, the roads and roads will soon be asphalted.
A single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Plining.
It sells most on the free market, 20 plots in the social model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family homes of the municipality are to be built as a affordable living room.
A total of 16 apartments funded by the Free State.
Place for 200 people
Grave is estimated to be built on the surface of the New Landsham-South residential area for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, beginning of October, Frick is taking place there, according to Frick, the start for the new construction of a children's living place.
It is intended to accommodate three groups of children's gardens and three groups of mushrooms and a multi-purpose space.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019 for the beginning of the next kindergarten year.
So Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also succeeds at the bank
For the third time, not in the beginning elf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Kelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time, not in the Schalker Startelf, but in the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-metre Brazilians had spoken so correctly of the hunger of the soul.
But when the Schalker players, after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual, gathered in the middle circle and thanked Chief Coach Domenico Tedesco at all of his professions, the 36-year-old, whom all the simplest half of Naldo, said, "We have to thank Coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist appearance, did not hold any interest.
I guess Naldo, who was celebrated as the best switch in the past season, knows that he has actually not been on the track of his coach - but has been given a break for good reasons.
It's a reason for this.
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him what I'm telling you honestly," said Tedesco about the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the beginning.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco reasoned.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that all of us can get through right now.
And that we all keep on the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that Naldo has achieved recently.
And the Brazilians responded to the wisdom of his advanced age: by also becoming a exemplary champion at the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its speech in August compared to the Eurozone.
The purchase manager index (PMI) was on a 37-month stand with 46.7 points.
However, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, Austria still has the third best mood, the Market Institute reported on Monday to its survey of some 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area’s SMEs rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, thus the index is still under the 50-counters’ brand of growth in the 13th month.
The only Irish industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, however, slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened speech could mean that the worst is over," said market economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains one - in the third quarter anyway - growth brake number.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the Eurozone have fallen as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in subsequent positions.
Also in China, industrial production fell stronger in August than at first.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had expected 47.8 points first.
The purchase manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
These include developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices.

The Brazilian Neymar brought the PSG into charge after 22 minutes and ended up in the playtime.
For the intermediate 2:0, Christopher Nkunku (46th).
Thus, Paris also achieved the general test for the leading second league team game against the Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To set up the royal class, Tuchels team at 2:3 in Liverpool had to take up the only duty play in this season.
