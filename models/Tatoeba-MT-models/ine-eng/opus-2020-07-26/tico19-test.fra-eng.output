Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly across all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of patients with COPID-19 in need of care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a home of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported to Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the agent responsible as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been baptized as a result of the SARS-COV-2 infection.
To date, about 80 per cent of people with COPID-19 have a mild condition, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 causes a more severe wound requiring hospitalization, while 6% of remaining cases develop a serious form of disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COPID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it with the evolution experienced by the Province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020, Spiterie et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe following the definition of WHO cases.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 by persons coming from Wuhan, in the Province of Hubei, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (USA) with 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CPCM), the number of cases reported in each country worldwide, only from official sources such as health departments, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
This data was used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country by 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of the Province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase in the area of 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This trend was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries presented a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 presents the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
At 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 increases rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for the purposes of the confirmation of COPID-19, including for routing tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COPID-19 cases in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (not reported).
However, a systematic collection is needed to complete the current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010–11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in the services of intermediate and intensive care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds for 100000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios relating to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COPID-19 hospitalized cases associated with a risk of > 90 % overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth fast update of the COPCM risk assessment for COPID-19.
Given that the cases have so far been grouped in certain EU/EEA and UK countries, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be established at Level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore prepare themselves for a community-supported transmission scenario of SARS-COV-2 and an increase in the number of patients in need of care, particularly intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by moving from a rigorous approach to a mitigation approach, insofar as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing has been implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window during which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without that, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have to deal with a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the days or weeks to come.
The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-COV-2), has thus led to more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
As its counterpart, SARS-COV, which led to thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-COV-2 could be transmitted by mice and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, the COVID-19 presents a severity and mortality lower than the SRAS, but it is much more transmissible, and it affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this subject of research.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will participate in better understanding and eradicating this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, has always marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain closed for the entire golden week and for many other weeks because of the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) epidemic in 2003; that is why it was baptized SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly to China all over the world before it extended to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 work has been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review tries to synthesis the progress of research on this new subject in full.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronary disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and we will address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-mortal pathogens for humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of the common rhums 4.
During this century, however, we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-COV and MERS-COV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemic of recent history coronavirus.
As shown in Fig. 1.1. of the then unknown-origin pneumonia homes were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spreading to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan marine fruit market, considered the starting point of the infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified for the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of the drafting of this report, the disease had already spread to China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
To the extent that the situation is rapidly changing, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study conducted in 8 866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases, presented an updated overall view of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but more frequently in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and on the periphery.
The mean time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COPID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration of onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, which coincided with the massive movements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the overall mortality rate was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors of COPID-19 were sex (male), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large virus enveloped containing a simple brown RNA.
They can be classified into four kinds, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the man belonging to alpha and beta.
The glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope is associated with angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and dipeptidedyl peptidease-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-COV and MERS-COV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released in cytoplasm; after replication of the viral gene, the genomic RNA is accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vescules containing viruses, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
It was established that SARS-COV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% of genetic identity among 10 sequential samples taken on the site of the epidemic origin, the Huaan fruit market in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
Using the transmission electronic microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of respiratory pathways.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a recipient of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV.
However, the S protein of SARS-COV-2 is related to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-COV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes a less significant infection than SARS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by Orf3b and a secret protein coded by Orf8.
The SARS-COV-2 Orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the Orf8 does not contain known functional areas or motives.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 Å complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of diamond and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
The B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug cribling in order to eliminate the infection in SARS-COV-2.
The original host and the intermediate host
It was established that SARS-COV and MERS-COV were sourced from mice and that they were transmitted to Man through the civets and chameledes, respectively.
Due to a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, mice have been advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses called bat-SL-COVZX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect Man remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still elucidating.
Ji, et al., released the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted from mice to Man by snakes, which would involve a homologous combination within the protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangoline - a long-muscle mammals feeding on furmis, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the mid-term host of SARS-COV-2 if judged by genetic homology of 99% between a coronavirus discovered in the pangoline and SARS-COV-2.
However, a 1% gap between the two genomes is a difference of importance; it is therefore necessary to wait for the final results to establish concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties very well.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-COV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-COV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to studies previously carried out on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the immune system inferred from it through molecular-cause recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lecine receptors, type Toll receptors (TLRs), type NOD receptors (NLRs) and type RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
By various means, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N-protein of SARS-COV may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Support T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to severe lung injury and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multi-visceral failure, or death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is widely accepted that persons exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more at risk of being infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-COV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more than 3 to 7 days after a study in the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study conducted in 1 099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a population of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine after the most precise incubation period, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic individuals from transmitting the virus.
In general, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and can be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, suffocation, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhoea, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients presented dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
As regards serious cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiographic anomalies, should be tested for the virus in order to allow an early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Similar findings were reported by two recent studies conducted on a family and on a home that appeared following the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-COV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% needed ventilation assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which was consistent with higher COVID-19 mortality.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat disease (21%) were also observed in patients with SMR.
As regards SARS, it was established that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat disease (13%-25%), and that ventilation assistance was needed for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent, for 66,576 worldwide confirmed cases.
In contrast, the mortality rate of SARS in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8 096 confirmed cases.
According to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, for the MES, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-COV-2 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 95% from 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-COV reached only 2-4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-COV-2, MERS-COV and SARS-COV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggests that SARS-COV-2 has a more important capacity to spread than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than it has been for the ERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a assembly or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected regions, or have been in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks prior to onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be virus carriers without symptoms for more than two weeks and that restored patients may again be virus carriers, which underlines the need to increase the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COPID-19.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin in the blood, and most of them had an increase in C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the rate of D-dimmer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes decreased gradually.
Anomalyses of thoracic radiography are found in most patients with COPID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or a depleted glass opacity at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in the surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, reducing the capacity of the lungs to drown and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying thoracic examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a breakdown of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multinuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of a deceased patient, which coincides with viral infection and SDRA pathology and appears in patients with SRAS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 DNA through a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative fraud, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical backgrounds, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a SHERLOCK technology-based protocol for the detection of SARS-COV-2, which identifies synthetic fragments of SARS-COV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) with the help of a reactive tape within an hour without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practice, if its use on clinical specimens would be conclusive.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with COPID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of restored patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients was proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-COV-2 primarily targets the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure constitute the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used to treat heart or respiratory critical deficiencies.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, and protecting the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-COV-2.
An excessive response from the immune system has been identified as a cytokine shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody anti-IL6, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokines include modulation of the immune response by T cells, blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokines 4 signal suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of RASS in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids has not had a beneficial effect on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would have serious side effects, including a vasculal osteonecrosis, which would significantly affect the prognosis.
However, careful use of low-to-moderate short-dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with a severe form of COPID-19.
At the time of drafting this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COPID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
As a result, remésivir has also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-bred RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead has transmitted the composition to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-COV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other undesirable effects may occur following combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of restored patients and production of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, restored patients often have a relatively high rate of anti-pathogenic antibodies.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralise them directly.
Plasma was thus removed from the blood of a group of patients who were cured from COPID-19 and injected into 10 severely affected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in combination with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated abnormalities should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of the immune response and lead to a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
Blood antibodies are generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies sufficiently quickly to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate the B cells of restored patients and identify the genetic codes with the relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the major proteins of the virus.
This would quickly increase the production of antibodies.
The MTC has been used since the millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on MTC theories.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
At present, due to the absence of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, the MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best treatment rates for COVID-19 were observed in Chinese provinces that had benefited 87 per cent of their patients, including the Gansu province (63.7%), the Ningxia region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the Hubei province, which had benefited only 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, had the lowest healing rate (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and its collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western medicine (MO) only and combined treatment associated with MO and MTC.
It has appeared that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (low to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%); mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC remains to be specified through larger-scale and more centre-controlled tests.
It would also be interesting to characterise the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of MTC treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally deeply concerned about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of sadness, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact search and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COPID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt for the sick with regard to the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with COPID-19, to individuals identified as likely cases, to persons in contact with these populations, and to any other person in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and specific updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reserves and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-COV.
Attenuated live vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly people and in models of fatal prophylaxis and protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the SARS was extended 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, cases and sporadic homes of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using the inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, particulates related to the virus and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective for monitoring the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge because of the considerable time (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in the coronaviruses.
To the extent that this is a emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without sequencing.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to be able to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies carried out so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COPID-19 patients are as follows (Table 33):
Age: age was the main factor for the SRAS forecast, and this also seems to be the case for the COVID-19.
The COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% more than 50 years, according to a study conducted in 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), thus suggesting age as a predictive factor for patients with COPID-19.
Sex: SARS-COV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 vs 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COPID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SRAS.
It has been established that SARS-COV-2 may also be associated with positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COPID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are highly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the rate of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential predictive factor for disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity and the COVID-19 forecast was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be involved in establishing prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, including the heart and liver level, and are released in the case of tissue lesions.
Thus, they are traditionally heart or liver dysfunction markers.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of thoracic radiography and the temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in association with other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used to treat infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since the high dose of corticosteroids has been widely used for severe cases of SARS, many survivors have presented atrial osteonecrosis resulting in permanent inability and quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, administration of steroids to patients with COPID-19 should be limited to a low dose and to a short duration.
Mental Stress: As described above, the COPID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients who often have long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of loved ones or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of the SARS.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory pathways, SARS-COV-2 is also effectively replication in upper respiratory pathways and does not or does not exhibit any symptoms in the first phase of infection, such as coronavirus from the origin of common rheumatoid arthritis.
Therefore, newly infected or incubated individuals may produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-COV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with very low transmission probability in the first phase.
The current epidemic of COVID-19 is therefore much more severe and difficult to control than that of the SARS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the bordering of Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of the nearly totality of the population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases decline, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggested that the epidemic would end in March and that the decline phase would last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that the COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than the SARS, will not spread in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-COV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-COV-2 had been detected in the mid-nasal cornet and the gorge of restored patients, 2 weeks after their exit from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial estimates, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and one half million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-COV, that SARS-COV-2 weakens in terms of infection to eventually spread or evolve into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by the toes or estuaries, as well as possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in cells, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study in 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Caution should therefore be taken in order to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone who is likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and breathing masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or deposit them on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of viruses from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of fully penetrated viruses; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size, as both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can pass through five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor turned out to be infected with SARS-COV-2 while wearing a mask N95; the virus could have penetrated its body by ocular means due to inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also have transparent views or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For people in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to stay confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new human virus, its high degree of homology with SARS-COV, as reported on 7 January 2020, has to have placed China as a high alert after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention would reassure the population by claiming that the new virus was low, that it had limited interhuman transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a significant release, particularly at the time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missing.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn lessons and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) provide more evidence of sensitivity and responsiveness to the unusual clinical data than to expect formal reports of doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic rather than to try to reassure the population; and (4) provide more targeted and relevant exercises to sensitize the population on epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve regularly the response system of society.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of this report, it extended to China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and that the symptoms of COPID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the epidemic of COPID-19 is a pre-eminent impression.
However, there are notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality are also more important in older people.
The SRAS has a higher mortality than that of the COVID-19 (10.91 % versus 1.44 %).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while the SRAS was mostly transmitted by patients who were severely ill; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-COV-2 spread much faster and much broader than SARS-COV.
Regular RNA detection tests of SARS-COV-2 may prove negative for some patients with COPID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may be once again positive for the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spreading.
Despite the rapid progress of the COVID-19 research, a number of critical issues remain pending, including:
Where's the SARS-COV-2 coming from?
Although a 96% genetic homolog has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two type-type SARS coronaviruses from mice, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropteres.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, for example the mice, to the man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-COV-2 is related to ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly in the respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve on a genetic basis during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear as the SARS or regularly resurface as the flu?
It is essential, although this may take time, to find answers to all of these and to many others.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients had a severe respiratory infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
Without the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, the peak of the viral load on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-COV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress such as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false liver function tests and high kinase creatinine are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests in case of suspicion of SARS.
Spreaded alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SRAS.
Some 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory pathways, several organs including gastro-intestinal pathways, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytokinic shock, which can be fatal especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, considerable efforts have been made to research on HCV.
The HCV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly persons and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of this same virus from the birth of an 8-month-old male who has pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
The HCV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also called crop.
In the same year, HCV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of the SRAS are similar to those of the SRAS and are characterized by a evolutionary acute pneumonia.
Contrary to SARS, many patients suffering from SMR also developed acute renal failure, which is a characteristic of SMR compared to HCOV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported with a high rate of death, 34.4 per cent, which makes the MERS-COV one of the most known deadly viruses in man.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
The SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than the SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-COV-2 have been reported and could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCV revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HPV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-COV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCVs (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small sub-group of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as with SARS-COV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-COV-2 can be detected in seal samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and its long-lasting distribution after transmission to humans, will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCVs cause moderate symptoms have been well adapted to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HPV pandemics.
In order for this to happen, HCVs should be replicated in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
In this view, the more SARS-COV-2 epidemic persists and the more infected people are important, the more chances the virus adapts completely to man.
If appropriate, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control infections.
For many years, the four CoVs in the community have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple rhyme in the immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require animal reserves.
On the other hand, SARS-COV and MERS-COV, highly pathogens, have not adapted well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zootic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
The SARS-COV-2 has similar characteristics to the SARS-COV/MERS-COV and the four HCVs acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogen than HCV in the community and less pathogen than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among them without reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing animal origins of HCV, it will be useful for us to discuss definitions and characteristics of the evolving, natural, reservoirs, intermediate and amplifiers of HCV.
An animal serves as an evolving host of a HCV if it opens a nearby ascendant sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The virus of origin has often been well adapted and is not pathogen for its host.
Similarly, a reservation host opens the HCV continuously and in the long term.
On the other hand, HCVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reserve host.
In particular, since 80 % of the Guangzhou market animals have anti-SARS-COV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also be used as amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These mice are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the basis for a new concept that mice are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is known as the recipient of SARS-COV.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally not the immediate parent of SARS-COV and the mice are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-COV.
That's why mers-cov can't be the mers-cov intermediate tank host.
In addition to studies carried out in the Middle East, it has been shown that seropositive seropositive sero-positive sero-positive specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as well as the camels originating in the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels expel the virus not only by respiratory pathways, but also by faecal pathways, which is also the main route of excretion of mice.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangoline is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-COV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is even less important than that which separates beta-COVs associated with SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 from pangoline.
Recombination is a common factor in the development of beta-COVs.
Scientists remain divided into the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCVs, zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E could be derived from the coV of mice, whereas the parent viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, the HCV-229E was genetically associated with another cavities cov, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camels were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When the HCV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infecting humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of the inter-species transmission of HCV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the nearby HCV-229E key was found.
First of all, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with mice in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contacts with alpagas.
Then, the alpha-COV of the mice related to HCV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in mice, while the alpha-COV of the alpaga has caused a respiratory disease epidemic in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-COV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, mice are the direct source of human pathogen virus, including the virus of the rabies, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that mice can transmit HCV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-COVs of the mice serve as a genetic reserve of the HCV-229E, the alpha-COVs and Travellers could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting the viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-COV.
The MERS-COV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of mice to travelers and travelers to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in mice is known by its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been present in the travelers for decades.
It has been well adapted to these camels that have been passed from mid-guest to stable natural reservoir.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-COVs are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
Several inter-species transmission possibilities of SARS-COV-2 from animals to humans were included or excluded from future studies.
First, mice may be the host of a virus related to SARS-COV-2 almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with the mice through the decommissioning or coal mines.
Second, the pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 has been recently introduced.
Human beings contract the virus by decomposition and consumption of gibire meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-COV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place within a third species that has been in contact with both mice and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-COV-2 is under way.
Compared to other single-bred RNA viruses, the estimated rates of COV mutation could be considered as "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year per site, according to the phase of adaptation of COV to new hosts.
However, CoV mutation rates are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-COV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-COV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to man.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host near humans.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which has been well adapted to drivers.
In theory, the genetic derivative is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently change the model when replication of the RNA through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as for coV observed in animals such as SL-COV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors listed above, the viral interaction with a host receiver is another key factor affecting inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-COV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to man.
It is interesting to note that SARS-COV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
A 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 protein unit S means that the affinity of this S protein may have been altered with human ACE2.
In fact, a study by electronic chryomycopia indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times that of this binding compared to that observed between the human ACE2 and the S protein in the SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
Incidentally, HCV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E, and silica 9-O-acetylated for HCV-OC43.
The differentiation of host proteins between humans and natural HCOV reservoirs, such as mice, ruminants and rodents, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
New HCV emergency: return to home
The diversity of the coVs of the cavities provides many new HPV emerging opportunities.
In this sense, HCVs are genetic reserves of HCVs.
Among the SARS-CoV-accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as the SARS-CoV-related heat-tight viruses were isolated, but coded different ORF8 proteins.
This removal splits ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is present as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombinant sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
It has also been shown that the mers-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred among road users in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCOV-229E-associated mice and camels viruses, the alpha-COV of the alpaga presents a simple integration of nucleotide, resulting in a deceleration of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reserve hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when cavities were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and cavities.
It seemed that the mice were well adapted to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of mice could both suppress the replication of the CoV and affect the "reduction" by exoribonuclease, which would create a selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
CoV strains of more pathogens could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence if three new HCVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to book such as mice and camels.
They are solidly replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of the causes of severe cases of infection in humans reside here.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the more the immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, among asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the CoV replication.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of the SARS-COV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory mass NLRP3 is defective in mice.
Based on this reasoning, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammatory mass with the MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COPID-19.
While a beta-coV of cauliflowers sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a cauliflower coV sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
A strikingly similar pangoline beta-COV-2 has been found, indicating that pangoline may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangoline beta-COV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of the SARS-COV-2.
CoVs have been returned under ramp lights due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been in the passenger's home for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MRLs, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-COV in camels, associated with other control measures of the infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the coVs of cavities, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance of contagion.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonose reservoirs.
First, if the mice transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the circumstances in which the mice and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with mice.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Whether it's a sister-in-law, pangoline or other mammals, we should be able to identify the SARS-COV-2 or the near-idential parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhum, for example, by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Washing hands has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands in soap.
Pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, who are nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor delinquent effect, frequent hands wash can soften the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hands washing could lead to ekyma or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by skin spasms and discoloration, and especially frequent among health workers.
Hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
The dispersal twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is not an effective skin cleaner as lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficult to soluble in water.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of the antibacterial soaps, they could not be as effective as they were announced.
In addition to the antimicrobial agent and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's Public Health School indicated that regular soaps were as effective as the antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, wet and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils from salads and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of wet water did not contribute to reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or mouse for a greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as mushrooms.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contaminating gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to well grind or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace an adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by skin moisturizers and/or moisturizing agents.
The dry effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsifiers caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic substances present on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is slowed after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin reactions.
The ashes or the earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of braking them.
Like soap, ashes is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with cold or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to differ).
Move a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap eliminates germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frotter action creates friction, which helps to eliminate germs from the skin, and longer frotter removes more germs.
Get a lot of running water.
Cleaning in a stagnant water pool can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean or open tray.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recontaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, the wrist, the space between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
The artificial nails and the extended nail paint can accommodate micro-organisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when the tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, flushing water from a bidon or a hard suspended and lost hard and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tip-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross with a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels that are often found in the toilets.
After the washing and drying of hands in hot-water dry-eyes, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria was on average increased by 194 per cent on the thumb pulp and by 254 per cent on the thumbs.
Drying at dry-water wells resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the body of the fingers of 42 per cent and on the arms of 15 per cent.
Following the drying of hands, the following changes in bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different landfill manufacturers, and landfills have been compared to landfill using paper trays.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hand to move and rub.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing through the fingers.
After drying, the paper tray must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove the pathogen microorganisms (the germs) and to avoid transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms up to the waist, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When washing, the water on the front arms must be avoided.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
As regards the control of infections in staphylococcal hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained at the first 20% of the wash, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the hand washing rate above 35%.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands around private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hands wash rates may also be attributable to tight habits rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce childhood diseases and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural development.After the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetal smells called miasmas.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to the sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be involved in something.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after each meal.

It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genomes, which are very likely to result from the pressures exerted in the selection, including the host immune system.
For example, the loss of the full ORF4 can be cited in the HPOV-229E prototype strain because of a two-nucleotide deletion.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCOV-229E-associated mice and camels viruses, the alpha-COV of the alpaga presents a simple integration of nucleotide, resulting in a deceleration of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reserve hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when cavities were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and cavities.
It seemed that the mice were well adapted to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in mice is eliminated by positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of the molecules of the major class I compatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of mice could both suppress the replication of the CoV and affect the "reduction" by exoribonuclease, which would create a selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
CoV strains of more pathogens could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence if three new HCVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to book such as mice and camels.
They are solidly replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of the causes of severe cases of infection in humans reside here.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the more the immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, among asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the CoV replication.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in mice.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of the SARS-COV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory mass NLRP3 is defective in mice.
Based on this reasoning, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammatory mass with the MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COPID-19.
The SARS-COV-2 is shown in the general diagram by which SARS-COV and MERS-COV emerged.
While a beta-coV of cauliflowers sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a cauliflower coV sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present in the markets have been discovered as carriers of the same virus in SARS-COV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-COV-2 has been identified.
A strikingly similar pangoline beta-COV-2 has been found, indicating that pangoline may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangoline beta-COV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of the SARS-COV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-COV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs have been returned under ramp lights due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in mice and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reserves in the transmission of HPVs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 come from the mice and are transmitted to man by via hosts.
Since the infection in SARS-COV comes from contact between humans and civets present in the markets, the closure of the fresh products markets and the slaughter of the civets found there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the market for fresh products to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many lines of beta-COV of pangolins closely related to SARS-COV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolines and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the studies to be followed.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been in the passenger's home for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MRLs, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-COV in camels, associated with other control measures of the infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the coVs of cavities, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic coVs to evolve and recombinate, leading to the emergence of new coVs that are more transmissible and/or mortal to man in the future.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In the face of the ravages caused by the SARS, the MERS and the COVID-19, a better plan of preparation and intervention should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance of contagion.
Although mice have many features conducive to the spread of viruses, the probability for humans to be in contact with mice and other wild species can be minimized if people are sensitive to the need to stay away.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonose reservoirs.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are known yet.
First, if the mice transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the circumstances in which the mice and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with mice.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are capable of contracting SARS-COV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it's a sister-in-law, pangoline or other mammals, we should be able to identify the SARS-COV-2 or the near-idential parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will allow the development of SARS-CoV-2 in animals to be elucidated and will have significant implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCOV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and our knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this email, we have responded to a comment on our guidelines and we have provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COPID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially carries the name of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), and the virus was called severe coronavirus 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-COV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has brought much attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COPID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and our knowledge progress slowly on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the WHOID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) received seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially amended.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a proposal for a simple assessment based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve their important work and we thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COPID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives (test seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspect case should be associated with one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or should correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological backgrounds:
Epidemiological background: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighboring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or other areas prior to the occurrence of COVID-19; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or other communities prior to the occurrence of symptoms in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of a history of accidents with confirmed cases in the area and/discipation of accidents.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) images presenting the characteristics of an infection in COPID-19; (3) total number of white blood cells indicating normal, reduced or reduced number of lymphocytes from the beginning of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case shall be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) PCR test in real time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with new known coronavirus; (3) positive serological test for the IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody; or modification of the specific IgG antibody from the SARS-CoV-2 by negative to positive or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nuclear acids in respiratory pathways or blood transfusions was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic blood samples were added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nuclear acid detection kit for a rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory path samples including blood collection, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, increasing evidence reminds us of caution regarding atypical and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s graphic representation should be updated as they classified people who did not have clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to transmit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent directives in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in due time to offer its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country thus records a record of the mortality due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of infected persons registered included 114 active cases and 33 persons who remained confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closing of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods (medical, fuel and food supplies) was always permitted.
On 19 March, these three people were already restored.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exceeded the million in the world, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, extended the border of the city until 1 May.
The Portuguese Parliament voted on the extension of the state of national urgency of 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemics have reversed the trend to reveal the extent to which HPV infection could be devastating and potentially fatal.
Most HCVs come from mice that are not pathogens.
The host intermediate reserves of certain HCVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of coV-host interactions in animals could also improve the understanding of coV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified in four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The Beta-CoV genre contains the majority of HCVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that mice and rodents play a genetic source for the majority of alpha-COVs and beta-COVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-COVs and delta-COVs.
To date, seven human coVs (HCOV) are known.
These include HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-COVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
The tracing of the zoonotic origins of the HCOV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the motor forces and the restrictive factors of the crossing of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-COV-2 host(s), with significant implications for the prevention of future contagion.
Animal CoVs have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Over the last few decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCV-229E was isolated in the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and was then adapted to grow in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had symptoms of classical rhume, including headaches, swelling, nausea and throat, with fever and toxins observed in 10-20% of cases.
The HCV-229E and the HCV-OC43 are both present all over the world and seem to be broadcast mainly in winter, in countries with temperatured climate.
Stores in Australia reduce the amount of paper limited by purchase
Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian stores Woolworths and Coles have reduced their restrictions on the purchase of two toilet paper and a package per purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the cash registers and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
The buyers apparently added reservations to the fear of the COVID-19 and the need for restraint.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for domestic deliveries to a package per order.
These measures resulted from the previous restriction of four purchase packages introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release on 8 March, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock break at the time after delivery", and qualified the request for "unforeseen", while ALDI, in a Tuesday Facebook publication, described it as "an unexpected one".
Sales experienced a "high increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce poverty, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI earlier made stocks available for a planned promotion on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to respond to demand, and less promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early opening of stocks, some stores are unable to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the field of the distribution of the University of Technology, explained that stores are resupplying stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a voluminous article, resulting in stocks of a small quantity that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in the rays, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce the panic,” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said Wednesday they were in stock break.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbente paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first buyer at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer sales to auctions were organized because buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labour Festival.
The issue of Thursday's NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included a box of eight pages intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, in which they announced that they did not intend to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-wheel packages.
The World Health Organization qualifies as the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) qualified the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV-2) of pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of disease spread, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to push Governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries test, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations within the framework of the response," said Tedos Adhanom Ghebreyeus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned not only about the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "without precedent".
He stated, in a speech published by CNN in February, that "except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed from its appearance to its continued worldwide spread."
Gebreysus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "And we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said regarding the epidemic: "to reduce the situation will worsen."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a running coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe coronavirus 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared urgent international public health on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and swelling.
Complications may include acute respiratory distress pneumonia and syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may range between two and fourteen days.
There is no specific known vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to touch, staying away from other people, and monitoring and limiting people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing restrictions on movements, quarantines, firefights, risk controls on workplaces and closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances at the global level, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread poverty caused by panic purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information on the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and South-East Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there was a decrease in atmospheric pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an unknown cause pneumonia home on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the large market of the Huanan Sea fruit and therefore it is thought that the virus would be zoonotic.
The virus that caused the epidemic is the SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely linked to the coronaviruses of mice, the coronaviruses of pangolins, and the SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first known person presenting symptoms had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and this person had no clear link with the subsequent home of the free product market.
In the case of the first home reported in December 2019, the two thirds had to have a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be brought back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person from the Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, including those with benign symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, 19-year-olds and less represented 2.4% of cases in the world. The United Kingdom Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance believed that 60% of the British population had to be infected before being able to achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases indicate the number of persons tested at COPID-19, whose test has been positive according to official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those who had only blessed symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that up to 23 January China was estimated to have 86 per cent of the non-detected infections of COVID-19 and that these undetected infections were the source of 79 per cent of the documented infections.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than reported cases.
The first estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COPID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the time between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent experienced pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official accounts of deaths related to the pandemic of COPID-19 generally refer to deceased persons who have been tested positive for COPID according to official protocols.
The number of real victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, as it could not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the mortality rates during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of the COVID deaths.
A spokesperson of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has acknowledged "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotic reports of the underassessment in the United States. Such underestimation occurs often in pandemics, such as the swine flu epidemic H1N1 of 2009. The first confirmed death took place in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death out of continental China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death out of Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On February 28, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and, above all, health.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the global case-decease report is 6.0 per cent (97 039/11 617 204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region.
In China, the estimates for the case report decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that occurred between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that occurred after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the fatality rate (letality rates), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease and the rate of infection (infection rates), which represents the percentage of contaminants (diagnostics and non-diagnosed) that occur with a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of the disease-related contamination.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the infection rate for pandemic in its overall ranges from 0.1% to 0.39%.
The highest value of this sample is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on the estimates of the fatality rate.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, usually infectious epidemics stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease is missing from available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen.”
The Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said that "this could be done by June" if all countries were able to mobilize to follow the WHO recommendations on measures to eradicate the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-COV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two".
According to a study by the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is transmitted very easily—disappears completely" and that it could "be transformed into seasonal disease, which can be reappeared every year".
The virulence of this return depended on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COPID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific, and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, swelling, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) review emergency symptoms such as breathing difficulties, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and face or bluetongue; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory syndrome, septicemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, then the researchers have issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with infected people should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
The Chinese assessment of the asymptomatic ratio ranges from some 44% to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often than five days. A good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people who have lost the smell was initially 30 per cent before falling to 15 per cent.
Some information on how the disease spread remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during a close contact and for the purposes of drops produced by touching, tingling, or talking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have revealed that towing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted for long periods of longer periods of air, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory drops can also be projected at the end of the process, including speaking, although the virus is not usually airported.
Postilons can land in the mouth or nose of other people on the side or even inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (RCP) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore lead to air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted by the cells, this risk is considered to be weak.
The Government of China excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before symptoms occur and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for disease up to three days before symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during the contact search.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how the disease is spreading, one person usually contaminants two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Exactly, the virus was detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and at the end of four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces that infected persons might have touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three persons with pneumonia related to Wuhan’s acute respiratory disease home.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the related coronavirus in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis has shown that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, sub-gen Sarbecovirus (Lingage B) associated with two strains of the fungal.
It is equivalent to 96% of the total genome of another sample of coronavirus fungi (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the sequences of the genome between the pangolin virus and the human virus.
The comparison of the overall genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of the common genetic material between the pangoline coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangoline is the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however the final confirmation is carried out by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected or scanner secretions.
A study comparing the PCR and scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner is not used to depise or as a first-purpose test to diagnose the COVID-19".
WHO published several ARN test protocols for SARS-COV-2, with a first release on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on respiratory or blood extracts.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharynx extract, but a gorge extract can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved to be reliable enough to be approved for generalised use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Celex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristics of imagery on the radiographics and tomodensitometry (scan) of people with symptoms include asymmetric asymmetry glass opaques and a lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case-imaging results.
Because of cutting with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is a limited precision to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to PCR and demonstrated that if the image is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, recommending its inclusion as a detection tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutional neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in both imaging and radiographics.
The strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and touching or exterminating in a mosquito and throwing the mosquito directly into a bag.
Those who would have already been contaminated were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission; many governments have banned or advised all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals are advised to take care of someone who may be infected to take usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments in this regard raised issues of confidentiality, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communiqué calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been launched or proposed on the basis of the voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on solutions that were respected in private life, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, getting the nose off and chewing with the mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilets or when their hands are clearly salt; before eating; and after washing, having coughed, or melted.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant containing at least 60% of alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute exposure to the disinfectant for stainless steel surface), including ethanol to 62–71%, isopropanol to 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite to 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide to 0.5%, and povidone to 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment as an office building or a crash, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick people be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their tight neck or a bladder when they touch or exhale, and to throw away any bladder immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the posters that are projected by speaking, elevating, and tossing.
WHO issued instructions that explain where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Bringing a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hygiene." The use of masks has also been recommended for those who deal with a potential person affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face an important risk, for example if they are dealing with a COVID-19 patient, even though it recognized that the mask port can help people not touch the face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of throwable medical masks for healthy people, especially in the case of proximity (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other persons.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or connected places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make facial masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited release to the public without masks or other means of covering its nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone would protect himself and protect others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the mask port to coach and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made the port of a mask mandatory for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artificial mask to those who can't buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes control measures for infections to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and commercial centres.
Social distance methods can be applied while staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding the crowds, greeting themselves without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distance in the regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by the United States government and health agencies has been rapidly reduced by 250 (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 persons, and later to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were thus invited by the CDC to stay at home as far as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by preserving social links, whether virtually or by maintaining a distance.
The use of the term "social distance" meant that total social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They understand the recommendation to have sexual relations only with a person with whom we live, who does not have the virus or who does not have symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for individuals diagnosed positive for COPID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many Governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at risk groups.
Persons who have been exposed to a COVID-19 disease and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to sit in quarantine for 14 days from the time they were able to be exposed for the last time.
The control strategies of an epidemic are obesity or elimination, and mitigation.
The onset is established during the first phases of the epidemic and is intended to monitor and isolate the infected, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are shifting towards the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its impact on the health care system and society.
Equipment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures, in order to influence the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called the spread of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and makes time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masking and individual quarantine; public social distance measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to address the epidemic have been taken in China since the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and quarantine, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have been quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has sanctioned the emergence of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that the slowdown (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and the elimination (reversing the development of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand of 2/3 and death of half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The removal may be privileged, but it must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), because otherwise the transmission is rapidly rebounded when the measures are released.
The long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking drugs without order against rhum or drinking and rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids may exacerbate results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COPID-19.
WHO said that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" could suppress the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COPID-19 is described by WHO as a key response to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for the care of primary health care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to the COVID-19 tests, by canceling non- urgent interventions when possible, by separating and insulating patients tested positive for COVID-19, and by strengthening intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are several theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could be recovered as of 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronary viruses in the Hubei has increased gradually.
They are generally linked to the big sea fruit market in Huaan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Hospital, which informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were recommended by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was recommended by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There was enough of an unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation early in January. During the first phases of the epidemic, the number of cases was approximately seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by the Chinese New Year's migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport pool as well as a major railway correspondence site.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by showing the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 healed.
Some 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the European pandemic, many Schengen countries have restricted their movements and established border controls.
National responses include emergency measures such as quarantine (also called home, shelter or bordering orders) and cover. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, are subject to a form of bordering in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, approximately 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world were familiar with a form of bordering, with a figure rising to 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would return on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home of cases of unidentified pneumonia on 26 December, which she informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
The initial genetic tests of patients on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SRAS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning to have "probably spread rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping as a "war of the people" to end the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop the journeys from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of New Chinese An (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.

The schedules of air companies were also affected and therefore amended. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population for the virus, and isolate all infected people and monitor and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
The detection methods included the mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through a mobile application, the virus detection drives issuing the results the following day, and an increased test capacity to allow the test of nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in the control of the epidemic, although it did not put the whole city in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided on the response of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.

A report from CNN indicated that the combination between the important elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all persons affected by the virus to date could have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus was first seen as one of the most flexible of the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distance or measure of quarantine to its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of responsiveness and responsiveness in response to public concerns.

Despite this, the United States has taken time to start testing, which has hidden the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were carried out by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval of the federal government for non-governmental screening kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February and restrictive criteria to be able to claim a test until the beginning of March (order of a doctor required subsequently).

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that even though it was "not of course a recommendation by WHO", it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is the most concentrated" and spoke of a "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, following the confirmation of an inter-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic constituted an urgent public health issue of international coverage (USPI), the sixth USPI since the adoption of the 2009 outbreak of influenza.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that the USPI was due to "the risk of global proliferation, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said: "There is no reason for measures to interfere in vain with international trade travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute up to $675 million to fund strategic preparation in low-income countries, calling for the urgent support of those countries that "do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was at the point of appearing".
Tedros then stated that we were "as strong as our lowest post" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay tomorrow". On 11 February, WHO established a press conference called COVID-19.

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, said in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you must be ready," adding that good response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan then stated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, namely that such a statement would mean that "we accept in absolute that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, WHO stated that the kronavirus epidemic could be classified as pandemic.
The Director-General noted that WHO was "extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of propagation and severity and the alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced significant criticisms about its management of the pandemic, considered inadequate, particularly due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as pandemic.
This negative response was supported by a petition encouraging WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.

Several provincial Chinese Communist Party (PCC) administrators have been identified from their functions following their quarantine management in Central China, a sign of discontent regarding the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger in relation to the coronavirus epidemic.
Some high-level Chinese leaders, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronavirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that the COVID-19 would hold its origins in the United States or in Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump qualified the coronavirus of "Chinese virus" or " Wuhan virus", stating that in China "censorship has now become a global pandemic", which was then taxed by some opponents and intended to "turn away the attention of his administration's inability to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast provided a telegram from the U.S. government explaining the main lines of a communication strategy apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is quoted as follows: "Everything comes from China.

The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with almost twenty members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen other former or current political personalities.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for assistance on 14 March 2020, stating that his country had a problem fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic raised calls for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal child care program, paid parental leave and higher public health funding levels.
Political analysts expect that this negatively affects Donald Trump's election chances during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticised Japan's `embraceful and passive efforts' after it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks on government-designated sites.
South Korean society was at the beginning divided on the response to the crisis of President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's accusation of ill-management of the government's epidemic or, on the other hand, claiming its response. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt an emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to authorize Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until new order, to suspend parliament and elections, and to punish anyone who would have been accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's management of the crisis.
The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruption, resulting in a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and interruption of the operation of plants and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings on drug shortages and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of primary necessities products, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, and poverty.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned about delays in the delivery of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for individual protection equipment was multiplied by 100.
This application led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in delays in supplying medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This also led to a shortage of individual protection equipment worldwide and WHO warned that this would put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Daigos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the strong prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the strong demand for food that followed, both areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal stockpiling and trafficking of essential products have been a real success, avoiding the serious food shortages that have been planned in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its important agricultural production, Northern Italy has not found a significant decrease, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays were empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government opened pig reserves to ensure adequate livelihood of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.

The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with New Chinese An.
A number of events involving important crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's annual festivals, and private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions independently, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Moon Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass meetings, including Beijing's Forbidden City and the forums of the traditional temple.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended New Year's holidays until 10 February, imposing on most of the workplaces not to be reopened before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of GDP in the country and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has gone to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year's celebrations. The distribution sector has been impacted worldwide, with reduced opening hours for shops or temporary closures.
Business visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a decrease of between 50 and 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a drop of 33% to 43% of pedestrian traffic in malls in March compared to February.
Operators of commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America in relation to a situation without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of some 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves trapped in domestic or settled provinces in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The Coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Indian border has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) to unemployment. The Angus Reid Institute survey noted that 44 per cent of Canadian households have experienced some kind of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their employment in Spain since the border imposed in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies have made their employees go to a part-time activity facility subsidized by the government called Kurzlab.
The German part-time compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent, worldwide.
The arts and cultural organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, all over the world, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions were closed to new order and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or reported.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The cinema industry also experienced a break. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place last week in the period of Christian imprisonment of the Carème, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday’s lunches; some churches spread their religious services to the radio, online and live or television while others offer to practice their worship in "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and its chapels and St. Peter's Square, which was evicted from all its Christian pilgrims, other religious authorities have also canceled their services and limited public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gardwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Médine.
The pandemic has led to the most important interruption of the world's sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 League of Champions, the English Football Championship 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the LNH 2019-20 season.
The epidemic disrupted the organisation of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was due to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021". The casinos and other world-wide gaming institutions closed and live poker tournaments were postponed.
This has prompted many players to sign up online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new enrolments. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concerts.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway ones, have also interrupted all their representations.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in exchange for traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online "festivals" created to make artists happen, spread and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet feeds on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many enjoy humor and entertainment in the face of uncertainty.
Since the epidemic of COVID-19, a rise in prejudice, xenophobia and racism has been seen against people of Chinese and Asian origin and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hospitality have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Pacific region.
Reports of February (although most cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received justifiable punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei people reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
As a result of the progression of the epidemic towards sensitive new countries, Italians from the first European country to a severe epidemic of COVID-19 could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have at first signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their countries in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has raged on Twitter.
The Chinese and the other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in the level of racist insults, as well as aggression.
US President Donald Trump has addressed the criticism of having qualified the coronavirus of "Chinese virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked Ukrainian buses and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the Coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the Bengal-West unity of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took his revenge on them".
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants have been exposed by the pandemic, while foreigners are described as "foreign waste" which should be "cleared".
Many payroll newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory screening of the respiratory disease with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods of detection of the virus and detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus DNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 DNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported mortality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngitis or the sample of the specimen.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharyngitis is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in deep respiratory pathways by aspiration catheter, or a cockpit (expectation) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 with the help of an inverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), and constituted the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the authorization of the Chinese National Medical Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic device by RT-PCR in real time from the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the former versions of the test kits, a genetic test of three obtained non-conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a testing shell at the Atlantic CDC. Thus, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it is only until federal and local laboratories have been authorized to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation.The US commercial laboratories began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics has also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and treatment of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Research in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at COPID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA's authorization for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorisation (U.S.) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepidheid also received an FDA US for a test taking about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the isothermal amplifying technology of nuclear acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify the manufacture to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the protein of the new coronavirus (N protein) is under development in Taiwan, hoping that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid flu test.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary radiographics have a low diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodendensitometry] may be finalized even before symptoms occur."
Among the typical symptoms visible on the TDM are multi-laborary bilateral glass opaques with a peripheral, asymmetrical and lateral distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and a consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing the PCR to the TDM in Wuhan, at the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that the TDM is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, several of its image results coincident with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that "TDM is not used for testing or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19."In March 2020, CDC recommends PCR for initial testing.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms occur, to determine immunity and within the framework of population surveillance.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by testing the patient's hair (point-of-care testing, PACT).
High-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
For POT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction step is required prior to the analysis.On 26 March 2020, the FDA has appointed 29 entities that have informed the agency properly and can therefore now distribute their antibody testing tests.
At 7 April 2020, one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The detection capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the PCR test of the viral DNA.
The antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the beginning of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that no test kits for antibodies purchased by the country were sufficient to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which cases of suspicion may remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients scream inside, return it and receive the result of the test later.The British NHS has announced that it is carrying out a pilot project to test cases of suspect at home, thus eliminating the risk that a patient will not infect others by entering a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the COVID-19 test for the suspect, a health professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres have enabled South Korea to conduct one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Disease Insurance Doctors stated on 2 March that it had the ability to conduct some 12,000 tests per day in the ambulatory environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by sickness insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, drive tests were available in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at 12/20 calendar week, a total of at least 483 295 samples were tested until 12/20 and that 33 491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-COV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technology and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at the same time, bringing together samples and testing only if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory for emergency detection of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: ↔, that is "fired" in French and does not result in testing.
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei Province would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this testing capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly monitored by Hua-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities as a whole.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity rose to 50,000 tests per day.Furthermore models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,22 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without a liquid-manipulating robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reactive have become an obstacle to mass testing in the EU, the UK and the United States.
This situation has led some authors to consider sampling protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes in order to continue testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now testing most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to run drive tests and purchase a high-speed laboratory at the population level with Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulations targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for producing low-income kits that do not have the necessary resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the Centres for Disease Control of the United States was only published on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to respond to the demand and recommendations for testing by health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
The research capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of testing programmes as a better way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The strong demand for virus-wide testing resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests delayed in the private laboratories of the United States, and reserves of shellfish and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported issues related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDCs were "failures". The government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that were hampering private tests.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be linked to the inability to collect samples or to properly use kits.
The Spanish Department stated that it would remove the kits that had produced wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits purchased to China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Ministry of Turkish Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased to China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits to China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were useless.
The screening, followed by forty of those who achieved a positive result and the tracking of the people who had been in contact with the carriers of SARS-COV-2, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place of the first death associated with COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the total population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Nearly half of those who had a positive outcome had no symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.
With the restriction of movements in the municipality, this measure completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of retail restaurants and establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at their home on 28 March, but schools returned at the date scheduled for the end of the holiday on 23 March.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic with an aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive borders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that have conducted the most tests compared to the number of deaths have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people with only minor symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and 10 negative samples of COVID-19 to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories to carry out confirmatory tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positivity in % of tests" column depends on national testing policy.
A country that does not test that persons admitted to hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors are the same.
The washing of hands, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to the cleaning of hands to remove salads, fats, micro-organisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal pathways.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhum, for example, by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defiling, after cleaning a baby's cheeks or changing her thighs, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
If you do not have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands in the ass. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
After changing the layers of a baby or cleaning up a child who has gone to the toilet;
after being wet or wet/hallowed;
after touching an animal, animal food or animal waste;
The hygiene of the hands in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Washing hands has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate at home.
According to a study conducted in 2013, improvements in hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands in soap.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The introduction of measures to promote hand washing could reduce the diarrhoea episodes by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands in soap allows for 48% reduction of diarrhoea episodes and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRA). It is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, who are nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the deaths due to diarrhoea and a quarter of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally associated with other health measures under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor delinquent effect, frequent hands wash can soften the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hands washing could lead to ekyma or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by skin spasms and discoloration, and especially frequent among health workers.
Hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (mitition, defecation), after cleaning a baby's feces (or changing her layers), before feeding a child, before and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
It is also appropriate to wash your hands properly in order to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after having healed a wound or cut, after it has been extinguished, touched or wet, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching orders.
In many countries, the cleaning rate of soap hands is low.
According to a 2015 study with 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that it was in Saudi Arabia the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China was the lowest (23%). Today, there are several methods for changing the behaviour and democratizing the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. In particular, in developing countries, it is possible to propose that schools wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day.
For example, the Department of Education of the Philippines implemented a " Primary Health Care Program" to promote the health and education of children.
The dispersal twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soap or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is not an effective skin cleaner as lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficult to soluble in water.
An adequate flow of water, however, facilitates cleaning.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer was unlikely because bacteria are broken with the mouse.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that "automatic liquid soap distributors are preferred".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to those concerned with their health status.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which are resistant to many kinds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of the antibacterial soaps, they could not be as effective as they were announced.
In addition to the antimicrobial agent and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's Public Health School indicated that regular soaps were as effective as the antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, wet and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils from salads and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of wet water did not contribute to reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and early in the twenty-first century, non-aqueous hand hygiene products (correspondingly called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hand disinfectants) began to be popularized.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or mouse for a greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as mushrooms.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% of alcohol eliminate 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5 log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (a reduction of 4-5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contaminating gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to well grind or cover both hands.
The thumb and the back of both hands and the interstices between fingers and nails should be crossed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, mousse or gel is dry.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when hands are clearly salty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace an adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by skin moisturizers and/or moisturizing agents.
The dry effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsifiers caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions have less tendency to provoke annoying contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands in water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic substances present on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is slowed after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use ash or soil instead.
The ashes or the earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of braking them.
Like soap, ashes is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the hands be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, as follows:
Wet your hands with cold or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to differ).
Move a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap eliminates germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frotter action creates friction, which helps to eliminate germs from the skin, and longer frotter removes more germs.
Get a lot of running water.
Cleaning in a stagnant water pool can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean or open tray.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recontaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, the wrist, the space between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
The artificial nails and the extended nail paint can accommodate micro-organisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when the tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, flushing water from a bidon or a hard suspended and lost hard and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tip-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross with a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels that are often found in the toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-to-air dryers and more modern air-to-air dryers.
After the washing and drying of hands in hot-water dry-eyes, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria was on average increased by 194 per cent on the thumb pulp and by 254 per cent on the thumbs.
Drying at dry-water wells resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the body of the fingers of 42 per cent and on the arms of 15 per cent.
After washing and drying hands with a paper tray, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on average on the thumb and up to 77% on the thumbs.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a cross-contamination potential with other users of the toilets and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-tight drying system, which breathes from the outside of the apparatus at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling the microorganisms of the hands and the device and possibly contaminating other users of the toilets as well as the environment of the toilets in a perimeter up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air dryer allows the spread of micro-organisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the dry-water basin.
Paper trays revealed that there was no significant spread of micro-organisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt evaluated various methods of hand drying.
Following the drying of hands, the following changes in bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different landfill manufacturers, and landfills have been compared to landfill using paper trays.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The washing of hands in the medical environment became mandatory well after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study revealed that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hand to move and rub.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing through the fingers.
In case of leftovers under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
As germs present in water are likely to stay on their hands, it is important to get well and dry with a clean tray.
After drying, the paper tray must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents your hands from retancing into surface contact.
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove the pathogen microorganisms (the germs) and to avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hands cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and nurses who forget to wash their hands regularly before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and rub hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade may measure and certify the hygiene of the hands, if compliance with the regulations is done.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" concerning hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (also known as "medicines" or "antimicrobials") provides the hand washing agent with an action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to eliminate these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotics-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "frotter" the hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a chlorohexidine or iodine wash product, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing them, a sterile brush to fry and another sterile tool to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms up to the waist, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When washing, the water on the front arms must be avoided.
Once the hands are washed, the hands should be dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical jacket inserted.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
As regards the control of infections in staphylococcal hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained at the first 20% of the wash, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the hand washing rate above 35%.
If the washing of hands is compared to an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted to the food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing the cleaning of hands with an alcohol-based solution and the washing of hands with an antibacterial soap for an average period of 30 seconds each, the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium’s hard-to-hand spores. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care facilities, it is possible, among other things, to train hand-washing personnel, to make more alcohol-based products available to them and to address them with written and oral reminders.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap hand washing is considered to be a costly and essential tool to preserve health, or to eat properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands around private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hands wash rates may also be attributable to tight habits rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting the washing of hands in soap and conducting awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, reveal the benefits of this practice and lead to a long-term change in behaviour in the population.
In order to achieve this approach, monitoring and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. Regarding the promotion of hand washing in schools, the example of UNICEF's "Approximately Three Stars" can be cited, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce childhood diseases and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural development.After the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness report of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of healthy years (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just been hospitalized or injured soldiers, was identified for the first time in the middle of the 19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing care" British.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetal smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries of the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to the sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be involved in something.
It is derived from a Bible verse of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth undertakes to wash his hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary spot, symbol of his wrong conscience in view of the crimes she has committed and that she has encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering that they have committed acts contrary to ethics or have planned to do so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and give more value to hand washing devices.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the rituals of washing hands put forward in many religions, including Bahaism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual discharge of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the washing of the washed in Christianity and the wadhu in Islam. The religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilets.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Risk control of COVID-19 on the workplace
Risk controls of COVID-19 on the workplace indicate the implementation of health and safety methodologies at work for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary according to the place of work and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to a COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Employment Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest risk of exposure jobs have a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, the encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory label, maintenance of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-exposure jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons with no COVID-19 suspected or known but may be infected due to a current Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some large-scale retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to the basic prevention measures for infection, include high-efficiency air filter ventilation, hygienic glass and the provision of individual protection equipment in case of encounter with a person affected by COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a COVID-19 suspected or known as having a high risk of exposure, going to a very high risk if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or manipulate samples of persons with a COVID-19 suspected or known.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics may have several effects on the place of work.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen sick, have to take care of other people or fear a possible exposure.
Commercial models can change, both as regards the goods requested and the means to acquire them (especially to run out of time or to use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan for the preparation and response of infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, family and community context risk factors and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also ignore the controls necessary to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise following epidemics.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include the reduction of transmission among staff, the protection of people at higher risk of medical complications, the maintenance of commercial operations and the reduction of undesirable effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The Hierarchy of Risk Controls provides a comprehensive framework for health and safety at work in order to group effective risk controls.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and at the end of individual protective equipment.
Technical checks involve the isolation of employees from the risks associated with work without having to rely on the behaviour of workers, which can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls indicate changes in policies or procedures at work that require action on the part of the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPI must be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g., breathing masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced according to the needs, and correctly removed, cleaned and stored or reclaimed to avoid any contamination.
According to the U.S. Employment Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest risk of exposure jobs have a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures to prevent the infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and minute washing of hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing label, including covering their mouth and nose to touch and extend, providing mosquitoes and garbage, preparing for teleworking or working hours as needed, deterring workers from using other tools and equipment and maintaining the cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infected persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they have any more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrills or other medications acting on the symptoms. They also recommend applying flexible disease leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and to inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-exposure jobs include those who require frequent or close contact, at least six feet (1.8 m), of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known but who may be infected by COVID-2 due to a Community transmission under way around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international journey in a region with a widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes working in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail environments. The technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, the setting up of hours of ventilation, the installation of scheduled work barriers such as the installation of toilet windows in transparent plastic and the installation of a driving window for the client service. The administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of meetings in person by virtual communications, the setting up of hours of hours of work, the setting up of hours of hours of hours of hours of work of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours and hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours and years of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours and of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours and of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of years of years of hours of hours of hours of years and of years-night-night-night-night-night-night for years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years and of years of years of years of years and of years of years of years of years of years of years of years and of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years and of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years and of years of years of years and of years of years of years and of years and of years and of years of years and of years and of years and of years-----ableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableableable for years years years years years years years years years years years years years years years and of years years years and of years and of years years and of years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years for years and years of years of years of years for years for years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years of years for years
Workers in this risk group rarely need breathing masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the other's sick by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to take care of the sick and offering a mask of protection to the sick or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with the help of mosquitoes when he wears or wears.
The cabin crew shall wear removable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protective equipment if the sick passenger is suffering from fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the risk controls include the travel of the disease and the self-insulation and immediate information of the medical centre if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, a medical follow-up must take place in the person's cabin. For schools and child care, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has entered a school building, regardless of the community's spread.
In the case of a moderate minimum community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outputs, assemblies and other important meetings such as physical education or choir or canteen meals, by increasing the space between offices, by completing the hours of arrival and departure, by reducing non-essential visitors and by using a separate nursing home for children with flu symptoms.
In case of major transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered. For the order forces carrying out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDCs.
Officers of the Command Force who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of adequate individual protection equipment.
In the case of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts before re-use by means of a spoon or spray to clean the house and follow the standard procedures for confining and getting the EPIs used as well as for confining and washing clothes.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to belong to high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become highly exposed workers if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or pick-up or handling of samples of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol procedures include incubation, induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they pass to a very high risk of exposure if they practice an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including in conducting aerosol-producing procedures.
A specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain sanitary and funeral environments.
Samples should be manipulated using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients enter separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons working at least 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-COV-2 infection and for those conducting aerosol procedures.
In the United States, breathing masks N95 approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a full and written respiratory protection programme including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of breathing masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COPID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
WHO does not recommend the port of a surgical mask but by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect breathing samples, take care of or carry COPID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the case of aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of EPI is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI by means of telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a COPID-19 to people directly involved in its care, the use of the necessary EPI to the specific task alone, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the EPI supply chain and the determination of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJET: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare the future
EXPIRY DATE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No reserved right
We find ourselves in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human connection and the responsibilities we have toward one another.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and well-being we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud of all of you being among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me of his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at present, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, which you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make adjustments in the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our time jobs
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we have considered what we think would be a response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
We had first of all to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
To all staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
Our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week, up to a new order.
We will not report holidays: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the present time, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, run a race or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say so.
No illness or paid leave is required: just prevent your superior and help your team to review time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you have been positively diagnosed with COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from department T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C helps you and ensures that your situation receives the necessary attention from the management).
The hourly staff will be paid in full.
We have already announced it, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and our fellow members of the hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal conditions.
It's worth it if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to escape their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly gratifying, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and can take the necessary measures.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE teams, Ops HR, Security & Amp; Funding Collection (including) carry out an essential work that may need strengthening.
We will initiate a process with all departments in order to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks of our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most necessary projects.
Slowing down now won't do any worse later.
We do not intend to "work twice more to catch up with the lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to take extra hours to meet the deadlines now unrealistic.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new objectives and timetables if necessary.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the objectives of daily working time, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to set up a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of time limits significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and the teams of the next steps after confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by excessive caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution of hospital quality to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and lift boxes leading to our floor.
The building has used its own protocol of duty of diligence which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which shared with us and all Washington DC staff members its COPID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with the advice of San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be updated.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to remote work realize that adaptation can be difficult and wish to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider sharing them over several days.
Define clearly the meeting, have a agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the norm, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and direct exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being reimbursement for the collisions.
Join the #remote channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinaires to support increased work distribution in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel the public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the editions, until the end of the pandemic was announced by the WHO.
We explained to them that we understood that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional directives on Wikimania and other Community thematic and regional conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness over the confusion and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As a result, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special meeting of the staff next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff members living in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about movements, events, important workflows or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for whatever else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support and secure the connection if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Juden, Director of International Global Operations HR.
None of these changes should be regarded as abandoning our work and our obligations.
It is the opposite of recognizing that, at present, our work and our obligations are likely to have to be adapted in an unprecedented way.
These steps are those we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the service that everyone can rely on.
Our planned work will be here to wait for the time to come.
For now, it is time to get together and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need each one of you to get there, so you have to keep and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself at the time.
Finally, please: wash your hands and do not touch your face!

The ACE2 against angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The ACE2 is also the entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often named HACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of peptide at terminator N and a collection domain of the renal amino acid carrier at terminator C.
ACE2 is a single type I membrane membrane, the active enzyme field of which is exposed to the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is glued from the transmemoral domain by another enzyme called seddase; the resulting soluble protein is released in the blood stream and finally excreted in the urine.
The ACE2 is present in most organs: the ACE2 is primarily related to the cell membrane of Type II pulmonary alveolars, the enterocytes of the grey intestine, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 RNA is also present in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the brain trunk.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
The ACE inhibits the hormone angiotensin I in angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
The ACE2 in turn binds the amino phenylamine amino acid to angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Hes-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis into vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Hes-Pro-OH).
The ACE2 can also block several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greline.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral SLC6A19 amino carrier and is involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembrane protein, the ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus from SARS) ; and SARS-COV-2 (the virus from the COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 mirror to the enzyme field of the ACE2 to the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and in the transfer to both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the storage of protein S by host serum protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the protein is currently the subject of research as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help to fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continued standard treatment with ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and a meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to witnesses".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with AVC and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is present as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the porcelains with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes beyond the (long) 24 hour duration.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (SRAs) or for patients with high angiotensin II circulation. RhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracking of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 pandemic, i.e. the identification of people (“contacts”) likely to be in contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed to design contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the geographical location of application users, raise issues about privacy.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that enables citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have been exposed to COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, as far as it is concerned, chosen for an application called TraceTogether.
developed by a local IT community, it was provided in an open source and will be returned to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that ensures the tracking of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicates with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the tracking of contacts was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed over the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geoperage application for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and living in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, referred to several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and potential lack of effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of malicious or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only authorizes "official" or generally trusted organizations to add applications related to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Some private life protection activists have expressed their concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass monitoring, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have laid down eight conditions for compliance with government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
control and surveillance extensions should include extinction clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrated;
digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the Act;
protection against abuse and appeals for citizens in the event of abuse should be provided;
The "significant participation" of all "interested stakeholders" would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporting Without Borders) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, the network tracking was approved.
Network solutions with access to gross geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for communication, which enables privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system has collected tracking information from various sources, including data on the tracking of mobile devices and on card transactions, which have then been associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the Government also provided information on localization available to the public, which was permitted as a result of the profound changes in the privacy laws of the information after the MERS epidemic that affected the country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered using centralized systems that preserve privacy.
Details have not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well established concept, supported by a large volume of research data from 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on solutions to privacy, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol.The decentralised protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, previously appointed Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all matching settings are carried out on the device.
The Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques in the collection and use of location or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The Enigma MPC SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies initially based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a essentially equivalent common approach and protocols to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a wide audience.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, who control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy and a cryptography to ensure confidentiality.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that respect privacy
direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of adopting the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system by updating the operating system and then removing it in the same way once the remote threat.
The replacement of a medicine (also called reorientation, reprofiling, re-treatment or change in the therapeutic indication of a medicine) means the conversion of an approved medicine for a disease or for a different medical condition than that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-COV-2 has about 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites offers the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against COPID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the papaine type protein, the NRA polymerase dependent RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidates who then optimised and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most approved medications to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-COV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four medicines studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would start on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorisation (U.S.).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised by the US only as experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dose or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have indicated that you should use this medicine “when there is no other option”.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in association with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Higher studies are being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts a safety and efficacy test for the prevention of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and half amifenevir.
The Italian drug agency reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the drug is minor and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine in Japan for its reservations and that it would use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to care for patients with COPID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened opportunities for Trump to buy the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to reproduce.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These medicines have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would be associated with the SARS-COV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for drug replacement especially developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that remdesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several filviruses, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause a more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trial suggested that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by Cleveland university hospitals; one on people suffering from moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C intravenously for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill of COPID-19; two placebo-controlled tests (China and Canada) and one with no control (Italy).
The State of New York began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides a clinical trial on Teijin alvesco (cyclesonide), a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
An angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a phase II test in progress with 200 patients to recruit from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COPID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 years and over who have been diagnosed positive for COPID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian drug agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic drugs was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-COV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as the MERS, the SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COPID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenevir: umifenevir was recommended for the treatment of COPID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially reposable as COPID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many developmental attempts are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-COV-2, a disease-induced virus, at least 18 months earlier.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic has been reported throughout the world in 2020, generating major investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genomics published to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are the speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEP scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms were carrying out research and development projects early in 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the main platform in Phase I safety studies include:
Nuclear acid (ADN and RNA) (Developer phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, Type Adenovative Vector 5)
As reported by CEP scientists in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are at the first stages of development, 78 (79 according to the Milk Institute) confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed in planning or design).
A Phase I-II test carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres at all, determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a witness group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Among the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human person assessment phase (research “preclinical”).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pen vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that a vaccine should be started in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that he had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with his partner in biotechnology, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergency BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neo-antigen vaccination used for cancer treatment on 8 February 2020.

On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and even in accelerated procedures, it would take about one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, indicated to develop a particle similar to coronavirus through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is in the process of laboratory research and human tests are scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a great amount of money to gain exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19", which led to the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a NRA vaccine.
The vaccine candidate based on RNAm BNT162 is currently in the preclinical phase with the start of the clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the man of his final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Innovation (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium for the search for a vaccine against COVID-19, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing animals from six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an auto-amplifier RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the sequence being sent by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Nearly the same time, the Canadian government announced an allocation of $192 million to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 with projects to create a national "bank of vaccines" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University Medical School indicated that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, said that "subunits of SARS-COV-2 S1 vaccines administered by micro-hauls resulted in an important response from the specific antibodies of the antigen [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the School of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate into human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities shared their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines in the course of development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate the need to implement Level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protection vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and its effectiveness in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven Vaccine against MERS.
When the MERS spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS could be used as a model for developing vaccines and medicines against a MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one single disease vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three other vaccines were currently underway; all vaccines were on a viral vector, two on an adnovative vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one on an MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have published a conspiracy theory that the virus was known from the origin of COVID-19 and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various publications of social networks refer to existing patents dealing with genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the coronavirus of the SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and swelling.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may range between two and fourteen days.
While most cases produce moderate symptoms, some turn to viral pneumonia and failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus is mainly spread in close contact, often by drops produced by touching, tingling or talking.
These droplets are produced at the end, usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than present an infectious risk over long distances.
People may also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although the infection is possible before symptoms appear and during subsequent stages of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected by the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations for wearing masks by the public generally vary, some authorities recommending their use, others recommending their use, and others imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of WHO's six countries.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, swelling.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms it is recommended to consult a doctor immediately.
Uncommonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as elevation, nasal discharge or throat disorder may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only a thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease may cause pneumonia, the failure of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can go up to 14 days.
97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people with no symptoms is currently unknown and studied. Korean Disease Prevention and Control Centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectation and saliva can both carry important viral loads.
Speaking louder frees more goutettes than talking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that towing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors located in the corridor outside the patient's rooms produced positive samples of viral DNA.
Some medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary induction and resuscitation (RCP) can spread respiratory secretions and therefore cause air spread.
Although there are concerns about seed propagation, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how the disease is spreading, one person usually contaminants two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Exactly, the virus was detected at the end of one day on cardboard, at three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on copper at 99%.
This varies, however, depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if properly used; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which disables and eliminates skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
The coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three individuals with pneumonia related to Wuhan’s acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronavirus in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-COV-2 is a close relative of the SARS-COV of origin.
The lungs are the most affected organs of the COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) that is the most abundant in the type II alvéolary cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spice" (peplomer) to connect to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac lesions have been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with infections with COVID-19 and may be associated with unfavorable prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for epithelial cells of respiratory pathways that express ACE-2, severe COPID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
These are specifically GM-CSF secretive T cells that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting the IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COPID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported to autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngitis; however, a nasal or expectoration extract may also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours, up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks of interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain from the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently of chain polymerisation tests (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibodies tests (which may detect active infections and a person’s previous infection) were under development but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed a precision of only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test as close as possible to the patient on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Guidelines for diagnostics published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Opaques in multi-labor bilateral glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Pleural domination, crazy paving (interlobular septal spread with variable alveolar fold) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on COPID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, atypical atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudations.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
ongoing healing pneumonia: organization of exams in alveolar cavitys and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Sang: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding bonded places, often washing your hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a mosquito when we touch or feel and use the inside of the thigh in the absence of the mosquito.
A proper hand hygiene after touching or exterminating is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered by a fabric in public places, in order to limit the transmission of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing displacements and canceling important groups of people.
The distance directives also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known drug to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "placing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilets or when their hands are clearly salt; before eating; and after washing, having coughed, or ecstatic.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for trade hands are not available, WHO proposes two formulae for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
The hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not "an active antiseptic substance for the hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and the support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being vectors of the virus wear a simple facial mask.
The extracorporeal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene, a lifestyle and a healthy diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have moderate symptoms at the early stages of the infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COPID-19.
Rehabilitating and pneumologist doctors in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment of COVID-19.
As regards symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions must be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care when the procedures can generate aerosols, such as induction or manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COPID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in a room of isolation suitable for air infection (AIIR) as well as using standard precautions, contact precautions and air-transmission precautions. The CDC stresses the guidelines for the use of individual protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, breathing masks (in facial masks) are privileged.
The N95 breathing masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorisation (U.S.).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial protection screens, or last resort, of hand masks.
Most COPID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage is.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with respiratory failure associated with COPID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-flow nasal tube or positive pressure of double-level respiratory pathways.
It is ignored whether one or both of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to maintain invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal channel. Serious cases are more common in adults (those over 60 years of age, and in particular those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden number of cases of COPID-19 sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COPID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COPID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and a high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen release and minimize the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
The high PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments starting in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs is the subject of clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medications may not be developed before 2021, several existing drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to plasma of convalescents as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
He was not subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate his safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using monitoring data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend auto-quantain, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of massive data from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected persons and persons with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at ensuring respect for quarantine and protecting those who might have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate data of telephone location with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect non-quarantine people.
In Italy, the Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile telephone operators that "40 per cent of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global appeal to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, secondary effects of treatment or the fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may develop moderately with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
Moderate cases generally recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may present a higher risk of severe infection to COPID-19 according to data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data are missing for COPID-19. In some cases, COPID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COPID-19 can rapidly progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COPID-19, with renal failure being observed in 4% of those in this group.
About 20-30% of people with COPID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the mean time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total beach of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples present widespread alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cellular exudations in both lungs.
Viral cytopathetic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image is similar to a acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing diseases; availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The under-numbering of moderate cases may result in an overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current rate of mortality is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and had a higher risk of becoming ill or dying from non-smokers. Concerns were also seen with long-term consequences of the disease.
The hospital administration of Hong Kong observed a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some sick people, and pulmonary scanners suggested organic lesions.
This can also lead to an intensive post-care syndrome after treatment.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had a long-term effective immunity in sick people.
Immunity is considered likely to be based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of patients with COPID-19 following positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by the spread of the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively carried out by a transmission of man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first occurrence of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO has affected the emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for confirmed laboratory deaths in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for cases of COPID-19 diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed laboratory. The death/case report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global death/cash report is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) by 17 April 2020.
This number varies from region to region. Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious fatality rate (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of the disease-related contamination.
Although all infected people do not develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and in young people, creating a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and mortality rates are different in both men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk is for men aged five and over, the difference between men and women who are only 90 years of age.
In China, the rate of death was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be involved.
Immunological differences according to sex, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and human development in comorbidities such as hypertension at a lower age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data related to the type of infection in the COVID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly nurses, are women and present an increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of persons, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly referred to as ‘coronavirus’.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were often called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended using the names of 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCOV for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limits of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as fluctuations and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not provide it in time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 required valves in one night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and were rapidly spreading online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Test" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-COV is used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 both use the ACE 2 receiver to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are researched.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new infection with COPID-19.
A second strategy, subunit based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, these research focuses on the specular S protein that helps the virus to infiltrate into the receptor of the enzyme ACE 2.
A third strategy is the nuclear-acid-based vaccine (DNA or DNA vaccination, a new vaccine creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inoffensive genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway in April 2020.
Seven trials have evaluated approved treatments against malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reversional antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on remisivir in several countries with reports expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of vaccine and drug candidates against COPID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COPID-19, including remdisvir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remissevir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compassionate rexivir.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. The chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some ask for an independent analysis of research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that the double dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorisation to the discretion of physicians caring for COPID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or omifenevir against COPID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial specular protein depleted with serum transmembral protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the receptor of ACE 2.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complication at subsequent stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-choc properties. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
Phase 2 test is under way at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Associated with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify the cytokine shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be the origin of the death of certain affected persons.
The receptor antagonist of interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of cytokines refractory replication syndrome to steroids caused by a different cause, treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of individuals who have cured COVID-19 to persons who need it is under study as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few results.
Viral neutralisation is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody therapy can generate a defence against SARS-COV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The production of convalescent serum, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of patients who are cured and containing specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for a faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, then contracted COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
