Same as always ketane.
We were inside the ketane.
Same thing out there.
We're just going to be a k.
Same ketane.
We had one k that way.
We had the ketchup.
We're gonna blow a bell.
I'm fucking with the ketane.
We're gonna blow a little bit.
We've got bad bunnies, khetan.
We're doing bad noises or something.
We're doing a lot of damage to the ketane.
Do you believe that?
Is this my friend Tom you want to do?
Will he tell you about Tom now?
Are you interested in this restaurant?
Why are you thinking about what Tom's done with that fucking wood?
So?
I'm fucking Tom but he's playing him.
When I saw Thomas, I said, "He is stoned."
What do you have to do with sickness?
What about the library?
How?
Who said that Thomas should not make him?
Why do you never tell us?
Why did they tell us the story?
Why did Tom make them like this?
Why did Tom eat it?
Why does Tom Trubusardas have to do it?
Why does Tom have to do this?
Why would Tom have thought of having a turban made him?
Why does Tom have to do it for you?
Why does Tomeka like this suit?
Why does Tom faint to see me?
Why do you think they're a coward to me?
Why about Tom on the couch?
Why did Tom give you a piece of wood?
Why do you think Tom's a bad man?
Why?
Divo!
But without a word, the veil is torn in two.
Ramosar!
Come on.
Come on!
It's too bad you want Tomes to do it.
This is where you tell Thomas that you can't afford it.
And thou shalt tell me the name of a man's uncle.
If you're going down.
I'm afraid you will speak to me in person.
You're the only one who's seen Toms shores.
You're talking to Thomas Shore.
You're always an old man.
You are always ready.
It's a pain in the ass, mango.
You know, it's hard to see what a movie is.
