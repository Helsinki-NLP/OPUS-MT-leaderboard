Joseph Witko’s father: I saw Jesus in the white crowd
He's a charismatic.
The holy Mass of deliverance and healing, which he performed, brings the crowd back to life.
He was only a few years old when things began to go unexplained in his life.
Today, through Franciscan, others experience it.
To be executed by the Holy Mass of liberation and healing
They used to come to him with a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be surgery.
Joseph Witko’s father prayed about him.
On the same day the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Amazing doctors said: "Operation is not required, the death is only 1.5 mm".
The parents cried happily.
After another prayer, Franciscanine disappeared completely.
The Creator has begun to experience extraordinary spiritual activities as a teenager.
In a dream, pure souls came to him with a request for help.
I was awakened at night and compelled to pray for the dead and for those who died at the time of the resurrection.
He also experienced the presence of a wicked spirit.
And he had a vision of what would happen to a man who committed a mortal sin.
"My body began to change.
I lost my human characteristics and started taking back the animal's appearance," he says.
The invisible force took him up, couldn't get his voice out.
He felt lost.
Then God gave him salvation.
"Saturated in the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism of the holy, I was set free and returned to the human form...," he says.
He didn't tell anyone about those strange experiences.
It was an invitation.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he was not the only one to tell about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community Rejuvenation in the Holy Spirit
In the healing tables of Father Witko will be attended by many who are expected to recover from the disease.
However, the spiritual one emphasizes that their primary objective is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
First defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) on the afternoon of the Kolpinga FRAC team, the award was given to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogori Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd series of LOTTO Superligi Table Tennis.
Jaroslaving in such a personal set as they presented with the Grapes has no chance of winning with the League's sovereigns.
He showed this one with Dart Bogoria.
There's still a missing team called the team leader Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps a third of the triumphs of the new season would come with him.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has not yet grown up to win with such tusks as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, that is, the Badow Mark.
The racer from Hellady was the largest single star in MOSIR Hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both at the age of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were class for themselves.
After three units Kolping FRAC drove 2:1.
Kou Lei probably won the Badowski Mark, and Daniel Goroak after an emotional, five-year battle – Paul Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give you a chance.
It was possible to hope for a two-point victory, but Qiyao Han did not succeed in Badowska.
There will be no further studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Raphał Trzaskowski, a free prophylactic research programme for seniors aged 70 and 80 years was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and is subject to the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Classification.
For reasons, the agency explained that the target group was badly selected.
"These actions may also affect the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening difficulties in accessing NFZ services and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive results of studies," it said.
The decision of the resort doesn't understand the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we predicted the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are tested, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is just to lead to a situation where prevention can be made faster.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and the correct approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafal Trzaskowski.
“I find it hard to imagine that running specialists are saying, ‘Let’s not try, because there will be longer courses with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, it’s not surprising that there is a health service in this condition,’ said PO.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all the agreements so far
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that any agreement entered into with Israel would be broken if the future government of that country tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's decree on the annexes of the occupied Palestinian countries.
"If the future government of Israel, as it stands, will come to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.
"We reject the whole plan completely and completely," said Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means – little of which will be important – by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who has already made similar statements in July.
Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, again received a government-forming mission after the September 17 elections.
A week before his election, he ordered that if he wins, he announces the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intends to include in Israel all the Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that were sponsored by the United States.
At the UN General Assembly session, 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold a general election on Palestinian lands.
They were last held in 2006.
"After returning to the country, I called on the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem local elections and all those who opposed them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President declared.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, for the use of the powers of "full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his call for the international community to "force Israel to comply with all respect for the United Nations provisions".
The Ambassador of Israel Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "does prefer to focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Autonomous Government against Israel rather than to fight the calls for terrorism in the Autonomous Region under its leadership".
Danon, as the agencies say, did not, however, refer to the annexes of the occupied Palestinian lands promised by Netanya.
Warriors want defibrillators at the neural points of the Mind
The history of border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human life.
The Duke of the Rattunk Conciliation Station in the Mind wants such devices to be found in the city's neural points.
In their position, the officials received congratulations from the Vyvodzhýdz Institute of Ratunktoy in the Process.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wojcik are officials of the Podkarpackic Office of the Treasurer's Customs Office.
On 28 August, they served on the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. The official of the Customs-Skarb Service noticed a man lying unconscious in a pedestrian area.
The Chinese activist died in prison for torture.
He wanted to take advantage of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, a woman activist, on 23 September, the secretary of the Communist Party from her family village called to inform her husband that he had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In Cao's bones, she saw the body of a man slaughtered, not for recognition.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," says a woman.
"They didn't let me take my cell phones with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of a "bad accident".
105 million zł for companies from the video game industry from the National Research and Development Centre
Almost 105 million dollars of funding comes from gaming companies, creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR were the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR game engine creating a real-world map along with an application for the transmission of data by users; a testing-training platform for the verification of practical skills at work and professional excellence using VR and AI technology; an innovative game for the management of real-time production processes using an innovative model for the interaction of the virtual world with the real-world concept of industry 4.0 – a communication from the NCBR sent on Friday to the PAP.
The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video games producers in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at 10% a year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish market video game in 2016 was 1.85 billion zł and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"A specially prepared gameINN research agenda and already reaching 300 million zł support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme is an important impetus for further, dynamic growth of Polish games," we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“Incentives to innovative entrepreneurs such as B+R benefits, excellence programmes, IP box or NCB support programmes encourage innovative companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a highly competitive market,” assesses Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the science resort points out that money for innovation not only reaches innovations in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – with the support of B+R in 2018, three quarters more entrepreneurs than a year earlier.
‘The estimated costs for B+R activities amounted to 1,7 billion zł, giving more than 300 million złs of savings for companies benefiting from this benefit.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCB in the three editions of GameINN," the Deputy Prime Minister stressed.
The Director of the NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniki recalls, however, that 78 innovative projects were awarded over 211.2 million in the two previous funding tenders.
The huge interest in competition III and the variety of applications made show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and enhance its competitive advantages.
"It is particularly gratifying that there are projects on solutions not only for entertainment but also for industry 4.0," he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to 20 million zł, entrepreneurs, consortium of entrepreneurs and consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply.
The NCBR had 87 applications for the total amount of funding of approximately 317 million zł.
The tender budget at the time of the award was 100 million zł, but it was increased, thus granting almost 105 million zł funding to the 27 projects.
Detailed information on the results of GameINN competition III is available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sector Programme is implemented under the Operational Intelligent Development Programme.
NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Game Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11-bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admitted to stealing Kaspera Dolberg's watch
It happened on September 16th.
Dolberg, who finally arrived from Ajacs Amsterdam to Nice, turned to training that his watch had disappeared from the closet.
It's not like that, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dunzczka didn't show up on the classes the next day, interpreting stomach problems.
The matter was a mystery from the beginning.
The footballers in the closet have private safes available, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, he was finally admitted to the Diaby-Fadiga.
At 18 years of age, he apologized to Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised Dunnsky to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising footballers of a young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old, three years later, to debut in the first team.
This season was held in seven matches.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as L'Equipe reported, the club is likely to dissolve it with immediate effect.
At the same time, a disciplinary action was taken against his opponent.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of infections, we need to do it properly.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to remove the dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands to a sufficient degree.
And most of us are shorter!
Just warm water and regular soap – it’s not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors hand it down).
We wash not only the lower and upper hands, but also: the limbs of the fingers (joined or individually) – wipe them with the knee movements of the other hand, the space between the fingers (clay your hands, rub your fingers on yourself), the fingers – each finger includes the other hand and in such a hug we turn them right and left.
In an emergency (when you can't wash your hand) we should shake your hand with a wet cough and then use an antibacterial iron (in dregs, 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch your hands or the door (the recommendation of the Health Inspector General).
Open it through the paper manual.
The President of Iran says he has rejected the US offer, Donald Trump rejects
Tehran did not hold talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the American offer of sanctions – President Hasan Rowhani announced on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that this is an Iranian party asking for the removal of restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to President Hasan Rowhani of Iran, the United States has proposed the abolition of all the sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistics building programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not take talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said he did not agree to this conversation because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He declared that he had met with American diplomats because he was in favour of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not take talks in the atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1 format, nobody is able to predict what the outcome will be," Rowhani said.
On the day before, the Iranian leader said he was not excluding talks from the United States, and he accused European parties of favouring US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US entered into a nuclear agreement "with an initial condition that does not allow" to engage in dialogue.
If we can take this condition off and if America is going to take sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation in the coming week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no."
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian side request.
"Iran wanted me to bear the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said no! The president of the United States.
Voltage with an atomic agreement in the ground
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in some way to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which was signed by the signatories.
It stated that, in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would withdraw from the nuclear-weapon-building programme and the nuclear sector would be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the May 2015 agreement, its signatories have consistently confirmed their wish to maintain the agreement in force.
It didn't work out for the moment.
Washington is using the maximal pressure strategy for Iran, and sanctions include the full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran said that if it does not receive the export authorisation of the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement by 60 days.

The Court of Justice of the Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the strike against the judges, was re-elected on Wednesday to be found by the NSA.
The reason: the disciplinary procedure has not been initiated against him, so there is no reason to support the administration of the WSA Mr Mazura to withdraw him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary speaker at the NSA, initiated an investigation against Smydt at the end of August, but it has not yet been transformed into an action against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must take a decision by the President of the US within a month of its issue.
In this situation, the judge who publicly spoke about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office because of suspicions of participation in the heresy group, will return to office and issue judgments on behalf of the Polish Republic.
Judge Smydt opposes his participation in the Heterian Group.
He claims that he has no evidence of this except for the fake screens and his wife's words to divorce.
That is exactly what the judges say: all are innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they're on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't shake his finger to secure evidence from their electronic carriers, he also kept silent about the content of the phone Emili Smydt, which was the phone that stopped in June in another case.
The police didn't shake their finger to protect the devices of people whom they as persecutors pointed out in a report from February judge Waldemar Žurek.
There's no evidence – there's no Smydt case, there's no "Cash" case.
Also, there is no case with Chief Marian Banasi about renting a stone to the Sutners and concealing income.
The CBA shall verify its statement of assets.
And he'll check when he checks.
The Committee on Business Ethics will not take part in the Banas because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee of State Control has somehow gathered to take a decision to revoke the representatives of Banas and to call as its legislator, although the law does not provide for such an extraordinary combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American mistake about how a wife goes home and stands up with a boyfriend in bed.
She's so amazed and confused she can't spell words.
She's standing in the door unwinding, and at the time, the lover jumps out of bed, clothes and goes out.
And her husband's stuck in bed.
When a wife regains her voice and cries out: "What is this to be?"
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks, "What kind of woman, honey?"
It's just that in the case of Casta or Banasa, it's a state parade.
And that's not funny.

Kamila Litzwinko in the final jump above
Previously returning to the season to compete after the break of the mother's race, the bronze medalist of the world championships from London 2017, in the first attempt to defeat 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
It has only succeeded in achieving it in a third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the end, I will have to jump more technically," she admitted to the Eurosport camera Ličwinko.
In the best disposals, Americans Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karina Demidik appeared after 1.94.
Both fighters as the only ones did not lose any height.
The final jump over women was scheduled for Monday.
Starting at 7:30 p.m. Polish time.
Cornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in difficulty
He's gone to the hospital, and his doctors call him a tough guy.
You have to add that he's aware and aware.
"We believe that it will come out of it again.
We all pray for him to come back to health," said an anonymous close friend of Kornel Morawiecki in a conversation with the newspaper Super Express.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running to the Senate.
"My closest family and politics are keeping me alive," said Cornel Morawiecki in an interview that he gave two weeks ago to the newspaper Super Express.
In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Cornel Morawiecki was studying at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I experienced strange, disturbing symptoms and reported to the hospital.
It turns out I have a yellow.
But the worst was in front of me.
When a computer tomographer survey was conducted, it was found that I had a new pancreas..." said the Prime Minister's father.
A few days later, a serious operation took place at MSViA Hospital in Warsaw, Cornel Morawiecki.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Prince Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and ran successfully.
"I know that many people have prayed for me for which I am very grateful.
Luckily, I don't have a break.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I give myself to doctors of specialists who are rather good thoughts.
I have to go back to some state of use after this difficult operation.
I hope everything will be all right," said Cornel Morawiecki in January in the conversation with the "SE".
"If I were too late to study, the situation would be tragic and I'd say goodbye to this fall..." he added.
Kraków: She's 14-year-old.

When she was last seen, she was dressed in blue, gray underwear and shoes.
Anyone who has any information on the missing is requested to contact the police under No. 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
Power of light jumps.
The title of the relationship between amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon, September 15th at a hypodrome on Oleandra Street in Olava, may be for some mistaken.
To the real strength of the road, because far away, but this is what I call one of the kind of horse racing...
The race for jumps is to be won by the rider and horses, which in the most prestigious international races exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that the long and still uninhabitable record of the world, established still in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the "Huaso" horse, is 247 cm.
So high in Olaw, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is also the worst...
The trades organised by the unmanned Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS "In the Seat", constituted an indicative part of the earlier "Earth occupations" of which we write more in this issue on page 22.
Eight amazons trained in oil mining in the U.S.
Four of them competed on hips and four on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szołdra was the best person to write down the crazy "Sprinter".
The small, but how dynamic the space began to rise from 40 cm to 125 cm in diameter and ended at the station with a top white away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily, and only after three further refusals was the competition jury removed from the competition.
Amelia Pawlak, a member of the family, and the third Lena Borunj on the Harmider, took the second place in the jumps.
Inga Aksman, who is galloping and leaping through obstacles to the little "Carmen".
Even greater emotions have been associated with starting amazons and seeing the competition with the participation of large horses.
Terrible dropouts included Paulina Szewczyk, a "Declaration" and Anastazja Abramenko, who went to "Lotce".
Luckily, there was nothing wrong with the small funerals, the Amazons, and the horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
She had a lot of problems with the introduction of the "Wineta" to the park.
She needed either an assistant coach or another horse to the pair, followed by some crazy "Wineta".
After counting the obstacle from the park, she also went full-fledged, so moments in the boxes and in the spacecraft became dangerous. "Everything is under control!", Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down a little of the frightened sights, especially the younger ones.
From the start of the competition of the big horses, Marta Masalska has been a great guest in the park, with a beautiful ‘Whisky’ presentation.
This decent mat, in a pair of experienced amazons, after the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result at that time.
At the same time, however, Paulina Szewczyk was also counted as "Declaration", Heronika Lüczkiewicz as "Winece" and Anastazja Abramenko as "Lotce".
So all these racers went out together to decorate the fleet and after receiving the freight prizes in the shape of the rider's equipment, and finally, together with the amazons on the cushions in the March of Radecki, they performed an effective round of honor, finishing it with these interesting and exciting races.
Thank you.
The Jäzděcki Sport Club "In Siodle" warmly thanks to the sponsors of the competition for the power of the jump during the 16th "Dutch Jäzděckých": the City Office in Olaw, the Water and sewerage plant in Olaw, the Aviation Age and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko Abroad from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution Mariusza Max Colonki was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution has directed its proposal, in particular, to young people with legal views.
Before the Kolonko elections, he ordered cooperation with Mark James Kukiz, or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions did happen, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko was unable even to collect enough signatures to show the letters in any electoral district in Poland.
Now Kolonko informed Twitter that he had completed his collaboration with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I'll expect to delete my name from KWW.
Please allow me not to connect my person with the person mentioned," he added and ordered more information soon.
At the moment it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work, whether it is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4th, on the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, in the United States, informed about the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has been able to comment on events in Poland and the world by conducting a YouTube channel on Max TV.
"We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It was time for the authorities in the country to take over the people and rule for the good of the people," Kolonko said.
The programme covers, inter alia, matters relating to the judiciary (to be chosen in general elections), tax changes (comparation of tax-free amounts for all), military repairs (as military assistance for the countries of the eastern part of NATO, with particular regard to Poland), the holding of arms referendums, the reduction of the number of ambassadors or the introduction of a single-month electoral rounds.
A few days after the announcement of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined in the talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted in his profile in social media information suggesting that #R will connect forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions have finally arrived.
UBS: Gold close to balance point
"The euro course will last for the next few months in the vicinity of the cap of 4,35 zł, so that there will be a weak economy in global markets," Michael Bolliger, from UBS Wealth Management, says.
"The expectation of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy is talking about stabilising gold notes on the current stage," the expert in the Bankier.pl talks.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure of the Monetary Policy Council, the Council does not decide to raise its feet in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are making policy easier.
"If gold is properly valued – euro ratings should be maintained in the next few months in the area of cap 4,35 zl – there are so little attractive Polish bonds according to it.
Much more cost-effective than Polish paper offer bonds from emerging markets," says Michael Bolliger, head of the allocation of assets to emerging markets with UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
"The global slowdown can be further deepened, but there should not be a severe recession, and, above all, the GDP dynamics are slightly below zero," Michael Bolliger says.
“Investments should not be taken into account by investors for global actions that may damage the lack of prospects for a US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and brexit.
Europe should remain relatively weak in the stock markets," the latest list for investors of the main authority managing UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele shows.
"The euro area shares should be treated worse than the Americans, because they are more vulnerable in terms of increased uncertainty about global trade and fears before slowing down," we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the fall in the bond markets of the most secure countries had pushed German profitability down to less than 0.74 per cent, it is still possible to deepen the loss of profitability.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term and short-term securities should no longer fall due to the adjustment of monetary policy by banks.
The biggest field to lower feet has Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the next year's horizon.
The long-term balance sheet for euro banknotes is a fall in USD 1.29, which would mean a 19-percent potential to strengthen the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed's feet, which will result in a reduction in the world's monetary policy.
"The long-term maintenance of the dollar can prevent current and budgetary deficits," Michael Bolliger says.
Bundeswehra loses his weapon.
German MON's Confidential Report
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammunition – the result of the secret assembly of the RFN defence facility.
Information was provided by the press belonging to the media group EditorsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the Parliamentary Office, the Secretary of State at MON Peter Tauber (CDU) has so far been able to remeasure two weapons, one part of the weapons and 3474 ammunition.
Among the military equipment that is still missing are six MG3, 11 G3, 11 G3, four G36 automatic carbines, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 slots are missing for MG3 machine carabines.
The situation was alarmed by the Vice-President of the Levica Party, Martin Renner.
As RND reporters have said, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "stirring".
Moreover, only a small part of the lost equipment was found as a result of the investigation.
Martina Renner summarised the effects of these actions as "necessary balances".
She also criticised the fact that the composition did not show whether there was also a weapon found during the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehry Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor of Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the State and violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing threats to Germany's leading policies with extreme legal and racist incentives.
His "black list" of goals, which came into the hands of the prosecutor, included the former Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, the human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally took four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying kids on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There's a solution.
The Japanese Airlines has recently used a function designed to help people who travel with their crying child.
By means of the website, the lines allow the aircraft to check the location of the aircraft.
If the connection is a minor to the second year of life, the "child icon" appears on a specific, reserved by parents or guardians of the seat.
The same person using the carrier's services is able to choose a place away from that occupied by a small person.
The BBC reports that the lines have already informed about the incompetence of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third person or if the last moment a change has occurred.
As expected, the idea was shared by the Internet.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved by listening to noise reduction.
They're kids, we used to be them.
"We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need maps of places for breathing, mixing or drinking," said user G Sundar.
Another of the netizens noticed that he had been harassed by children crying on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also no need for Japanese Airlines to issue a solution.
"Thank you for warning me against screaming children during a 13-hour trip," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Major counts losses after bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's office
More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not arrive in October on leave to Majorka as a result of the announcement on Monday of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook's travel office.
As reported on Friday, an autonomous representative of the Balearic government of Marc Pons, among the 25 thousand contemporaries who would not be able to take advantage of the October leave in Majorce, are also those who were to travel with companies directly related to Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Ponso explained that 80% of the expected contemporaries who, due to the collapse of the British company, had to give up their retirement in Majorce next month were German citizens and Scandinavian states.
However, as Pons claims, Thomas Cook did not drive tourists on the Balearic Islands during the November-April period, losses for the local economy will be smaller.
He found that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators on "the entry into the market of Majorka" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people lose their jobs in October due to the major tourist crisis.
About 800 is the released Thomas Cook office staff in Palmie.
Other people lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many hotels Majorka property owners requested an extra charge for the night.
The situation has experienced, among other things, a few hundred tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Islands estimates that by Thursday, several hundred hotels in Majorce had stopped at least until the end of October in connection with Thomas Cook's announcement of bankruptcy and the cooperating companies.
In turn, the Friday newspaper "Dario de Ibiza" indicates that most of the hotels working in Ibiza, which collaborated with Thomas Cook, are not dealing with the intention of closing the premises in the next few weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankruptcy cooperated with 42 hotels.
In the middle of the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would contact the Spanish Government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook's travel office.
They discovered that the most damaged on this tourist archipelago, about 36,000 people, is located on Majorce.
According to the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is a local tourist company, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July to September 2019 of around EUR 5 million.
Ranking FIFA women.
Poland still on 29th place, USA on the front
The Polish Women's Representation takes 29th place in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking, published on Friday.
At the same position, the team of Coach Milosz Stapiński was classified in the previous July composition.
It's a weak sword of leather.
How's it going to be in October?
The remaining American leaders have recently defended the title of the world’s champions.
The second place in the ranking was kept by the Germans, and the third remaining Dutchmen.
The Poles are preparing to qualify as ME.
They were supposed to start the match with the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed a year – due to food poisoning.
In this situation, the Polish are innovating the qualifications for the meeting with Spain on 12 November in Lublin.
Previously "White-Red" played two games – October 3rd on a trip from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielcach with Brazil.
In the group of rivals Poland are representatives of Spain, Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The winners of the group and the three best teams from other places advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from other positions are playing in the barracks with the last three trips to the European Championships.
The number of 16 participants will be filled by the host – England.
The male representation of Poland in the FIFA ranking in September fell from 20th to 22nd.
“Rz”: Smog oppressed the government
"The effects of the clean air program are zero, and the carbon furnaces will dig up this winter as if nothing ever," we read on the first page of today's "Rzeczpospolitje".
“To date, 82,000 applications have been submitted under the Clean Air programme for funding of a total value of 2 billion zł, of which 48,000 have been positive.
Approved proposals amount to over 915 million zł, "Rz", referring to data from the spokesperson of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred is returned from the programme.
The results of the maliciously announced programme are considered to be "low".
Self-governments quoted by “Rz” are facing defeats of “Clean Air” in, among other things, too large a bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, e-mail invoices, possible performance checks.
This would improve the action," said Mayor Jacek Wisniowski of the Warmin Bar.
According to the Polish Smog alert, less than 1 per cent of the planned target for the first year of action was less than 3 million miners.
Although the programme budget is 103 billion dollars per 10 years, i.e. 10 billion dollars per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management this year, 1.4 billion zł has been reserved," we read.
Congress agrees with F-35 for Poland
Blaščak: Now price negotiations
The Congress of the United States agreed to sell Poland 32 of the latest F-35 aircraft.
"It's one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work," Mariusz Błasczak wrote on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best price," the Polish minister added.
Agreement on the Polish F-35
Polish Air Force have a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fishermen produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the Department of State of the United States expressed its consent to their sale in Poland.
The Communication stressed that investment in support of national security and the US foreign policy by improving the security of NATO's allies, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for fishing.
However, this is not the final price.
The Department of State noted that the contract would also include the provision of spare parts and repair equipment, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics and programme support and staff training.
Thinker Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lighting II thinker produced by Lockheed Martin is a multitasker of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombing and typically fishing tasks for air combat.
Through the use of steel technology, the hunter is undetectable for radars near reach.
Recently, F-35 fishermen bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the old F-16.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, should also consider the purchase of American warplanes.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Men's or boys' breeches
The producer of Barbie placed a series of sex-neutral dolls on the market.
He wants to fight stereotypes this way.
Barbie's producer has placed a series of sex-neutral dolls on the market.
Next to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced the sale of neutral sex dolls.
"Creable World" toys carry feathers.
So children can decide whether Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both underwear and dresses.
In the swelling of the eyes of the dolls, the girls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothing.
It was also rejected by emphasising the characteristics of gender characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouth, long beards and narrow waist or – in the case of Kena – broad shoulders.
The company believes that children don't like their dolls having their sex standards set, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a view to specific sex inhibit girls' ambitions and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will allow all children to feel free," says Mattel.
Ms. Barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in the bathroom and high-end shoes, was in the past repeatedly criticized for the promotion of "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
The group has responded to criticism and has already placed on the market dolls of different skin colors as well as more round shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijabe.
Zandberg: The bike or club Together can have a couple of letters
Zandberg asked for ZET radio , how many candidates of his party can get to Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the list starts candidates to SLD, Spring and Levicy Together, starting with the common logo "Levica"), replied that this depends on the committee's outcome.
"I believe that the outcome of Levia will be very good, because we feel that people are bound by the hope that Levia is not only right, but also strong," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 ambassadors.
“This may mean that the club or the club together will have a couple of letters.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I won't agree and tell you how it's going to happen," he said.
Asked if Levica together would have a separate circle, Zandberg refused: “We are committed to being different, and we will not pretend that there is no difference.
I think this diversity has been rewarded by the Polish because we have shown that, by different means, we have been able to deal with the common programme."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD leader Vladzimir Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he thought the biggest beneficiaries were central and left-wing voters.
In the light of the fact that this SLD will receive the full grant, he denied that "the political party's goal is to represent its electors".
Zandberg admitted that in his election to Sejm, he voted against himself.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he said he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to which my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further," he said.
"I say very honestly and clearly that if I found myself in circle 44, I would take an election statement and vote in a different circle," he stressed.
"I don't think I'd try to vote in favour of Minister Kazimierz Drivenowski (KO-PAP candidate)," he added.
In this district outside of the driveway, the leader of the population of RP Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are launched.
Dakar: The biggest match opened in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge match, considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car and foot to the Bopp district, where a new match could accommodate 30,000 faithful ones.
The object was built by the brotherhood of Mouride, which belongs to the Sufi nude of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the match began ten years ago in a submerged area of six hectares of government.
The name of Massalikul Jinan ("The Path to Paradise") is derived from the title of the poem Ahmado Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, honored by the scholars as saints.
The brand is covered with a career marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The sword is in the midst of 15,000 faithful ones, and the other one can be on the outside.
In the richly completed interiors you can admire the golden dome, giant gyrandales and handmade decorations by workers from Morocco.
The builders say the match is the largest in West Africa, but gmach and so there is no comparison to the match in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassana II match in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The facility, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed from private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, has lost its lighting, sanitary equipment and financed road work worth EUR 10.5 million.
Trainer Smile: Our problem is not Słęsk, just us alone
The pass of eight league matches without winning the Corona ball will try to break off at Friday's meeting with the Vice-Chancellor of the Silesian Extraclass.
"Our problem is not to celebrate, just us, we have to work on what we play," the coach Mirosław Smile stressed.
The last and as so far as the only victory in the people has been recorded in the first row, when on the departure they won the 1:0 benamin games of the Częstochow Cancers.
Later, the count recorded two remissions and six defeats, and on Tuesday, they lost 0:1 with Lubin in the 1/32 finals of the Polish Pucharu.
“I am impressed by the optimism that in the last few seconds the footballers were fighting for the gate, they wanted to resign.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle was not due to a break, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smile.
As he pointed out, Słösk has very strong wings, which is why he will feel the team on the side of the boxing sector.
"We are aware of the opponent's quality, but we also look at what we want to play," the coach added.
In a Friday match in the Crown, it certainly does not play a pause for the excess of the yellow cards Firen Gnjatic, which will also miss the conjugated Jacob Žubrowski and Michael Gardowski.
But it's building to report to a team of players who want to play.
"We have headaches, it has recently seemed that he will not, and now he is," said Smile.
The defender of Corona Daniel Dzewniel stressed that Słąsk would not be an easy match to break the track of eight league matches in a row without winning, but in an extraclass everyone can win with each one.
"We're a good team.
In the last few weeks, we may not show this in the fight, but the moment will come that we will win and believe that it will be Friday," the baller pointed out.
After nine rows of extraclass Corona with a five-point coin, it takes 15th position.
The spleen has gathered about 12 more and is afraid of the second place.
The fifth match in Kielcach will start at 8:30.
These trees can disappear completely from Europe
"42% of species of trees on Europe's woodland are at risk," warns the International Union for Nature Protection (IUCN) in a Friday 'Red Paper of European Trees'.
There are cassettes and jacuzzi on the front of the list.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was prepared by experts who, on the basis of the studies, concluded that 42% of the 454 species of trees in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) are "highly endangered".
Among the reasons the Red Paper shares the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, these trees and plants are most at risk, which occur only or mainly on our continent.
In the case of a typical European tree, according to IUCN experts, 58% of species are threatened, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and plants, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper lists errors in the exploitation of woodland, accelerated urbanisation, too intense a tree line, and further the fire of forests and changes occurring in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, there is also a strong threat to the existence of many European varieties of herbs, flies and vegetables.
"The consequences of human activity lead to a gradual disappearance of European plant species and threatens to eradicate major and underestimated varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," said the report Luc Bas, which heads the European IUCN office.
Gregorz Schetyna: Not available 600+
"Today, PiS wants to repurchase Polaków, offering them the freedom of distribution for a loan that will have to pay for future generations," says Gregorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolitj".
In his opinion, "the entire PiS policy is pizza".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be forbidden".
Shetyna assures in her conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that she has an idea of combating the law and justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the polling stations.
In his view, the opposition has greater potential in this regard than the Kaczyn party.
"Today, the conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than the supporters of the PiS, a party that has mistrusted itself with the voting values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Shetina.
The leader of the People's Coalition and the President of the Citizens' Platform also noted the fundamental foundations of the KO electoral programme.
"First, nothing will be taken away from the data, but the direction to the future must be determined, because the PiS is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, even if it is a dramaticly low investment," he said.
Secondly, it is about "use of Polish energy, aid and investment in those who really work - and those who are business".
Shetyna explains that the KO programme included a project that gives Poland at least more than 614 gold per hand and more gold per hand – also after several sets.
The politician also said he didn't want to race for divorce.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he doesn't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the leaders have argued with the opposition to redundancy, until the financial country has finally fallen," he stressed.
The Shetyna in the interview for "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczynski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Malgorzat Kidaw-Blonski.
"We'd love to see their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“The dog is moving ahead of the fall.
Kaczynski is a man of state like Banas is crystalline," he added.
Leader PO also said that he has not yet decided whether to apply for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Large Condors
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz there were six dead large condors – reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Condors are likely to be poisoned by means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten toxic waste.
Besides one young person, the rest of the dead condors were grown up.
“This is a great loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of propagation.
So we lose the protected species, the endangered species," says Luis Jacobe, director of the BioAndina Foundation, a Argentine environmental organisation.
"I think that the use of toxic substances and toxic substances affects not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
'Rz': They want a dress for the President
They've been working on the recognition of the head of the state of the expensive chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Dudy’s office – we read in "Rzeczpospolitje".
According to the newspaper, it is about the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the Royal Insignium officially known during the period of the inter-military siege of the Rzecipospolitan.
The last time he was probably used by President Ignacy Mištsky.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain can hit Andrzej Dudy's shoulder.
The Senate Commission on Human Rights, Justice and Petitions voted in favour of a proposal for a new law on orders and designations to restore them.
The newspaper says it's not the first attempt to bring this chain back to the head of the state.
The Senate has already proposed this amendment in 1992, but it has failed with one vote.
This time, the work is brilliant.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they would have the opinion of the President's Office.
It came in mid-September.
"I am pleased that the Office of the President of the RP does not take note of the position presented in this petition," President Andrzej Dera wrote.
On Wednesday, the Senate commission continued and again devoted little time to the case.
"The President's office replied briefly: it is for this to be restored," said the chief of the commission Robert Mamutov of PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He has tabled a proposal for legislative work, which the Commission has supported.
Cops will teach drivers how to drive by crossing
The police action will be conducted, inter alia, at the crossroads of Al-Teplinski from Al-Pilsudski.
There is little connection between the recent complaints by the city authorities to drivers who are not always able to handle the crossing properly.
On Friday, September 27th, the police are launching preventive actions in the Rzeszov "Transmission crossings".
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: going to crossroads without getting out, not using light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and so we really make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, the vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words were echoed at a press conference, where the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars after crossings, which results in shocks.
At that time, the president called on travellers to reason on the road, including faster movement in the light or not writing SMS during the ride.
The issue has been taken up by the Soviet policemen who have been launching the "Transmission crossings" action since today.
What's the matter?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the occurrence of a restriction on cross-sectional traffic by drivers who drive to it without the possibility of continuing the drive.
It is a frequent exaggeration that contributes to aggravation of the difficulty in movement and the creation of corks.
It is threatened with a mandate of 300 zł and 2 points of punishment.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to non-use of light signals or road signs and irregular parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of running fluid, late movement of signalers, free passage of crossings, and too much distance between vehicles.
What intersections will take place?
M.in. on Lisa-Kuli Street from Jajiellońska Street; al. Cieplinski from al. Piłsudski; Targowska Street from al. Piłsudski; Plac Přeniawitti from ul. Dębrowski Street or ul. Hetmanski Street from al. Poustans of Warsaw.
Such shares in the capital of Podcarpacia will be held next Friday October.
They checked the company's waste disposal company from "Czajki"
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Old Age of the German and Provincial Sciences of the Inspectorate of the Construction Control checked the installations in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the clean-up of the "Czajka" rivers in Warsaw was used on Friday," reported the spokesman for the Old Age of the Italians Karol Szyszko.
The inspectors of the Roman age carried out controls at a plant located in the forests of the municipality of Zielonka.
The "Dar-Trans" Private Trade-Trans Service, under the agreement with the "Czajka" municipal waste treatment plant, performs the services of handling waste.
"An installation was made of carbon, and an entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his activities," Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be transmitted, among other things, to the Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last check in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.
However, it was found that the company did not collect samples, measurements and groundwater studies and did not have the results of the studies of stabilised municipal sewage plants from the treatment plant "Czajka".
Following the control of WIOS Dariusz Sobota, it was called upon to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Private Store "DAR-TRANS" Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies that collect waste in the form of stabilised municipal sewage deposits from the cleanup plant "Czajka".
In accordance with the decision to consume waste in the production area, in forests around the Greens, waste is processed by weight up to 60,000 tonnes per year.
The Warsaw City Water and sewerage company reported last Thursday that on November and December 2018, STUOS was excluded from operation, which was related to the damage of one of the combustion plants.
As MPWik reported, their monthly export cost is 1.7 million zł (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Waluss has supported Malgorzata Kidada-Blonski.
"You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support," Lech Wałęs told Malgorzata Kidawy-Blonski on Friday.
"Mr President, this is a very important word for me," replied the candidate of the People's Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, it is now "only a kibi on retirement".
Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonski met with former President Lech Wallace at his office at the Gdańsk European Solidarity Centre on Friday.
In a short conversation behind the closed doors, the son of Wałęsa — Jarosław — also took part.
"You took on a difficult task," he said after a meeting with Lech Waluss.
"You can count on my full support," he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to us all.
That is why it is a great hope that you as a woman will deal with these problems, and we all – those who love Poland – will be the maximum support for your actions," said the former president, returning to the Kidawa-Blonski.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Blonski thanked you for your support.
"Mr President, this is very important to me because no one, like you, can talk about freedom, about constitutions and knows how important this is," she said.
"Let us show that we can do another, wise policy, together, but in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
That's how you did your revolution, and that's how we want to change Poland," Kidawa-Blonski stressed.
Kibic on retirement
Wałåsa, in his interview with the journalists, said that he is now "only a kibi on retirement".
"Of course I look at it.
I hope we reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, will be returned.
The triad of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all of this needs to be cleared, all of it needs to be restored to normal action, and I believe we're doing it this time.
'Cause if not, we're waiting for a street criterion," Lech Wallace said.
"That is why it is so important for the Polish to go to the elections, decide and decide on their own.
And that's the most important thing," said Kidawa-Blonski.
"Last chance we'll improve the status of things in Poland," the former president replied.
"We must build on a new foundation"
Asked about the most important changes to be made to Poland, Kidawa-Blonski said: "The President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If there is no trifle of power, if the constitution is not respected, we need to go back to the beginning and lead to it to become obvious and to all know that otherwise Poland will not move forward."
ME networkers: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in semifinal.

The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted without amendment a law on the disclosure of the property of the most important public officials and of the most important persons in the country.
In the wake of the bill on the property of state officials - without amendment - 52 senators voted, 14 opposed, three abstained from voting.
The same senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during the Wednesday debate by Senator PO Sławomir Rybicki.
According to the amendment, they had the law to "civilize" and to limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the situation of the property of their own children, the children of the spouse, the children adapted to the cases in which the children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make the statement.
The Act on the Publicity of the Family of the Most Important State Officials, which was established in the Prime Minister's Office, was adopted by the Sejm on 11 September.
The provisions stipulate that, inter alia, the Prime Ministers, Ministers, Ambassadors, Ambassadors to the EP, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Chief Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those at the head of other State institutions, will be required to place property information on the property of the spouses, children and persons remaining in common interest.
The Senate also did not propose an amendment to the law on the flights of the most important persons in the country.
It regulates which flights have the status of HEAD and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for the conduct of the Central Register of Flights.
According to the law – without amendment – 55 senators spoke out, 12 opposed, four abstained from the vote.
In accordance with the statute, each flight of the President will be a flight "in the official mission".
Members of the family and others invited by the President will be able to accompany the President in the flights.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of Sejm and the Senate will only be "to be carried out in order to carry out tasks directly related to the full function".
The Act also specifies the list of persons who can accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
Members of delegations may be invited, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational services; and journalists.
In accordance with the law, if there is doubt about the fleets of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will explain them.
If such doubts are not explained in due time, the head of the KPRM will be required to notify the heads of the Sejm office or the Senate of the absence of the possibility to organise such a flight.

Poles after first training in Paris, waiting for the last race
Polish netizens took their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will compete in a bronze medal game on Saturday.
Vitala Heynen's escape route closed the Thursday failure with the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their troubles on the journey to this one.
This time, without such problems, they met with the Slovaks on Friday morning in the charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the relationship between the people present at work, the world’s champions were undermining.
As Assistant Heyneł Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of the sitar elements itself.
“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semifinal failure was a painful lesson for both the racers and the training staff.
"We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without two words, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd get back to this game.
We were discussing this game with each other in the stable, the coach talked a lot to the contestants.
As two main causes of failure, I would indicate inability in the attack and much worse than I would normally have to deal with the situational balls.
The Slovaks were much better than us," he said.
In his view, "White-Red" did not become an obstacle to the stress associated with the performance against the popular and numerous public co-sponsorship of the tournament.
He admitted that the world's champions could have had some smooth way to the semifinal.
"Perhaps if we had a similar failure in the group phase, we would be faster to analyze this lesson and then play at the next stage of the tournament.
But it's just a scratch," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with a Thursday's Polish defeat will turn into an aggression game of brown.
"I hope that we will then show our true faces.
There's nothing to fight about.
The last ME medal we fought in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Polish during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two meetings of the group, they went to Apeldoorn, and to the semifinal they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: harsh punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week start-up ban and a fine of $25,000, a half-year suspension, for forced words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour operators are losing patience with Kyrgyz, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the performances of the most unaccompanied professional tennis player in recent years seems terrible – 16 weeks of interruption plus a lot of crime, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which the mountain sportsman will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgyz is only 24 years old, but has been working out for a long time and has made his own tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of conduct on and next to him.
The loud spells, the strange gestures, the unsporting behavior, the injury of the judge and the sights, the breakup of two rockets during the lost match with Karen Chačanov – all after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113 thousand.
In the US Open 2019 he did not play for long, but he was able to say publicly that ATP operators "are corrupt", which caused so much damage to the organization's authorities that they conducted a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgyz and, after a couple of weeks, they gave the above-mentioned adjournment certificate and another fine.
However, he was forgiven the word of corruption after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, in the reasoning to the tennis industry, the investigation showed that Kyrgyz’s behaviour over the last 12 months has in many cases raised serious reservations and constituted a nearly continuous violation of the principles that he has been injuring the Vulture-related person and the sights without interruption, from which there is a high penalty.
ATP, however, gave him five days to appeal and immediately dismissed the verdict, ordering him to comply within the next six months with several conditions: in the tournaments ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the Code of Conduct of Professional Tennisists, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy rockets, fight with judges and the public, and no other way of acting unfavorable and vulgar.
He also received a recommendation to seek "continuous support" from mental coaches during the tournaments and also outside the season he consulted with people specialising in solving sports problems that did not deal with proper behaviour.
Nick Kyrgyz’s first comment (in social media) was as follows: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, since in Puchare Lavera, he had to stop at the nearest start in Beijing (September 30 – October 6) and Shanghai (October 6–13).
The ATP Kyrgios ranking takes 27th place.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earned over 1.3 million dollars, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: More and more lives in Poland
The report published by the GUS on the budgets of households, published on Friday, shows that as a good or rather good estimate of its material situation, up to 44% of them.
This percentage year was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and earlier, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective estimates of the situation of households, it never exceeded 30%.
Its material situation was considered to be bad or rather bad at 8.1% of households, compared to 11.2% of the year before and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of households of people working on their own account is best.
In this group it is considered to be good or rather good that 70% of respondents have passed it.
At the second run are households of the domestic renaissance, where the percentage of such responses amounted to only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is known to parents who are self-educated offspring, among which 32% of the good or rather good material situation is declared.
Among couples with children, this weight (depending on the number of children) ranges from 55% to 60% and among homeless households is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before launching (in 2016) the worst material situation was assessed by parents of their own descendants and generations of families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessment of the material situation of Poland is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link between income level and the assessment of the material conditions of the households.
The best estimates are the inhabitants of the Polish Voivodeship, where they consider their situation to be good or rather good 48.9% of the population.
There are also Ljubus voivodships (47.7%), Silesia (47.6%), Mazowice (47.3%) and Westport (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Poland, the regulatory income (i.e. after taxes and contributions) amounted to 94% of the national average and 98% of Lubuska.
The highest incomes were the residents of Mazowiecki (120 per cent of the national average) and Silesian (104 per cent).
On average, in Poland, the person’s regulatory income amounted to EUR 1693 per person in 2018.
In real terms (after a change in price impact adjustment), it increased by 4.3% in 2017.
In the past few years, this has turned out to be quite low.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and by 6.3% later.
Although income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These were calculated per person in sub.r. 1187 zł, which means that in real terms they were reduced by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Studies in household budgets suggest that the domestic statistical economy currently spends 70.1% of its regulatory revenue, while that share still exceeded 80% in 2014 and exceeded 90% by 2006.

USA: Three suicides among the airport crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board USS George H. W. Bush – the American Navy reported.
In the last two years, in total, five members of the crew of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors were shot last week.
Every one of the events happened on the ground when the USS George H. W. Bush landed on the coast of Virginia.
As so far, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Moreover, death is not to be associated with one another.
“It is necessary for everyone to engage in the presentation of suggestions and ideas, how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stigmatization or other impact on the search for help," said Captain Sean Bailey, captain of the ship on Facebook.
It's very critical of the pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In his conversation with Peter Lekszyk Stefan Niesiołski, John Paul II was a huge authority in 1981.
‘In fact, all of his views were accepted.’
Then came the criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzky, a great appreciation for his pontificacy.
On the other hand, the Redemptor – the harmor of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way for the life of Pope Polaka," he explained.
The former PO politicians admitted: “There was a dissatisfaction, the pope said something he had never accepted, but he had authority and he could simply throw it out of the Church or send it to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
But John Paul II did not do so, like his followers," explained Niesiolovski.
“In addition, this fatal cause of paedophilia and the Church’s activities has been achieved, and indeed their absence.
I ran a little ahead of my mind, but I wanted to pay attention to the entire shape of his life.
We've known about the scale of paedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.
There is a question as to how it is possible that John Paul II, as head of the Church, did not know about these horrible things," says Niesiolovski journalist.
In the assessment of the former PO policy, the Church is an ally of PiS.
“You must admit that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the holy Mass, the hanging of the cross everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzyk shake the Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church that will come to pay him the salt," Nesiolovski convinced.
"I hope that the Pope of France will drive the Adriatic, Rydski and a few others of this kind," he said.

Dequalified handle
The old man in Pucharu Polski between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdansk with small hair did not end tragically when the Wejher Rac's kibiks fired by the millimeters past the counter team's gatekeeper, Zlatana Alomerovici.
After this incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
This case was investigated by the PZPN Commission, which was subject to severe punishment by Gryfo, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Pucharza in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the kibbies will not be released in the nearest match at their own stadium.
They will also not be able to go to leagues until 31 December.
Burds at the Vidzev Łódź stadium also called the Ślęska Wrocław kibika.
However, the decision of the PZPN was easier, because Silsk had prevented such events from happening and had felt the appropriate authorities in this regard.
In addition, the services have allowed the industry to be decommissioned by sharks, fuelling chairs and forcing the economic sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use the watercraft.
PZPN imposed a one-time stadium ban in the closest match in Pucharze Polski and banned the organisation of the games in this and the next edition of the PP.
The ban on departures also covered the League Extraclasses, but it will last until 31 December.
The names of foreign cities on road signs also in Poland
GDDKiA plans to exchange the label on the entire managed network of roads by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Wires
In Podcarpaci, the implementation of a new regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on the registration of foreign names of cities on road signs also began in Poland.
For example "Lows" will appear next to "L'viv".
Our village will introduce changes to 94 road signs set at A4 motorways and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, easier and easier.
The new guidelines result from the modernisation of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that local names in neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to the changes that we have prepared, they will finally appear on our roads.
The introduction of a new label begins with the sub-carpack section of the A4 motorway," Andrzej Adamczyk, the infrastructure minister informed.
The changes will be made on 94 road signs set at A4 motorways and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 thousand zł.
In the first order, the new label will be implemented on highway A4, which is scheduled to be completed by 1 November 2019.
How's the idea going to look?
He'll be surrounded without changing the tables, basically by a stick.
They will replace the current local names with the new ones written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Poland, then in the original, in the nuances.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the country where they are located.

Someone shot the windshield.
In the state of Zambrück, in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed a lack of wing problems.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set up a target – in his body was found a hole in the wind.
“The information about the bird was received from the residents of the village of the Wild Animals Rehabilitation Centre in New Soli.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We made it on the spot.
It was right now that something was wrong with him.
We did it fast and precisely so that we wouldn't hurt him and put extra stress on him.
The boat was caught and put into the vet.
After the first picture of RTG, it was known that someone had made a shot of him.
There were fractures in his body," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, a rehabilitation center.
Overtakes in the center
"In the morning they were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, provided access to water, a safe place in the center where it will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly right now.
The release would now be linked to the likely failure to survive the winter," Walasek adds.
The staff will be released in the spring to the same position after being rehabilitated.
After receiving information on the cause of animal health, the authorities intend to inform the public about the prosecution.
It happened in the Forever.
Gowin: "we need to encourage Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the country has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," said the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement on Friday.
Gowin, during the "Day Signals" conversation in Radio Unit, said that trade is being developed by international networks that place so low a margin on Polish producers that Polish companies are not actually able to develop.
Given that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government was trying to measure it at the very beginning of the term of office, but was given "the opposite of the KE".
"We have won the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Law wins the closest elections and forms a government, we will return to this issue," he said.
At the same time, he noted that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, so small trade".
"It will now be necessary to decide whether the government has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission made a mistake in recognizing that Polish retail tax was not permitted by public aid.
The retail tax law established the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% from income between 17 million zł and 170 million zł per month and 1.4% from income above 170 million zł per month.
The tax has been in force since September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated a infringement procedure for EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued then that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be regarded as public aid.
It subsequently found that the damage was implemented in a way that was incompatible with the law.
It also ordered that the tax be suspended until its analysis was completed by the officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree to this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TEU Press Service informed the PAP that the case is now at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
At the moment, we are not aware of whether or not the oral procedure is in motion, namely the hearing of the parties and any debate.
It takes a good couple of months to reach a decision.
"This procedure lasts for an average year," said the PAP source of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How do I get the baby to be baptized?
Several practical solutions are under way.
It is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.
It is often the first time that a child’s whole family is focused on it, celebrating its appearance in the world together.
It's no wonder, then, that freshly boiled mom and dad want their comfort to look the best that day.
Before you make a final decision about the child’s machine, however, ask yourself if it will be convenient as well.
Therefore, you can find many machine kits in the stores that do not provide small appropriate comfort.
So, what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion for the selection of clothes for baptism is the age of the child
In recent years, several-year-olds have been baptized, dressed in white sets, and placed in the same beaks or large tubs.
Today, children entering the Sacrament are often older: a few months, a few months, and even older.
It's not hard to imagine that so much comfort already needs something else to be baptized.
So if your child on the day of baptism has 3 to 4 months, it is likely that Christmas will be spent in the car or in the hands of parents or Christian.
The best way out is to put it in comfortable, cottony sleeps or sets.
Although this wardrobe element is considered to be a daily ceiling, it is enough to search for its sacred options, for example with a falcon or crown.
For the boy the ideal points with the impression of the muscles and the stems will be displayed.
In the case of older children, you may be allowed to have a greater imagination in your wardrobe.
A girl will look pretty in a simple, tiuli dress
Many parents look at the rich, falbanian dress on the side of the bride in a complex with plazas, shepherds and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers are using artificial, non-rehaling materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
Looking for a suitable suit will better look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant machines on cotton undercoats.
Delicate, tiuli, satin dresses, crowns, applications and charming sets will make your daughter look delicious and comfortable.
Ideal suit for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, there was a fashion on a suit that was a copy of the “adult” models.
Polyester sailors and lower, rigid collages or caskets have often made young elegant ones show their dissatisfaction.
Fortunately, today they were taken out by comfortable, cottony kits.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, hairy pillows, and the shirt is decorated from the front to the model of the shirt.
These machines look extremely remarkable, but at the same time they don't touch the movements of the little world.
Kristina Pavłowicz published a statement
Kristina Pavłowicz made a statement at the end of her term of office.
As a result, the PiS sent 110,000 bad savings.
Let us remember that Pavlović ordered his withdrawal from politics.
At the end of his term of office, he has a sum of 110 thousand dollars.
As a result of the statement made by the letter, she is retired with a monthly value of 4,7 thousand dollars.
Pavlović has an apartment worth 570 thousand dollars and a little less that he rents, taking 880 dollars a month.
The mission also invests in industrial metals, assessing the investment of 150 thousand zł.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński published the statement of assets.
Voting on the suspension in proceedings during the Conference of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the proceedings of the Gmin Chamber for an annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, which the government has referred to.
289 ambassadors were promised, against 306.
Usually, the Gmin Chamber does not discuss during the Party Conferences, so that the Ambassadors do not have to give up their participation in them or from parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, in such a crucial time as the last weeks before the British withdrawal from the European Union scheduled for 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the proceedings.
At the request of the government, there were 289 ambassadors, against 306.
Two opposition parties already after the conventions
The absence of a suspension may be taken as a political revenge on the opposition to the Boris Johnson Prime Minister for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was found by the Supreme Court to be incompatible with the law and non-existence) and for the fact that, after the judgment of the judges, he does not wish to apologize for it.
After that decision, the Gmin Izba resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was the performance of Johnson and the next heated debate after it.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking the brexit and avoiding the early elections.
"The time has come to realize the brexit.
It needs to be done to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the citizens' priorities, the health service, the cost of life.
Brexit needs to be realized so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party Conference will begin in Manchester next Sunday and take place on Wednesday 2 October.
The two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson gave, explaining the long suspension of Parliament, was that it was a party conference.
Media: Andrzej Duda accuses Israel of anti-chemical attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," says foreign media.
The President's spokesman has been very critical of these reports.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, such as "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to "Jewish Insider", write that Andrzej Duda, at a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the PP Consulate in New York, said that Israel is guilty of the recent anti-chemical attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katza, who stated in February that "Police raised anti-Semitism with mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said he regrets that Israel has not apologized for the insulting statements of its policies.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish Ambassador to Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by a rapist who shouted, "Polac, Polak".
‘The quote is not only incorrect.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel is responsible for the last anti-chemical attacks in Poland".
According to the Spyhal portal, "it's invented."
According to the speakers "JI" during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivors, who were marked by the Cross of Command of the Order of merit of the RP Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Dudy's words and say that the Jews from Israel "are responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to the source of the Boteach portal, he was going to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who's Banas and what's he guilty of?
Rented by the stone carpenters, the journalist led to the discovery of neglect in Marian Banasi's property statements.
We're summing up another affair that has shaken the governing camp.
TVN journalist Marian Banasz, president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not reported in recent years on the declaration of a 400-metre property stone that is located on the Krakow Podhorz.
More than that, his tenant had sexbiznes in the said stone (so renting rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has been declared to be the guarantee of payment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel noted the irregularities in the Supervision program.
The journalist revealed that people associated with the criminal world rented the stone from Banashia to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
The clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes' services.
On the charge of Banas, he answered inadvertently and inadvertently.
What's interesting is that the stone miners hired a journalist to discover the neglect in Banasi's property statements.
The stone itself was described in them because it was not clear, and the income from the rent was to be reduced.
“The fortune of Marian Banasi and his wife may be between 6 million and 8 million dollars.
In total, couples can praise two homes, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And as a result of the portal analysis, Banasi's stone was worth about 3 million dollars.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office currently controls Marian Banasi's claims in 2015-2019.
Banas said he would suspend his activities in NIK by the time it was finished. "I will go to you for a free leave," he said.
The opposition demands clarification.
"We do not hear that CBA has expanded its investigation or has speeded up the investigation of the claims made by Marian Banasis.
Therefore, we are forced to hand over to the State authorities and to report on the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If the normal Polak had so highly valued the rental of its properties, he would already have 10 controls, a tax domain and a carnival procedure," he added.
He went high, fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
This position was called on 30 August 2019, for a six-year term.
His candidacy was declared by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party.
Banas was previously associated with NIK in the years 1992-2005, acting in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczynski.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008), Banas has held the position of President of the Customs Service and also the Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has been re-sitting at the Chef of the Customs Service and has been managing the National Treasury Administration since 2017.
Banas has served three months as Minister of Finance in the Government of Mateus Morawiecki.
Cooler Master introduces to the market capture for graphics cards
Graphic cards can now really weigh a lot, and this naturally makes room for the category of products that would be empty on the store boards a decade ago.
Such a solution – capture for the ELV8 RGB graphics card – presented Cooler Master.
The new graphics card capture model is not only a functional solution that allows for more secure maintenance of the graphics card without relying solely on PCI-express slot endurance.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring police command will be punished
According to the newspaper, the violation of a particular order of conduct issued by the police is to be a new type of offence, a threat of crime, a arrest or a restriction of liberty.
The police force wants to make this change.
The idea came to the Commission's House on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because now every year more than half a million cases have been brought before Polish courts," we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" has established that the petition that the Independent Police Trade Union writes to the ambassadors on the amendment of the code of conduct has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Excellence.
He would say: “Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official issued within the limits of the law and subject to the provisions of the law shall be liable to imprisonment, imprisonment or restriction of liberty”.
‘Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of the same penalty for those who are unable to carry out orders, prevent or impede the carrying out of the service’, the journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolitj", that although he agrees with the main text of the proposal for a regulation, he is afraid that if it is implemented, it can be used in political demonstrations.
"In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be unfavourable and instead mitigate the situation, rather than exacerbating it," he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens had a positive assessment of police interventions in 2018 and 1.5 million interventions per month were taken into account.
The Bureau is concerned about Europe
I'm writing Topol we have blood.
Among his predecessors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important armed Czech dramatists, today listed in a row with Václav Havl.
So over Jachham, there was a curse of talent that he was trying to use from the beginning.
After eight years, he returned with "A Sensitive Man".
The heroes are Buras and Sonya along with two sons, but they do not create a typical Czech family.
They're aquatic actors, they're traveling across Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth didn't make a sound, and for the other, he stopped in childhood.
But these are not heroes in this story.
All of them are the only background to watch a world where there is no room for artists to watch.
It's a world of intrusive provinces, old societies, suspicious people, and unresolved youth.
"A sensitive man" places itself into an absurd theater.
Narration follows didascalia, and the conversation of heroes creates this world.
The scene is Europe is full of concern about its future, but also persistent questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to bankruptcy Thomas Cook
Although the British travel office Thomas Cook fell, his Belgian daughter Neckermann works.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT TV, the Brussels Airlines reported that they cancelled 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All departures with an office that has been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but they will be able to receive a refund in time.
In Gandawi, the court also announced the fall of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are staying abroad on trips purchased by Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave with the office by the end of the year.
Even on Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is currently "fully operational" despite a British company's announcement of bankruptcy, a mother who caused anxiety among employees and clients.
The office then arranged that the customers who bought the trips in it would go on a vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel offices in the world – announced a fall at night from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was to break off Sunday's last chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors claimed that, in addition to the rescue plan already agreed in August, the company received an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period when the travel office usually has lower rotations.
However, the company's problems have grown over the years, resulting in a debt of 1.6 billion pounds.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrival of German Görlitz.
The actions will help to combat the ongoing decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is the most moved to the east of the city of Germany.
A beautiful pastel shop attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is struggling with significant problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also competes with a permanent settlement of the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the western part of the country, which led to a 25% decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it accounted for 54 thousand people.
To fight the population, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
As far as the programme is concerned, 150 applications have been made.
Two thirds of them made the inhabitants of large cities.
The program also took an interest in individuals from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought that the program would convince people to move to Görlitz," one of the project participants said.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here for four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move on a permanent basis, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the participants.
Information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is helping to revive smaller German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with the idea of allowing new residents, offering encouragement in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, who introduced a payment program that promised young specialists life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the American Tulsa in Oklahoma state.
